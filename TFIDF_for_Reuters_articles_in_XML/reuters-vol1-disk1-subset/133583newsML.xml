<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday urged Israel to fulfil the peacemaking legacy of its assassinated prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin.</p>
<p>&quot;On the anniversary of his death, I ask all men and women of goodwill to join me in adding to the memory of this remarkable cman by carrying on the struggle for security and peace for Israel and reconciliation for the peoples of the Middle East,&quot; Clinton said in remarks broadcast on Israel's state-run Channel One television.</p>
<p>&quot;Yitzhak Rabin made that struggle his life's work. Now it is our responsibility to make good on his legacy,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>The television said the remarks were taken from an interview with Clinton to be broadcast on Wednesday night as part of a series of special programmes this week marking the Hebrew calendar anniversary of Rabin's assassination.</p>
<p>A right-wing religious Jew, Yigal Amir, gunned down Rabin on November 4 as he left a peace rally in Tel Aviv. Amir, serving a life sentence in prison for the murder, said he shot Rabin to stop him handing land to Palestinians under a peace deal.</p>
<p>Israel handed six West Bank towns to Palestinian rule at the end of 1995 under the deal Rabin's government signed with the Palestine Liberation Organisation in September of that year.</p>
<p>Hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ousted Rabin's successor Shimon Peres in a general election in May, has put the handover of Hebron, the seventh town under the deal, on hold while seeking changes to enhance security for 400 Jewish settlers living in the town amid 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO are at present, with U.S. mediation, negotiating how to implement the Hebron deal.</p>
