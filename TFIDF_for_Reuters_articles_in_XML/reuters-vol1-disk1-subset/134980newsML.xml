<p>The world advertising industry has invited European consumer organisations to talks about their charges of covert and harmful advertising directed at children.</p>
<p>The European consumer organisation BEUC demanded European Union legislation a month ago to clamp down on what it said was increasingly devious advertising aimed at children.</p>
<p>BEUC said children encountered advertising from morning to evening, at home, at school and at play, and it was often so deviously presented that they did not recognise it as such.</p>
<p>The World Federation of Advertisers, which said it groups major national associations of advertisers and corporate advertisers throughout the world, announced on Tuesday it was ready to discuss the possibility of industry self-regulation with BEUC.</p>
<p>Self-regulation rather than regulation should be the main agenda item, it said in a statement while rejecting the charges that it carried out covert and harmful advertising.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing undesirable or hidden about companies using a wide range of communication media to engage the interest of children and parents,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The charges of covert advertising were based on a limited number of research studies, it said.</p>
