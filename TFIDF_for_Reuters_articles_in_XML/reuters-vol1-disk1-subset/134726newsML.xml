<p>Jordan's Zara Investments, the leading tourism investment holding company, announced on Tuesday a private placement to raise its capital to 40 million dinars ($56 milllion) by this year, company officials said.</p>
<p>The company's 15 million dinar capital increase will be through a private placement offered to the 147 existing shareholders. The issue has to be covered by November 16, company officials added.</p>
<p>&quot;The capital increase will finance some of the capital costs of our estimated $180 million projects that are due for completion by 1999,&quot; said Saleh al-Rifai, general manager of Zara Investments Holdings Company, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Zara, which is listed on the primary market of the Amman Finacial Market (AFM), had approved in an extraordinary AGM last September a capital raise to 40 million dinars from 25 million dinars.</p>
<p>The capital hike will help Zara complete an estimated $180 million dollars of hotel construction projects, the largest private sector hotel construction undertaken in Jordan by a sole firm.</p>
<p>Zara was set up in 1994 by investors and institutions, including a key 16 percent stake by Cairo-Amman Bank and similar stakes by two leading Jordanian investors, Khalil Talhouni and Sabih al-Masri.</p>
<p>The company which pins hopes on a projected tourism boom after Jordan's peace treaty with Israel also acquired a key 27.7 percent stake in the five-star InterContinetal managed hotel owned by Jordan Hotel and Tourism. A $20 expansion programme is underway to add an extra 150 rooms by 1998.</p>
<p>Rifai said Zara had already received a commitment from the IFC, the World Bank's private investment arm, to hold a $3 million stake in its equity capital.</p>
<p>Zara was also negotiating with Arab Bank to enter as a shareholder while also getting financing but no final agreement has been reached yet, Rifai added.</p>
<p>Rifai said IFC had agreed to provide a $15 million loan to the companies three main projects currently being constructed at an estimated over $100 million.</p>
<p>Zara's U.S chain Haytt Regency managed five star 313-room hotel in Amman will be ready by end 1998 at a cost of around $42 million with an adjoining $30 million trade centre building currently under construction. A $35 million 231 room Swiss Moevenpick managed Dead Sea village resort will be opened first quarter 1999.</p>
<p>Zara opened recently its first Swiss Moevenpick managed 179 room hotel in the famed Nabatean city of Petra at a cost of around 14 million dinars.</p>
