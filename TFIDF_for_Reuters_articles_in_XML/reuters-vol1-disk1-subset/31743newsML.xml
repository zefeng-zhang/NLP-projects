<title>BRAZIL: Brazil shares recoup early losses to end higher.</title>
<headline>Brazil shares recoup early losses to end higher.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1996-09-03</dateline>

<p>Brazilian stocks reversed early losses to close up slightly in mild trade, following the Dow's rise on falling U.S. interest rates and speculation over oil prices stemming from turmoil in Iraq, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market is still very closely linked to overseas,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index of 49 most traded shares rose 375 points to end at 62,700 points, up 0.60 percent on trade totalling 345.7 million reais.  </p>
<p>Brokers said Brazilian shares started the day downward on gloom due to a hike in U.S interest rates and worries of war in Iraq. But prices, tracking the Dow Jones, did an about-face late in the morning as interest rates began declining and world oil prices were hit by speculation, they said.</p>
<p>The rise in the Bovespa, which extended trade by a half hour due to technical problems in updating quotes, was led by benchmark Telebras, whose shares and options comprised 72 percent of total volume.</p>
<p>Telebras preferred ended 0.53 percent higher at 75.80 reais and its common closed up 0.51 percent at 61.50 reais.  </p>
<p>Most other blue chips also ended higher in the rollercoaster session, albeit on thin trade.</p>
<p>Brazil's state oil monopoly Petrobras, which recently resatarted purchases of Iraqi crude, ended the day a slight 0.41 percent higher at 120.00 reais.</p>
<p>State mining giant Vale do Rio Doce climbed 1.55 percent to 19.65 reais.</p>
<p>The bolsa's Electrical Energy Index of nine most-liquid shares rose 1.83 percent to 1,573 points.</p>
<p>Power firm Eletrobras moved up 0.72 percent to 281.00 reais.</p>
