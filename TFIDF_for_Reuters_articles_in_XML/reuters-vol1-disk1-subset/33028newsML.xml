<p>Kurdish fighters loyal to Massoud Barzani roamed the streets of Arbil on Wednesday, as local residents struggled to cope with searing heat, no water and no electricity.</p>
<p>Many shops were closed, but the streets were calm and the first reporters into Arbil since Baghdad's soldiers and Barzani's guerrillas captured it from a rival Kurdish faction at the weekend saw no sign of Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) boss for Arbil, Fadil Mirani, told reporters his forces were in an alliance with the Iraqi army to combat aggression by Iran and &quot;treachery&quot; by Jalal Talabani, leader of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
<p>&quot;We were forced by the PUK and Iranian aggression. We were in circumstances: 'to be or not to be.' We did not ask the Iraqi army to stay or to occupy, we did not ask for their air force.&quot;</p>
<p>Mirani said more than 100 people were killed in the fighting, but that civilians had been largely unharmed.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think more than 150 to 180 people were killed on both sides. Fortunately we have no reports of civilians killed. They stayed inside to escape the fighting.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the reported execution of nearly 100 Iraqi defectors in the nearby camp of Qushtapa, Mirani said:</p>
<p>&quot;I personally deny that because I haven't seen it. You are free to go anywhere in the city and find out what you can find.&quot;</p>
<p>Reporters went to the Kurdish parliament building on the southwestern edge of the town. The facade of the building was holed by tank shells and showed signs of fighting over the weekend.</p>
<p>A bullet-ridden bus stood to one side of the driveway. The building was empty, guarded by a handful of KDP guerrillas wilting under the blazing sun.</p>
<p>The empty, battle-scarred building symbolised the collapse of the Kurdish effort for democracy and government.</p>
<p>It was in this building that the Kurdish parliament sat in May of 1992 after Iraqi Kurdistan's first democratic elections.</p>
<p>At the time Talabani and KDP chief Barzani agreed to an equal share of power, dividing the seats in the house down the middle.</p>
<p>But soon afterwards fratricidal fighting ensued and after countless broken ceasefires the PUK captured the shared city of Arbil in December 1994.</p>
<p>The latest in a series of peace talks was due to take place in London the day Arbil was attacked.</p>
<p>An elderly KDP guerrilla guarding the parliament building, Mohammed Khaled Bosali, said three KDP and six PUK fighters were killed in the battle there.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little bit of shelling and I did not see any Iraqi tanks and soldiers in the fighting,&quot; Bosali said.</p>
<p>Reporters speaking to civilians in Arbil encountered one taxi driver who told them he had seen tanks in the city as well as soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mukhabarat (Iraqi secret service) is still in the city, but they are dressed in civilian clothes,&quot; he said.</p>
