<p>Alliance leader Jim Anderton on Monday said former New Zealand First strategist Michael Laws was wrong to portray the Alliance as an obstacle to productive coalition talks between the main opposition Labour Party and New Zealand First.</p>
<p>In a television interview Laws said the two would &quot;almost need a written contract&quot; guaranteeing the Alliance would support them &quot;on all matters relating to confidence and supply for the next three years&quot;.  </p>
<p>New Zealand First opens discussion to form a coalition government with the ruling National Party today and with Labour on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the basis of election night results, a National-New Zealand First coalition would have 61 seats in the 120-seat parliament, but Labour and New Zealand First between them would command only 54 seats and would need the tacit or explicit support of the 13 Alliance MPs to govern.</p>
<p>But Anderton said in a statement the Alliance had contributed a positive issues paper to both Labour and New Zealand First to assist discussions.  </p>
<p>&quot;This has been done so that the parties and the public will be able to see where the Alliance stands. Mr Laws is trying to portray this open, helpful approach as some kind of obstacle.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderton said Laws was using innuendo to imply the Alliance had some internal problems to work through over the next week to 10 days.</p>
<p>The co-leader of the Green Party -- one of the five parties in the Alliance -- said Laws was &quot;deliberately stirring&quot;.  </p>
<p>Rod Donald said he had no idea what Laws was referring to when he spoke of internal problems the Alliance had to work out. &quot;I don't have a clue. I think Laws is deliberately stirring. There is no major issue that I am aware of over the next seven to 10 days that we have to tackle.&quot;</p>
<p>He sais the party would finalise select committee membership and spokesmanships as well as a full report to the November council meeting on the campaign &quot;but hardly anything of great moment in terms of what he is talking about&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;He ought to have a look at our paper. (New Zealand First leader) Winston Peters has not only requested a copy of the paper... but also a full copy of our policy to actually look through. And we have stated very clearly what our requirements are before we will support someone on confidence issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Donald said it might be more straightforward for New Zealand First to deal with National in the short term but not necessarily in the long term.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on how pragmatic Winston wants to be in all this. Is he in it to be deputy Prime Minister, shaft (Prime Minister) Jim Bolger and get a few people into Cabinet, or is he there because he has a commitment to achieve some policy objectives?&quot;</p>
<p>But he said Labour and New Zealand First would need to sort out their differences before they presented a united approach to the Alliance. &quot;They have got to sort out their act before it is worth talking to us.&quot;</p>
<p>Donald said Laws was dreaming if he thought there could be a written promise of support on confidence issues for three years.  </p>
<p>&quot;He obviously hasn't read our paper because we state quite clearly... that we are seeking a written agreement that Labour will a) commit to the policy programme it put before the electorate as opposed to backing off from the social policy, in particular, and b) that it will work through the policy requests we have made to come up with a programme that is more acceptable to us. On that basis we are in a position to offer something in return in terms of confidence.&quot;</p>
