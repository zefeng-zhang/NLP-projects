<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual began an official friendship visit to Vietnam on Monday which local media said was aimed at breaking down political isolation.</p>
<p>Young women in traditional silk dresses tossed flowers in front of the Algerian leader as he arrived at the presidential palace in Hanoi for talks with his Vietnamese counterpart Le Duc Anh.</p>
<p>The semi-official Vietnam Investment Review said the visit would focus on &quot;breaking down Algeria's political isolation by strengthening its foothold in Asia&quot; and quoted a foreign ministry official as saying economic cooperation would follow.</p>
<p>It said a series of investment and cultural exchange agreements were expected to be signed.</p>
<p>The trip is the first to Vietnam by Zeroual since his election victory last November, and the first by an Algerian leader in 22 years.</p>
<p>The two countries, both members of the Non-Aligned Movement, have strong traditional ties and a number of Vietnamese academics and other workers are resident in the North African country.</p>
<p>The official Nhan Dan daily, the mouthpiece of Vietnam's Communist Party, described the visit as marking a new development in relations.</p>
<p>&quot;Algeria has actively supported our revolutionary cause in the past as well as at present... We believe this visit by Algerian President Liamine Zeroual will further strengthen and consolidate friendship and cooperation,&quot; it said.</p>
