<title>USA: NYMEX crude ends lower on Iraqi troop withdrawal.</title>
<headline>NYMEX crude ends lower on Iraqi troop withdrawal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX crude prices ended lower Wednesday on news that Iraqi troops had pulled out of Kurdish regions in northern Iraq, but selling was limited by continued uncertainty in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a combination of the uncertainty and the fundamentals. We are still not getting 700,000 barrels,&quot; said Rita Beale, an analyst with Fimat USA Futures, of the limited sell off following news of the Iraqi troop withdrawal.</p>
<p>October crude settled off 16 cents to $23.24 a barrel. October heating oil fell 0.86 cent to 64.21 cents a gallon while October gasoline ended unchanged at 62.96 cents.  </p>
<p>The sharper drop in heating oil futures reflected weakness in the cash market where heating oil and low sulphur diesel differentials slipped by about 0.35/0.40 cent a gallon from yesterday, a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said the weaker cash prices may have been in anticipation of the higher-than-expected weekly heating oil stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Just the same, Beale expects the oil complex to continue its general trend upward.</p>
<p>&quot;The uptrend is still in place,&quot; Fimat's Beale said.  </p>
<p>The United Nations suspended the Iraqi oil-for-food deal on Sunday in response to military incursions by Iraqi troops into Kurdish territories in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate the deal would have added about 700,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil to the market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders remain cautious of further developments in Iraq which could destabilize the region and drive oil prices higher.</p>
<p>&quot;You never know what's going to happen. So they (the troops) have withdrawn? I am real skeptical,&quot; a trader said.</p>
