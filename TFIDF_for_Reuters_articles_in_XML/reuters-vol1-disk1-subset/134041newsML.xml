<text>
<p>More than 300 mourners gathered at a Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt on Tuesday to bury Jakub Fiszman, a 40-year-old businessman kidnapped and brutally murdered in a case that shook Germany.</p>
<p>Fiszman's badly beaten body was found in dense woodlands north of Frankfurt on Saturday. He was abducted on October 1 and despite the payment of a four million mark ($2.61 million) ransom, was killed on October 4, police said.</p>
<p>Leaders of Germany's vestigial Jewish community attended the closely guarded ceremony, held in Hebrew and in German. After the burial, the mourners marched silently into Frankfurt's city centre.</p>
<p>Georg Fiszman, the victim's brother who had paid four million marks in ransom to the kidnappers, said Jakub Fiszman was a generous man. His family was still numbed by the murder.</p>
<p>Ignatz Bubis, the leader of the central council of Jews in Germany, was at the funeral, which attracted national media coverage.</p>
<p>Speakers at the ceremony said the Jewish community was speechless at the brutality of Jakub Fiszman's abductors.</p>
<p>Outside the graveyard, security guards in bullet-proof vests watched over the proceedings.</p>
<p>Police are holding Rainer Koerppen, 48, and his son Sven, 26, in connection with Fiszman's abduction and murder, and a third man is still being sought.</p>
<p>While Sven has admitted he took part in the kidnapping, both men deny murdering Fiszman. ($1=1.5323 Mark)</p>
