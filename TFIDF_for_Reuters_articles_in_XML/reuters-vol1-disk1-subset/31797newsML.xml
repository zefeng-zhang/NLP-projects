<p>Argentina is considering launching a 30-year bond as part of the remaining $4 billion of debt the government wants to issue through the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Deputy Finance Secretary Miguel Angel Kiguel confirmed to Reuters the Economy Ministry is studying the option of a 30-year bond. &quot;It is one of the plans we are considering,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kiguel acknowledged &quot;there have been offers&quot; for the bond and suggested it could be a global issue.  </p>
<p>But he stressed that nothing has been decided and that many options are being studied. Local media suggested a $1 billion 30-year bond could be issued.</p>
<p>One option under consideration is the re-opening of the 20-year mark bond issued on Tuesday. Argentina placed 375 million marks of bonds with a 12 percent coupon at a price of 101.50 due September 2016. The lead manager was CSFB-Effectenbank.</p>
<p>Analysts welcomed the possibility of a 30-year bond issue.  </p>
<p>&quot;The fact that there are (underwriting) offers is the good thing,&quot; said one fixed-income analyst at a large foreign bank. Offers to underwrite Argentine debt indicate Argentina will have less trouble financing its deficit in coming months, analysts said.</p>
<p>But whatever the government may be considering on debt issues, it could all come to nothing if Congress fails to pass the government's proposal to raise the debt ceiling for this year by $4 billion.  </p>
<p>Roque Fernandez, the Economy Minister, asked Congress a couple of weeks ago to raise the debt limit. Congress approved a debt ceiling of $7 billion for the year early in 1996 and that limit has already been reached.</p>
<p>Kiguel said he did not anticipate Congress' decision before October or November, meaning nothing will be decided on a 30-year bond until then.</p>
<p>Roberto Costa Bourdieu, senior fixed-income analyst at Banco Rio de la Plata, said he thought it would be relatively easy for Argentina to issue a 30-year bond. Argentina has Brady bonds with 30-year maturities.  </p>
<p>&quot;When you have a track record with 20-year issues, it would be easy to launch a 30-year bond,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He expected there would be institutional and pension fund interest in a 30-year issue.</p>
<p>The analyst at the large foreign bank said a 30-year bond &quot;would definitely have a tighter spread than restructured notes.&quot;</p>
<p>Argentina would be the second Latin American country to issue a 30-year bond after Mexico. The analyst estimated that Argentina's 30-year would likely trade around 200 basis points above Mexico's 30-year issue, which currently yields around 480 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Even though the analyst said talk of the issue was good news, he thought Argentina could probably get cheaper financing through shorter maturities such as 10 or 20 years.</p>
