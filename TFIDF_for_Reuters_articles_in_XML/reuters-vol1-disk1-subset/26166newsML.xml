<p>Heavy rain on the 17th lap stopped the Imola 500cc motorcycling Grand Prix on Sunday, giving Australian Michael Doohan victory in the 500th championship race since 1949.</p>
<p>The sudden storm literally cast a cloud over what was shaping up to be a gripping wheel-to-wheel battle between the world champion and Honda team mate Alex Criville.</p>
<p>Young Spaniard Criville had taken the previous two grands prix and was just 0.104 of a second behind Doohan on the 16th lap, which counted as the final result.</p>
<p>Race rules state that a grand prix must be two-thirds completed before a victory can be given, with the results being counted from the lap before the stoppage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the race is re-started with wet tyres.</p>
<p>Sunday's grand prix was supposed to have been over 24 laps, meaning that the race would have had to restart had the torrential downpour arrived just one lap earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Even before it started I was worried about the clouds coming,&quot; said Doohan. &quot;I had heard it was raining in Milan and the wind started to blow five laps before the stop.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure that it was blowing Alex around a lot because it was blowing me about quite a bit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The result left Doohan 57 points clear of Criville in the championship with just three races left.  </p>
<p>Doohan, whose qualifying time on Friday gave him pole position when rain on Saturday ruled out any attempt to better it by his rivals, led the race from start to finish.</p>
<p>Criville, who had to start on the second row after a high-speed fall on Friday, snatched third place at the green light and swiftly moved up into Doohan's slipstream on the second lap by overtaking Japan's Tadayuki Okada.</p>
<p>Okada, in the same team as the two leaders but on a different bike, was third at the end while France's Jean-Michel Bayle was fourth -- his best in his first season.</p>
<p>&quot;We were getting faster and faster,&quot; said Doohan, who predicted an even closer race if it had continued.</p>
<p>The two men played cat-and-mouse as the race progressed, Doohan occasionally pulling away slightly for a lap and then being reeled in again by the start of the next.</p>
<p>&quot;I upped the pace with 10 laps to go and would have done so again with five left,&quot; said Doohan. &quot;I think I had a little in reserve and he hadn't come past yet.&quot;</p>
<p>None of the riders had raced before at Imola, which was returning to the Grand Prix circuit after eight years with the track redesigned after Formula One drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in crashes here in 1994.</p>
<p>Certainly, none of the riders were complaining about the decision to stop the race on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We could have kept running on for a lap,&quot; said Doohan, who slowed and raised his left hand to warn Criville as the downpour started and marshalls flagged down riders.</p>
<p>&quot;One or all of us could have crashed and the race would still have been taken back a lap anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's better to stop and restart than to try and play games with 200 horsepower on a wet track with slicks.</p>
<p>Doohan dedicated his win to race doctor Claudio Costa, son of the founder of Imola racetrack, who treated the Australian after a bad crash in the Netherlands in 1992.</p>
<p>Italian Max Biaggi, two time 250cc champion, fell at Piratello corner in the 11th lap of a 250 race on by Germany's Ralf Waldmann on a Honda. The result blew the world championship wide open again, with Biaggi leading by 12 points.</p>
<p>The 125cc championship also tightened when overall leader Haruchika Aoki went out on the 15th lap, with compatriot Masaki Tokudome winning and cutting Aoki's lead to three points.</p>
<p>There are three races remaining this season.</p>
