<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian prince seeks king's permission to return.</title>
<headline>Cambodian prince seeks king's permission to return.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sirivudh, exiled last year for allegedly plotting to kill one of the country's two premiers, has written to the king asking for permission to return home from France.</p>
<p>Sirivudh, a former foreign minister who has denied any involvement in an alleged plot to assassinate Second Prime Minister Hun Sen last year, wrote to his half brother King Norodom Sihanouk on October 3.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the honour to respectfully ask Your Very Venerated Majesty to condescend to grant authorisation to return to Cambodia,&quot; said the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Separated from my wife and my child, and having done no harm to anyone, I wish to return simply to serve our people in a spirit of national reconciliation,&quot; added the prince, whose family have remained in Cambodia since he left the country in late December.</p>
<p>The prince, formerly number two of the royalist FUNCINPEC party and still a member of parliament, was later sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in absentia on charges linked to the alleged plot against Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP).</p>
<p>FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who did not oppose the fall of Sirivudh, suggested last month his relative write to the king and ask for an amnesty.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he would support it given the pardon of top Khmer Rouge figure Ieng Sary.</p>
<p>Sirivudh, in a letter to Ranariddh dated October 3, thanked the first prime minister for his support and said he believed stability in Cambodia depended on continued cooperation between FUNCINPEC and CPP, the main parties in the fragile coalition.</p>
<p>King Sihanouk granted an amnesty to Ieng Sary in September, about one month after he broke with hardline Khmer Rouge forces loyal to Pol Pot.</p>
<p>The pardon, releasing Ieng Sary from a death sentence for his role in the genocide of more than one million people as foreign minister during the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge rule, allowed peace talks with the government to resume.</p>
<p>Sihanouk is known to be in favour of almost blanket amnesties given the mercy shown Ieng Sary, but says he does not want to act without the support of both premiers.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's position on a pardon for Sirivudh is not known but political and diplomatic sources said there is no love lost between the two men.</p>
