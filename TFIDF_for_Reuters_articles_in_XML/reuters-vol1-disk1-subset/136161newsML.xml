<p>Norfolk Southern Corp asked the U.S. District Court to declare that a proposed merger between Conrail Inc and CSX Corp violates U.S. and Pennsylvania law.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern also asked the court to block CSX's tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, and to block a Conrail shareholders meeting set for Nov 14 to facilitate the merger.  </p>
<p>Norfolk Southern also said in the suit that it would seek to replace Conrail's board of directors at the company's annual meeting on May 21, 1997.</p>
<p>In the suit, Norfolk Southern said Conrail had rejected a 1994 offer of a 1.1-to-1 stock swap merger that would have been worth $101 per share on Oct 14, 1996, the day before the CSX merger was announced.</p>
<p>It said Conrail rejected a renewed Norfolk Southern approach as recently as October 4, and therefore had to have known that higher offers than CSX's were available. The suit said after the merger was announced, CSX told Norfolk Southern the deal was &quot;bulletproof&quot; and Norfolk Southern could only negotiate for access to the rail system of the merged company.</p>
<p>The suit said a $300 million break-up fee in the CSX-Conrail deal was excessive, as was a stock option &quot;lock-up&quot;, which it said imposed an increasingly severe disincentive to higher bids.</p>
<p>It said the lock-up would dilute Norfolk Southern's stake in Conrail by $120 million if Norfolk Southern's cash bid of $100 per share for Conrail were successful, and by more if a higher bid were made.</p>
