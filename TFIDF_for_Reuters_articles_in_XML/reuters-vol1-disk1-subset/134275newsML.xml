<p>Gazprom dominated an otherwise quiet Russian share market on Tuesday, rising strongly after announcing a price of $15.75 for its American Depositary Shares the previous day, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gazprom was one of the day's strongest gainers and the most active by turnover, with $5.85 million of shares changing hands on the Russian Trading System -- one third of total volume.</p>
<p>It closed at $0.505, off an early $0.530 high, after closing on Monday at $0.480. One ADS is equivalent to 10 shares.</p>
<p>A trader at Troika-Dialog said the Russian market was not much affected by the news as the domestic and international markets were separated.</p>
<p>According to Gazprom rules, foreigners cannot buy cheap Russian shares on the domestic market, while Russian operators cannot buy shares on the international market.</p>
<p>Gazprom bids rose to $0.500 on Tuesday, but there were many sellers at that level, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the shares could rise further.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of all Russian shares Gazprom has the biggest potential from the point of view of its quotes growth, but when the rise will happen I cannot say,&quot; said the Troika trader.</p>
