<headline>Iraq says US cruise missiles attacked Baghdad.</headline>
<dateline>BAGHDAD 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Iraq said the United States had fired missiles against military bases and civilian areas in the capital Baghdad on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;At 8.45 p.m. the American enemy directed its failing missiles against our military bases and civilian places and a number of them have fallen in Baghdad,&quot; Iraqi state television reported, quoting a statement by the general command of the Iraqi armed forces.</p>
<p>Earlier in Washington the Pentagon denied it had launched any attack against the Iraqi capital. Residents in Baghdad heard several large explosions, as well as anti-aircraft fire, but did not know what had caused them.  </p>
<p>The Iraqi military statement said a number of people were killed in the attacks but did not say how many.</p>
<p>The statement called U.S. President Bill Clinton a &quot;war criminal&quot;.</p>
<p>Iraqi air defence were able to shoot down many of the missiles, the statement said.</p>
<p>Clinton, speaking to reporters earlier in Washington shortly after reports of explosions in Baghdad, denied the United States had launched attacks against the capital.</p>
<p>The United States said it launched a total of 44 cruise missiles against military targets in southern Iraq early on Tuesday and on Wednesday morning following Iraq's military incursion against areas of Kurdish-held northern Iraq at the weekend.</p>
