<title>SINGAPORE: Singapore non-oil exports fall in September.</title>
<headline>Singapore non-oil exports fall in September.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Singapore's non-oil exports fell 6.2 percent year-on-year in nominal terms in September due to a slowdown in the worldwide electronics industry, the Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Total non-oil domestic exports totalled Singapore $7.31 billion (US$5.18 billion) last month.</p>
<p>In August, the city-state's non-oil domestic exports fell 6.3 percent to S$7.01 billion.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of 12 Singapore-based economists had predicted a nominal year-on-year fall of 3.4 percent in September.  </p>
<p>A TDB statement said non-oil exports to the United States increased marginally by 1.2 percent to S$2.3 billion in September, but exports to Europe, Japan and neighbouring Malaysia all fell.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-oil domestic exports declined by 6.2 percent due to the continued sluggishness in global electronics demand,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Electronics, computers and related products account for about half Singapore's total industrial production and almost 60 percent of its non-oil exports.  </p>
<p>In real terms, non-oil exports fell 2.5 percent in September to S$9.29 billion after falling 2.8 percent in August.</p>
<p>The biggest percentage fall in exports was seen for telecommunication equipment, which registered a 23.7 percent year-on-year fall in September.</p>
<p>Exports of electrical machinery and electronic valves also fell sharply, by 16.2 percent and 11.7 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Analysts said the figures confirmed their generally pessimistic view of the prospects for the Singapore economy as a whole for 1996.  </p>
<p>P.K. Basu, regional economist at UBS in Singapore, said the export data reinforced his view that the city-state's gross domestic product (GDP) was likely to grow by about 5.7 percent in 1996, after 8.8 percent in 1995 and 10.2 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>Paul Schymyck, head of research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, who had expected the September export figures to show a rebound from the slump in August, said he would now consider revising downwards his forecast for Singapore's 1996 growth.</p>
<p>&quot;It is worse than expected,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it would lead to a further reduction of our (growth) forecast for the year by perhaps 0.5 percent to close to six percent.&quot;  </p>
