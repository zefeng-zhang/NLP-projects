<headline>Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilly post strong results; stocks jump. [CORRECTED 18:40 GMT]</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Tuesday its earnings rose 9 percent (Corrects from 93 percent)</p>
<p>in the latest quarter, while Eli Lilly &amp; Co. chalked up a strong 34 percent profit increase.</p>
<p>Wall Street rewarded the drug makers by boosting their stocks to new highs for the year.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly's stock jumped $2.25 to a new high of $71 and Bristol-Myers was up $1.50 at $105.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers said it profits jumped nearly 93 percent to $753.0 million, or $1.50 a share, in the third quarter on revenues of $3.74 billion. The results compared with year-ago earnings of $689.0 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenues of $3.41 billion.</p>
<p>The New York-based company said strong worldwide sales of its pharmaceutical products more than offset a large drop in U.S. sales of its Capoten heart drug following the expiration of its U.S. patent.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers said U.S. Capoten sales plunged 72 percent in the quarter as a result of the patent's loss in February and competition from lower-priced generics.</p>
<p>It did not provide a dollar figure for Capoten sales, but noted that worldwide Capoten sales are still expected to exceed $1 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>The drug maker said its overall revenues were boosted by a 35 percent jump in sales of its cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol to $261 million.</p>
<p>Consumer product sales rose 12 percent in the quarter, driven by hair-colouring and hair care products, including Nice n Easy and Natural Instincts.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers said its nutritional product sales grew 10 percent, while medical device product revenues were flat.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly said its profits increased 34 percent to $415.6 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with year-ago profits of $310.5 million, or 54 cents a share. Sales rose 11 percent to $1.804 billion from $1.632 billion.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis-based company said its results were boosted by the sale of the U.S. marketing rights for its Ceclor CD and Keftab antibiotic drugs to Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $100 million, which increased  earnings by 12 cents a share.</p>
<p>&quot;The third quarter marked accelerated growth in the sale of our products and improved control of our costs,&quot; said Randall Tobias, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;In addition, we have heavily supported the launches of several important new products.&quot;</p>
<p>Eli Lilly said sales of its anti-depressant drug Prozac increased 10 percent despite competition from generic forms of Prozac in Canada and substantial competitive pressures in France.</p>
