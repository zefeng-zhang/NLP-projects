<p>Tens of thousands of exhausted Hutu refugees and displaced Zaireans flooded towards the city of Bukavu in eastern Zaire on Tuesday, fleeing fighting between soldiers and Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis further south.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency in Geneva warned of an impending humanitarian disaster and relief workers in Bukavu prepared to fly out 54 expatriate colleagues trapped by fighting in the town of Uvira near the border with Burundi.</p>
<p>The Zairean army brought reinforcements of troops and artillery to Bukavu, where it set up a cannon outside the cathedral aimed in the direction of nearby Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw tens of thousands of refugees on the road,&quot; Reuters photographer Corinne Dufka said after returning from the town of Nyangezi. &quot;There was a constant and stready stream of Rwandan refugees and displaced Zaireans.&quot;</p>
<p>In Geneva, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Ron Redmond, said many of the 222,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees who left the 12 camps in the Uvira region over the weekend remained in the surrounding hills.</p>
<p>He said relief workers feared an emergency of the kind that followed the 1994 massacres in Rwanda of minority Tutsis by Hutu hardliners and the exodus that followed of Hutus fearing reprisals.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to all sides to step back from the brink of what now threatens to become a very real humanitarian disaster in a region that has already suffered enough,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dufka and other journalists, who managed to travel 10 km south of Nyangezi on the road towards Uvira, spoke of armed soldiers walking with the refugees who she said looked adequately fed.</p>
<p>The fighting has fuelled fears that the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry which triggered the 1994 genocide of almost a million Tutsis in Rwanda and the equally bitter civil war in Burundi could engulf the whole Central African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>There was no reliable death toll from the fighting which flared on Friday. Humanitarian sources said relief workers in Uvira area had asked for 78 body shrouds and had spoken of 60 wounded, mostly civilians.</p>
<p>Earlier reports had 28 civilians killed near Uvira on Friday and a Zairean soldier killed near Goma in the north on Sunday.</p>
<p>Zaire accuses the Tutsi-dominated army in Rwanda of stirring up trouble in its already volatile eastern refugee zone by sending in Banyamulenge infiltrators. Rwanda denies the charge.</p>
<p>The Banyamulenge, ethnic Tutsis who arrived in Zaire from Rwanda late in the 18th century, accuse indigenous Zaireans of trying to force them to leave.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports spoke of a Rwandan incursion near Goma over the weekend and Rwandan troops creating a corridor for Banyamulenge to enter near Ruzizi plain in the south. The Rwandan army has denied any link with the conflict.</p>
