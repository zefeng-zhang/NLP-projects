<p>Her Grand Slam hopes at the French Open and Wimbledon were shattered by early-round upsets, but Monica Seles delivered an emphatic boost to her U.S. Open aspirations by humbling Amanda Coetzer Tuesday.</p>
<p>Seles, the 22-year-old second seed, unleashed the full repertoire of her shots on the unseeded South African in a 6-0 6-3 quarter-final shellacking that took just 48 minutes under the National Tennis Centre stadium lights.</p>
<p>&quot;I definitely wanted to come out attacking and play my game,&quot; said Seles, who was ousted in the Wimbledon second round after crashing out in the quarter-finals at the French Open.</p>
<p>In the opening set, Coetzer, the highest-ranked player not seeded here, played as if the lights had been turned out on her side of the court, managing to win just five points.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much you can do when she's playing that well,&quot; said the 17th-ranked South African, who finally got on the scoreboard by holding serve at 0-3 in the second set. &quot;It was pretty tough to be out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Seles has been pretty tough on her next opponent, too: fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez has never taken a set in eight matches against her. The Spaniard advanced with a 7-6 6-0 win over unseeded American Linda Wild.</p>
<p>Seles is not taking anything for granted in the rematch of last year's semifinal.</p>
<p>&quot;For sure she is a tough player,&quot; Seles said of the 1994 Wimbledon champion, who now has reached the semifinals of every Grand Slam this season. &quot;I have to hit a lot of winners. If they're in, great. If they're not, then I'm in trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Martinez was in trouble in the first set when Wild had three set points in the tiebreaker. But the Spaniard won the next five points.</p>
<p>&quot;What was going through my mind was: just keep fighting,&quot; said Martinez of being down 6-3 in the tiebreaker. &quot;If you keep fighting, you can always come back.&quot;</p>
<p>Coetzer might have been thinking the same thoughts, but Seles never gave her a chance to mount a comeback.</p>
<p>&quot;She hardly made any errors,&quot; said Coetzer. &quot;I was just struggling to get into the match.&quot;</p>
<p>The other two semifinal slots were to be decided Wednesday when top seed and defending champion Steffi Graf was to take on unseeded Austrian Judith Wiesner, and 16th-seeded Swiss teen sensation Martina Hingis was to face seventh-seeded Czech Jana Novotna.</p>
