<headline>FOCUS-Eurobourses set records, dollar firms on yen.</headline>

<p>Leading British and German shares climbed to new peaks early on Monday but later retreated, while the dollar set a fresh 33-month high against the yen following Sunday's general election in Japan.</p>
<p>London and Frankfurt bourses scored early records after Friday's sharp rise in New York stocks took the Dow Jones industrial average to its 31st record high of the year. But they failed to make further headway and dropped back by mid-morning.</p>
<p>The Japanese election result effectively weakened the yen by doing little to alter expectations of a continuing easy money policy in Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks slid sharply while government bonds surged to a record high after the poll, which left the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) without a clear majority.</p>
<p>The London Stock Exchange's blue-chip FTSE 100 index hit 4,064.1 in early trading, a rise of 11.0 points to beat its previous best of 4,063.2 set on October 15. Later it dropped back slightly but remained in positive territory.</p>
<p>While it appeared the ninth anniversary of the 1987 &quot;Black Monday&quot; crash was passing off relatively quietly, many still remained nervous that corrections in both the British and U.S. markets were overdue.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing follow-through from Friday and the market's still fairly frothy. Dealers are saying we're going better but don't be too assured about it. There are one or two things lurking in the background,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>German shares also jumped to new record high in pre-bourse electronic trading, boosted by Wall Street and by news that September M3 money supply growth, the Bundesbank's key policy indicator, had slowed down.</p>
<p>The data was in line with market expectations and analysts said the slowdown, while reassuring, would not prompt the German central bank to nudge interest rates lower again in the near term.</p>
<p>The 30-share IBIS DAX index rose 15.91 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,743.47. Its previous peak was 2,739.42, hit on October 18. Later floor trading opened slightly weaker, however, and the DAX index of bourse transactions was down 8.49 points at 2,726.33 by 1045 GMT.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse was less bullish with stocks trading down after a slightly firmer opening. Dealers said the market was being affected by profit-taking after Friday's gains, which saw the bourse close at its highest since May 1994.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 112.79 yen -- just below its 33-month high of 112.86 yen set in early European business. Against the mark it was at 1.5422, off slightly from an early high of 1.5435.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Japanese election result meant it was most likely the government would go ahead with planned sales tax rises in April and modest fiscal tightening would allow the central bank to keep interest rates low.</p>
<p>&quot;The net effect of the polls seems to be that there is really no change at all and a continuation of existing policies will remain yen-negative,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita underlined the current low interest rate policy when he told a meeting of the bank's regional branch managers that monetary policy was aimed at securing a solid base for economic recovery.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1045 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 112.79 yen and 1.5422 marks compared with Friday's London close of 112.59 and 1.5431.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1045 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had risen 6.8 points to 4,059.9.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index dropped 6.97 to 2,178.26.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 8.49 at 2,726.33.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $380.00 an ounce, compared with Friday's $380.15 London close. Silver was down two cents at $4.90.</p>
