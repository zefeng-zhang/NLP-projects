<title>UK: FOCUS-Profit-taking weakens European, U.S. stocks.</title>
<headline>FOCUS-Profit-taking weakens European, U.S. stocks.</headline>

<p>European stocks faded on Tuesday as investors took profits on both sides of the Atlantic and Wall Street came under additional pressure from weak bonds.</p>
<p>Wall Street fell around 0.3 percent in early trading after snapping its record-breaking run on Monday.</p>
<p>The London, Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges had all spent the day in negative territory, with Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index slipping well down from Monday's record close.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchanges the dollar opened higher against the yen in early U.S. trading and looked set to test Monday's 33-month high of 112.90 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the weaker yen trend to continue. It is very difficult to find reasons to buy and hold yen at this time,&quot; said David Durrant, senior currency strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc in New York.</p>
<p>The mark had a brief rally in Europe which dragged the dollar to a low of 1.5285, but subsequent buying by some of the larger banks and funds revived the dollar.</p>
<p>By 1430 GMT the dollar was quoted at 1.5341 marks and 112.87 yen, compared with Monday's London close of 1.5357 marks and 112.72 yen.</p>
<p>News that Tokyo prosecutors had arrested Sumitomo Corp's former top copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, on charges he falsified documents in connection with the largest ever financial scandal had little impact on London metal prices.</p>
<p>The prosecutors' office said Sumitomo had filed formal legal charges against Hamanaka, who it blamed for a massive $2.6 billion loss from unauthorised copper trades.</p>
<p>Precious metals prices extended their gains. Gold fixed in the afternoon at $383.35, its highest level since September 17 and 95 cents above the morning fix.</p>
<p>Europe's equity markets took their early lead from declines on Wall Street overnight and in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Profit-taking pushed British shares back from Monday's record finish. Around an hour after the U.S. market opened, the FTSE 100 share index was down 15 points at 4,057, while the Dow was 17 points adrift.</p>
<p>Traders saw continued interest in telecoms and cable stocks, and firm sterling and government bonds limiting potential falls in London, however.</p>
<p>The market derived most of its strength from the merger of Cable &amp; Wireless's British telecoms operations with cable companies Nynex CableComms and Bell Cablemedia.</p>
<p>Nynex led both percentage gainers and volumes, rising 29.17 percent to 123p with over 40 million shares traded.</p>
<p>German shares closed bourse trade lower, weighed down by the dollar and losses on Wall Street and in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade down 10.05 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,718.98. In later computerised trade the IBIS DAX index was down nearly 8.45 points at 2,725.22.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the index to consolidate for the rest of the week, although they said it was well-supported above the 2,700 point level.</p>
<p>Utility firm RWE AG ended bourse trade down 64 pfennigs at 63.31 marks after reporting a 10 percent increase in group net profits, excluding minority interests, in the year to June.</p>
<p>French stocks were also weighed down by Wall Street's weak start as the bourse continued to digest last week's rally.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1500 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.5350 marks and 112.87 yen, compared with Monday's London close of 1.5357 marks and 112.72 yen .</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 1500 GMT</p>
<p>London - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 15.6 points at 4,057.5.</p>
<p>Paris - The CAC-40 share index was down 4.61 points at 2,175.61.</p>
<p>Frankfurt - The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade down 10.05 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,718.98. In later computerised trade the IBIS DAX index was down nearly 8.45 points at 2,725.22.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $383.35, its highest fixing since September 17 and up from $382.40 in the morning. Silver firmed two cents to $4.96.</p>
