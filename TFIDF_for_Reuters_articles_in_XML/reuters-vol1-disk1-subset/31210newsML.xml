<p>European financial markets digested news of a second U.S. strike against Iraq on Wednesday, with most stocks not holding all the day's gains, gold weaker, and the dollar a little mixed.</p>
<p>Wall Street opened weak and stayed down all through the afternoon, but most European stocks managed to keep ahead.</p>
<p>British shares closed firmer but near the day's lows.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 had been buoyed by New York's reversal from slump to 30-point gain on Tuesday, and took the Dow's opening falls calmy, trading around 20 points ahead, not far from their best 25-point gain. FTSE gainers outweighed decliners by three-and-a-half times.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraqi situation persists but it was last night's turnaround on Wall Street which impacted upon us today,&quot; said one head of UK equity sales.</p>
<p>An agreed 264 million pound ($412.1 million) bid by food distributor Booker for food wholesaler Nurdin &amp; Peacock also helped sentiment, sending the blue chip FTSE 100 index up 25 points at one stage.</p>
<p>Traders said the London market was somewhat subdued because of a monetary meeting between Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George and finance minister Kenneth Clarke, although no announcement was likely to be made on Wednesday.</p>
<p>German shares closed slightly lower in post-bourse electronic trade, with the market eyeing a weaker Wall Street for direction. French stocks finished higher in a technical rebound, helped by strong results at blue-chip energy group Total, brokers said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 13 points, only the second rise in the past eight sessions.</p>
<p>Traders said the bourse appears to be under pressure, with investors are likely to be cautious ahead of the U.S. August non farm payrolls due out on Friday.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar closed little changed against the mark but lost ground against the yen as concerns about rising oil prices in the wake of the U.S. military intervention in Iraq faded, traders said.</p>
<p>Even though tensions continued in Iraq after the second U.S. air strike on Iraqi air defences, the dollar failed to gain fresh support from the situation. Many players expect no major dollar move higher unless the situation escalates.</p>
<p>Dull trading was exacerbated by the market's wait-and-see mode ahead of U.S. jobs data Friday. After that the focus will be on the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in late September.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was 1.4815 marks and 108.80 yen after  1.4837 marks and 109.25 yen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares closed up 16.8 points at 3,872.7.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was 21.16 up at 2,532.37. The electronic IBIS DAX was down 2.55 at 2,526.18.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 13.34 at 1,984.77.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold closed lower at $385.65 vs $386.95 on Tuesday, drifting lower after the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq failed to produce a sustained rally. Silver ended unchanged at $5.18. Platinum finished weaker at $394.4, off $1.85, sliding lower on gold's weakness and seasonal doldrums.</p>
