<p>Irish government bonds slipped back slightly in nervous late trade on Wednesday as the market awaited the release of key economic news and data at home and overseas before the end of this week week, dealers said.</p>
<p>In the UK, the monthly monetary meeting of the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and the governor of the Bank of England Eddie George started at 1400 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Too late to have any real impact on the markets so we will have to wait until the morning for any news,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Thursday sees the release of Irish credit figures with analysts expecting growth to remain strong in July.  </p>
<p>Forecasts for underlying credit growt, range from 13 percent to 13.9 percent compared with 13.3 percent in June.</p>
<p>The stronger-than-expected lending growth in June triggered a tightening of wholesale rates and a subsequent round of retail interest rate rises.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Thursday, the German Bundesbank will meet but no changes in rates are expected.</p>
<p>Friday sees the release of non-farm payrolls data in the U.S. where there has been much speculation regarding a possible rise in interest rates.  </p>
<p>By 1512 GMT, the 8.00 percent bond due 2,000 had eased five pence from Tuesday's close at 103.40 to yield 6.89 percent having been at 103.47 in early trade.</p>
<p>The 8.00 percent bond due 28006 had eased 12p from the close at 102.45 to yield 7.49 percent having been at 102.50 earlier.</p>
<p>Dealers said a 75 million punt tap issue in the 8.0 percent bond due 2006 by Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) had been closed.</p>
<p>&quot;People got all the stock they wanted. It was well supported but not over-subscribed by any means,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
