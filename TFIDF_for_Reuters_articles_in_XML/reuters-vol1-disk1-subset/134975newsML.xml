<p>Austrian shares ended 0.6 percent lower on Tuesday as investors took stock of the ATX index's failure to crack the 1,100 level at the start of the week.</p>
<p>Market participants forecast a period of range trading characterised by low turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;The air is thin around 1,100 points. Today there was very little customer interest and volume dropped significantly,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The ATX index of 21 shares closed 6.11 points down at 1,088.60, with 14 issues down, five up and two unchanged. November ATX futures stood 3.7 points down at 1,092.5.</p>
<p>Traders saw support for the ATX index at around 1,080 points and resistance at 1,095. &quot;The market should hold in a fairly narrow range over the next few days,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Semi-conductor maker Austria Mikro Systeme (AMS) was the biggest decliner, dropping 5.32 percent, or 46 schillings, to 818 schillings.</p>
<p>AMS presents its nine-month results on October 30. The firm posted a pre-tax loss of 3.1 million schillings in the first six months. &quot;Some investors are jittery ahead of the figures,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Fibre maker Lenzing drifted five schillings to 695 as investors absorbed news that the company plans to cut 500 jobs and save up to 600 million schillings annually over the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Engineering group VA Technologie AG was the leading gainer. Its shares closed up 0.74 percent, or 11 schillings, at 1,499 schillings after touching a year-high of 1,510. VA Tech shares have been following an upward channel since early September.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign and domestic investors are keen on VA Tech shares. It was really the only bright spot on today's market,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt shares also ended ahead as market participants sensed the bank's marathon privatisation was entering its closing phase. Ordinary shares added on one schilling to close at 716.5. Preferred gained three schillings to finish at 514.</p>
<p>The broad-based Vienna bourse index slipped 1.76 points to 417.59. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254</p>
