<p>France's conservative government is planning to cut income taxes by between 65 billion and 75 billion francs over the next five years, financial daily Les Echos reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The paper said the gross tax reduction in that period would be about 100 billion francs, but that part of that amount would be recouped by the elimination of some existing tax breaks.</p>
<p>Income tax rates would fall from next year onwards, by five to 10 percent.</p>
<p>In 1997, the income tax cut would come to about 25 billion francs.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Budget Minister Alain Lamassoure refused to confirm the figures in Les Echos but said the tax cuts next year would be at least 20 billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;The scale of tax cuts for 1997 will be at least 20 billion francs,&quot; Lamassoure told Europe 1 radio.</p>
<p>Les Echos said a 20 percent tax allowance would not be extended to dividends and financial revenues. The government had also decided against integrating it into income tax rates, abandoning an idea floated earlier this year.</p>
<p>However, business people holding more than 35 percent of a company would see their tax treatment improved.</p>
<p>The top marginal income tax rate would be cut over the next five years to under 50 percent from 56.8 percent now, Les Echos said. The change would affect 216,000 taxpayers.</p>
<p>A system of allowances for low income and large families would be eliminated over the five-year period and replaced by an unspecified mechanism to help these families. The government hopes the new system will in time exclude more than a million people from paying any income taxes.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports have speculated that the government will replace this &quot;discount&quot; system with a higher threshhold for paying taxes.</p>
<p>The government has decided to progressively eliminate over the next five years tax allowances applicable to more than 100 professions including journalists and pilots.</p>
<p>The allowances now range from five percent to 40 percent.</p>
<p>The paper said the reform could include a move to making maternity benefits taxable.</p>
<p>A 10 percent tax allowance on professional costs for retired people will not be scrapped, nor will allowances on household employees.</p>
<p>The government is also planning to cut the corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 33.3 percent for small and medium-sized companies that reinvest a portion of their profits in their companies. This change would affect 1996 annual profits, the paper said.</p>
