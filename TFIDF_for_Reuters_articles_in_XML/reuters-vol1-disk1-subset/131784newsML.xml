<p>Leading stories in the Greek general press:</p>
<p>TA NEA</p>
<p>-- National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou says the names of major tax evaders will be revealed at the same time as the 1997 budget is brought to Parliament, in interview. Papandoniou says the increase in tax revenues will be based on the abolition of tax breaks and cutbacks on spending. Wage increases will be slightly above inflation and phone tariffs will be the only ones to rise.</p>
<p>--Farmers and family businesses will be the ones to pay the cost of meeting Maastrict criteria, according to research study.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROTYPIA</p>
<p>--The government's incomes policy splits the ruling party PASOK. Leading government members - such as Development Minister Vasso Papandreou, Defence Minister Akis Tsohadzopoulos and Labour Minister Miltiades Papaioannou - want a 'PASOK with a social face' and increases of 10 percent: on the other side are the economic and public administration ministers who are pushing for increases of no more than 4.0.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROS TYPOS</p>
<p>-- Although in theory appointments to the public sector are being frozen - with the entrance examination postponed to the end of 1997 - there are plans for at least 10,000 new appointments. </p>
<p>--Benefits 'massacre': The taxation of all civil servant benefits means a substantial reduction of income. The long hand of the tax department will reach into the pockets of military officials and ministry employees, while large families will also be subject to means-testing.</p>
<p>--The main opposition party New Democracy's new Parliamentary Group secretary calls for cooperation from all for unity while Stephanos Manos, aligned to the 'group of 3' contesting ND president Miltiades Evert's position, says the forthcoming party congress is a &quot;golden opportunity' and reiterates his support for failed leadership contender George Souflias.</p>
<p>ETHNOS</p>
<p>--Taxation indicators for vehicles up by between 20-80 percent. Age provision goes.</p>
<p>-- Defence Minister Akis Tsohadzopoulos says in interviews that he cannot rule out a new 'Imia' but that Greece would  react immediately and decisively in such a case. New weapons will cost over one trillion drachmas and domestic weapons industry will be developed, he says.</p>
