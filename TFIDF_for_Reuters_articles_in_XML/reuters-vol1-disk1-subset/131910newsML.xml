<p>The heads of the three parties in Japan's outgoing coalition government will hold a meeting on Monday afternoon to discuss cooperation after general elections on Sunday, an official of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said.</p>
<p>Secretaries-general of the three parties have agreed that their leaders, including Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is president of the LDP, will meet at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The two other coalition partners are the Social Democratic Party and Sakigake.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's LDP emerged as the biggest winner in Sunday's polls, but its tally of 239 seats was 12 short of the 251 it needed to govern alone in the 500-seat Lower House.</p>
<p>In the outgoing coalition government, the LDP was the dominant partner in an alliance with the Social Democrats and Sakigake, a small LDP splinter group. The LDP said after the poll it would seek to form a new coalition.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't advocate it as low as 125.14. But we should see a 125.58 trade and on a break, sure enough, there's a risk down to 125.36,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Part of the problem for the notionnel is the stubborness of resistance at 126.60, analysts said. That area has stopped the market several times in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;A break above 126.60 would trigger a retest of the 126.80 high,&quot; said analysts at Chase in a note to clients.</p>
<p>&quot;A further break above here would resume the major uptrend, targeting major resistance at the 127.20 level initially, which represents a gap from 1993,&quot; they said.</p>
