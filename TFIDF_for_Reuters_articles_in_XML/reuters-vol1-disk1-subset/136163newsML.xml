<p>Phillips Petroleum Co Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wayne Allen expects lower chemicals margins to continue into next year but said the company overall expects to post solid fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Phillips on Wednesday reported third-quarter net income of $187 million or $0.71 a share, a 38 percent increase over $136 million or $0.52 a share in the same period last year. Revenues rose to $3.9 billion versus $3.4 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I have every reason to expect things are coming our way and we could expect a pretty solid performance in the fourth quarter as well,&quot; Allen said.  </p>
<p>Through the first nine months of the year, Phillips chemicals net operating income was down on lower margins for ethylene, polyethylene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, offset somewhat by improved K-Resin operations and higher ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes, the company said.</p>
<p>Allen said Phillips was experiencing lower margins on ethylene and parazylene seen by most of the industry. &quot;We think that trend will continue in the next few quarters,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Allen said he was not counting on continued high crude oil commodities prices, which pushed the company's average crude price up $4.90 a barrel to $20.54 a barrel in the quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that $25 (a barrel) is something that brings a few smiles to our faces and I think that may be a stretch,&quot; he said, declining to elaborate further on the direction of crude prices.</p>
<p>Phillips broke off talks on forming a domestic refining and marketing venture with DuPont Co's Conoco unit earlier this year, and has no similar talks in progress, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're having no discussions now,&quot; Allen said. &quot;I don't have anything to tell you at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>Phillips refineries were operating flat-out at 100 percent of rated capacity in the quarter, and Allen said that pace could continue. &quot;Don't be surprised as we continue to optimize inside the plant fence that we can do better than 100 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Downstream, Phillips' refining, marketing and transportation third quarter net operating income was down slightly from last year due to lower motor fuel margins offset by higher distillates margins and volumes, the company said.</p>
