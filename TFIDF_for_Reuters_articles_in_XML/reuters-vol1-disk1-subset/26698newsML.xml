<p>British defence and engineering giant General Electric Company has bowed to shareholder anger over a controversial pay package for its new managing director by toughening the contract's performance targets.</p>
<p>The company said Monday it amended the contract, under which George Simpson will now receive a huge block of stock options if GEC's share price exceeds by at least 10 percent the growth in the FTSE 100 index over a three-year period, instead of the six months previously agreed upon.</p>
<p>&quot;GEC and Mr. Simpson have always envisaged that challenging performance criteria would be attached to awards made to Mr. Simpson,&quot; the group said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>Senior company executives met the Association of British Insurers' earlier Monday to try to head off a possible revolt at its annual meeting in four days, amid rising institutional anger that GEC was being too generous to Simpson.</p>
<p>GEC added that Simpson had agreed to the amendment and the criteria complied with ABI guidelines. The terms previously reflected Simpson's arrangements with his employer then.</p>
<p>The Times newspaper said Simpson had sought the addition of stricter performance targets to his contract.</p>
<p>Simpson's three year contract gives him annual pay of up to 1.5 million pounds ($2.35 million), including pension contributions, plus a complicated package of share options.</p>
<p>The former chief executive of Lucas Industries, who takes over at GEC from Lord Weinstock, has already been dubbed &quot;the fattest cat of all&quot; by British newspapers.</p>
<p>His controversial deal has turned up the heat in the debate about top executives' pay, sparked last year when former British Gas Chief Executive Cedric Brown was awarded a 75 percent raise.</p>
<p>Mounting public anger over &quot;fat cat&quot; salaries prompted the government to set up a committee to curb boardroom excesses. But despite guidelines set by the committee, led by Marks &amp; Spencer Chairman Sir Richard Greenbury, executive salaries are rising.</p>
