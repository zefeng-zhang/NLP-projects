<p>Briton Tim Henman achieved another milestone for his country at the U.S. Open on Sunday.</p>
<p>After becoming his country's first Wimbledon quarterfinalist in 23 years earlier this year, the unseeded Henman became the first Englishman to reach the fourth round at the Open since 1984 by upsetting 12th-seeded Todd Martin 6-2 7-6 6-4.</p>
<p>The last Englishman to get this far was John Lloyd, who watched from courtside at the National Tennis Centre stadium.</p>
<p>Henman's one hour, 49 minute victory under the stadium lights was particularly sweet for the 22-year-old since it was the lanky American who had stopped his Wimbledon run with a three-set victory.</p>
<p>&quot;It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to put the past behind me and come up with a win,&quot; said Henman, ranked 39th in the world. &quot;It's very special, this was one of the biggest and best matches in my career.&quot;</p>
<p>Martin, who in the Wimbledon semifinals went on to lose to countryman Mal Washington after leading 5-1 in the fifth set, agreed with Henman's assessment.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I played Tim on one of his best nights,&quot; said Martin.</p>
<p>Henman's victory sets up a match with the tournament's sentimental favourite Stefan Edberg, who is retiring at the end of this year and is playing his last Open.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm delighted have the opportunity,&quot; Henman said of playing Edberg, with whom he has practised frequently in London where the 30-year-old Swede has a home.</p>
<p>But Henman promised not to lose focus of the task at hand when he plays the six-time Grand Slam champion.</p>
<p>&quot;The last thing you have to do is to look up and see that you are playing one of the real greats,&quot; said Henman.</p>
<p>Martin played with his right elbow heavily wrapped after hyper-extending it during his first-round win over Younes El Aynoui, but refused to use it as the reason for his demise.</p>
<p>&quot;My elbow felt fine, the only problem out there today was that I wasn't copmfortable playing without a real good serve against a guy who was very aggressive,&quot; said Martin, who collected just seven aces.</p>
<p>Martin threatened in the second set when he had two set points on Henman's serve at 5-4. Henman fought his way into a tiebreaker where he took a a 5-4 lead by swatting a forehand return winner.</p>
<p>Henman then raised the voltage on his serve, taking the next two points and the set with a pair of booming service winners.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a point where you have to say that's a little too good,&quot; Martin said.</p>
