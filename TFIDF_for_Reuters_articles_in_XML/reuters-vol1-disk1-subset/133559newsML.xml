<title>MALAYSIA: KL shares end higher with secondaries in lead.</title>
<headline>KL shares end higher with secondaries in lead.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The surge of secondary stocks led the Kuala Lumpur market to a higher finish, with blue chips lifted by late-afternoon buying.</p>
<p>Dealers said secondaries were the main focus as many second board counters hit new highs for the year.</p>
<p>The Second Board index ended at 625.10 points, up 7.58 points or 1.23 percent despite the sharp fall of Repco Holdings. &quot;People say the next target is 650. It's not very difficult to push the small-cap second boards,&quot; said a Mayban Securities trader. The blue-chip focused Composite Index was up 1.97 points to 1,175.98.  </p>
<p>Second boarders Dataprep, Fourseason, Esprit, Poly Glass and Tamadam rose to intraday highs for the year.</p>
<p>Repco fell 5.50 ringgit or 6.4 percent to 80.50. Its chief executive officer was charged with violating a securities law. He pleaded not guilty to the accusation of making a misleading statement.</p>
<p>Weak blue chips were saved by afternoon buying led by foreign institutions, GK Goh Stockbrokers said in its market report.</p>
<p>Proton, expected to post strong half-year earnings, rose 30 cents to 15.30.</p>
