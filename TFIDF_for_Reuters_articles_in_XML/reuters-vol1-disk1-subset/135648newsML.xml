<p>South African advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Klerck &amp; Barrett (SSKB) said Cordiant Plc's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide had taken a 51 percent stake in the concern for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>SSKB chairman Jurie Snyman said on Tuesday the acquisition by the British group was a vote of confidence in the firm, which is South Africa's seventh largest agency in terms of billings.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows confidence in the South Africa market and in this company's performance,&quot; he told Reuters, adding the agency had registered annual growth in business ranging between 23 and 30 percent in the past three years.</p>
<p>A further attraction was the network of agencies built by SSKB in 16 sub-Saharan countries, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the multinationals returning to South Africa it is very nice for the guys in the Worldwide network to be able to offer one-stop shopping in Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa's advertising spending last year totalled around 4.55 billion rand.</p>
