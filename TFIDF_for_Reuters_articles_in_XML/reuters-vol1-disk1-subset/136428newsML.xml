<p>Russia's foreign minister responded coolly on Wednesday to U.S. President Bill Clinton's commitment to try to bring some former communist states into NATO by 1999, but said he would await further developments.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to make a specific comment. All I can do is to repeat our general position that we have a negative attitude to the plans for expanding NATO,&quot; Yevgeny Primakov told reporters in Russia's first official comment on the announcement made by Clinton on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Primakov, speaking after talks in Moscow with Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani, was pressed for more details but added only: &quot;Let's wait and see&quot;.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has consistently opposed the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to include its former communist-era allies in eastern Europe, saying the idea risks creating new lines of division.</p>
<p>Clinton said in a speech in Detroit that he wanted the Western alliance to admit new members by 1999, publicly backing a target date for the first time.</p>
<p>In a clear message to Russia, Clinton said in his speech that no country outside NATO would have a veto over any other state becoming a member.</p>
<p>He did not say which countries he wanted to join the alliance first, but the conventional wisdom among members is that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic head the queue.</p>
<p>NATO ministers are to meet in December to pave the way for an alliance summit in 1997 that would name the first candidates for membership and lead to the start of negotiations.</p>
<p>Ousted Russian security chief Alexander Lebed, sacked last for insubordination, said he did not think Clinton's comments would fuel tensions between Moscow and Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;(Clinton's comments) are just a pre-election statement, a kind of pre-election posturing,&quot; he said on Tuesday. The U.S. presidential election will take place next month.</p>
<p>Lebed, a stern critic of NATO's expansion plans, was hailed by NATO officials during his visit to Brussels earlier this month as a man they could do business with.</p>
