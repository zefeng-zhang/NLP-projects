<p>A lawyer for U.S. investors who blocked the reorganization plan of insurance market Lloyd's of London said on Sunday Lloyd's has asked an appeals court to overturn the lower court's ruling thwarting its financial recovery.</p>
<p>The motion to stay was expected as Lloyd's was preparing to exhaust all measures to proceed with its scheduled Aug. 28 vote on the reorganization plan.</p>
<p>Susan Cahoon, one of the lawyers representing investors, told Reuters that Lloyd's had filed a 52-page motion for a panel of appeals judges to consider on Tuesday, a day before the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We just received by fax a motion asking the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the preliminary injunction -- don't make Lloyd's comply while the 4th Circuit takes up the issue,&quot; Cahoon said in a telephone interview from her Atlanta law firm.</p>
<p>On Friday, a U.S. federal judge in Richmond, Va. issued a preliminary injunction rendering Lloyd's &quot;reconstruction and renewal&quot; plan doubtful. Shortly afterwards a lawyer for the venerable institution said an appeal had already been filed.</p>
<p>The plan called for investors to fund a newly formed reinsurance company, Equitas. But, already near financial ruin from existing Lloyd's investments, they were sceptical, claiming Lloyd's had not supplied them with sufficient information about Equitas and thus breached U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Payne of the U.S. District Court for Eastern Virginia concurred and ordered Lloyd's to comply within a month.</p>
<p>He ruled the 93 U.S. investors in the case would suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction was denied. He said the purpose of the order was to protect Americans, the Lloyd's offer and Aug. 28 deadline to vote on it.</p>
<p>The request for an emergency stay, according to Cahoon, &quot;recounts many of the same arguments that Lloyd's made to the lower court: an English choice of laws question on are these or aren't these securities? It cites the dire consequences for Lloyds, and says that the deadlines are fixed and immutable.&quot;</p>
<p>She said a response would be filed to the judges on behalf of the plaintiffs, asking the appeals court to deny the motion.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lloyd's were not available for comment.</p>
<p>In Friday's order, Judge Payne also ruled &quot;requiring Lloyd's to comply with its obligations under the U.S. securities laws would serve the public interest in full disclosure.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors, whom Lloyd's calls Names -- individuals who pledge their assets to back the insurance policies sold at Lloyd's -- were being asked to pay up to $150,000 each to help fund Equitas, which would take responsibility for $12.4 billion in losses from asbestos, pollution, and disaster claims between 1988-92.</p>
<p>Lloyd's is known for exotic, if sometimes risky, insurance policies as well as paying them in a timely manner throughout its 308-year-old history. It reportedly insured the Titanic, paid out claims for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, covered Hitler's private Junkers airplane, and underwrote the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge before hitting hard times.</p>
<p>The ruling effectively blocks creation of Equitas, and Lloyd's has been given until Sept. 23, 1996 to see that American Names receive information on Equitas.</p>
<p>There are 2,700 U.S. Names and 33,500 worldwide.</p>
<p>Moreover, investors already leaning toward supporting the recovery plan can pay into an escrow account (in lieu of Equitas) set up by the court by Sept. 30. They then have until Oct. 30 to review the information and tell Lloyd's whether they accept the offer.</p>
<p>If they accept, their funds will be released from the escrow account to Lloyd's; but if they reject the offer, their funds stay in escrow until the recovery plan is finalised.</p>
<p>A trial date has already been set for Nov. 4, and that may not be the last of Lloyd's U.S. legal woes.</p>
<p>Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton has told Lloyd's he is working on a new claim against the market on behalf of Names in that state.</p>
