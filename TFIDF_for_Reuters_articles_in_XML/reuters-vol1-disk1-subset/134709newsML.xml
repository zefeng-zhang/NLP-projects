<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shekel rises against dollar, basket.</title>

<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Israeli shekel rose sharply against the dollar and the basket of foreign currencies in trading made volatile and nervous over the direction of interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very nervous and trading was very volatile today. The dollar fell from 3.27 shekels to 3.23 shekels. Later the dollar recovered slightly and rose to 3.24 shekels,&quot; said a dealer at Bank Hapoalim.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week investors were expecting a rate cut of one percentage point but now the market expects a cut of only 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the next few days but the market will continue to show nervousness until Monday (when the central bank will announce interest rates for November),&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The central bank's key lending rate is now at an annual 15.5 percent.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.2460 against 3.2700 on Monday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, closed at 3.6251 shekels against 3.6479 on Monday.</p>
<p>On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.8756 shekels per 100 yen against 2.8975 on Monday and against the mark at 2.1171 shekels against 2.1263 on Monday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.2450 shekels.</p>
