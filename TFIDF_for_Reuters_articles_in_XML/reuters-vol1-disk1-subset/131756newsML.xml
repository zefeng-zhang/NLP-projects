<p>The outlook for property in Shanghai's Pudong area, long the object of foreign investor scepticism, is suddenly looking up with increasing interest from firms in moving there, analysts and businessmen said on Monday.</p>
<p>A real estate analyst said foreign companies were looking anew at moving to the business district in Pudong, across the river from the current business centre of Shanghai, the focal point of which is the famous waterfront Bund.</p>
<p>A foreign banker said he felt that Pudong, with its largely empty buildings and low rents, was like a vacuum sucking in companies from the established areas of the city.</p>
<p>&quot;Pudong is looking much better, there's a growing trickle of people moving over there now,&quot; said a manager with a foreign real estate firm based in Shanghai. &quot;It looks like it might turn round faster than we expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, many people were predicting at least a five-year time-scale for Pudong to realise the high hopes of the city government and the leadership in Beijing.</p>
<p>Analysts said it now looked likely to realise a good part of its potential before that.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to be sceptical, but I now think Pudong will be a success. It's a vacuum of space that will pull people in,&quot; said the foreign banker.</p>
<p>&quot;It's becoming a matter of how can you avoid it. At 80 (U.S.) cents per square metre per day for prime office space (compared to $2-$3 in western Shanghai), how can you say no?&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A manager with a Pudong real estate company said sales were going well for offices and residential property.</p>
<p>&quot;There are three reasons: the recent cuts in interest rates, the start of many basic infrastructure projects such as the subway and the airport, and the supportive policies from the government towards real estate,&quot; the manager said.</p>
<p>Work started recently on a subway line linking Pudong with central Shanghai, and on Pudong airport, which is expected to become Shanghai's main international airport in the early years of the next century.</p>
<p>An analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai said he was now predicting 50-60 per cent occupancy for office space in Lujiazui, the business centre of Pudong, by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The infrastructure is now basically there. If you go to Pudong, you can see the traffic volume is building up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A big jump in office occupancy and prospects for Pudong would come when the financial exchanges began to move to new buildings there by the middle of 1997, he said.</p>
<p>The stock exchange and the grain market will move to Lujiazui area next year and the metals and commodity exchange before the end of this century.</p>
<p>He said the turnaround could have a positive impact on the share price of Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Zone Development Co Ltd, the company developing the lion's share of the Pudong business district.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, Lujiazui is a bit over-priced, but we're not advising people to sell. It could become hot overnight, for instance when the government announces foreign banks can do renminbi business,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the basic factor concerning Pudong property was the high level of support for the zone from senior Chinese leaders, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji.</p>
<p>&quot;If Pudong property fell too much, it would reflect too badly on those two powerful guys,&quot; he said.</p>
