<title>USA: Lockheed sees restructuring savings.</title>
<headline>Lockheed sees restructuring savings.</headline>
<dateline>SAN ANTONIO, Texas 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Lockheed Martin Corp said on Tuesday it expected restructuring savings of $2.5 billion a year post-1999, partly due to U.S. government policy of sharing defense consolidation costs with contractors.</p>
<p>The company also said its backlog in the third quarter fell to $49.1 billion compared with $50.1 billion in the second quarter, largely due to the government fiscal year ending on September 30.  </p>
<p>Lockheed said in the third quarter, the U.S. Congress reaffirmed policy providing for the government and its contractors to share in costs and savings associated with the consolidation of the U.S. defense industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy is generating considerable savings every year -- $500 million in the first year of Lockheed Martin's consolidation plan alone,&quot; Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Norman Augustine said.</p>
<p>He said when Lockheed Martin finished restructuring for mergers and acquisitions, the anticipated annual savings would be about $2.5 billion after 1999.  </p>
<p>Augustine said the company's favorable sales comparisons were due, for the most part, to the strategic combination with Loral Corp's defense electronics and systems integration businesses.</p>
<p>Lockheed reported third quarter 1996 sales of $7.03 billion compared with $5.55 billion in the same period last year. The company also said its profit margins increased in the quarter due to strong operating and financial performance, cost reductions and efficiency improvements.  </p>
<p>The company also said it had strong cash flow during the quarter, and generated nearly $700 million in free cash year to date.</p>
