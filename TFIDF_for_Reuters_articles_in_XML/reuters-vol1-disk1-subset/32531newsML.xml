<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Telepar upgraded, Telemig downgraded.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Banco Patrimonio, a local associate of Salomon Brothers, said it is upgrading Brazilian telecoms firm Telepar's preferred share but downgraded sister firm Telemig's preferred B share.</p>
<p>-- In a report on Brazil's telecoms sector, the bank also said it is maintaining its buy recommendations on Telesp and Telemig common and its hold rating on Telerj's preferred.  </p>
<p>-- The report on local operators analyzed first-half results and revised the bank's forecasts for Telemig, Telepar, Telerj and Telesp.</p>
<p>-- It cited as positive factors current tariffs, expansion of cellular lines and higher usage, especially long distance,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>-- &quot;We believe that these favorable fundamentals equally benefit all of the above-mentioned operators,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>-- The report analyzed magnitude of potential demand, traffic growth, sales mix and efficiency and profitability in studying the firms.</p>
<p>-- Telesp serves Sao Paulo state, Telerj provides service to Rio de Janerio state, Telemig serves Minas Gerais state and Telepar provides service to Parana state.</p>
<p>-- In reiterating its buy recommendation on Telesp, the bank said the firm is Brazil's number one-ranked operating company, adding it &quot;deserves to trade at a premium locally and within Latin America mainly because of its compelling line growth.&quot;</p>
<p>-- It said it favors common, or ordinary shares of Telesp over its preferred.</p>
<p>-- The bank raised its earnings estimate for Telesp to $729 million from $649.6 million for 1996 and to $935.1 million from $909.2 million for 1997.</p>
<p>-- Patrimonio also said Telepar preferred trades at a discount to both Telemig preferred B and Telesp common and preferred shares.</p>
<p>-- It said it was increasing its 1996 earnings forecast for Telepar to $115 million from $99.9 million and its 1997 estimate to $183.6 million from $130.1 million.</p>
<p>-- The bank said Telemig's preferred B share trades at price-to-cash-earnings discount of only four percent compared with Telesp preferred.</p>
<p>-- Patrimonio also said it raised 1996 earnings estimates for Telemig to $219.5 million from $186.2 million and 1997 estimates to $335.6 million from $258.5 million.</p>
<p>-- The bank also said it increased its earnings estimate for Telerj for 1996 to $161.6 million from $90 million and for 1997 to $326.4 million from $166 million.</p>
