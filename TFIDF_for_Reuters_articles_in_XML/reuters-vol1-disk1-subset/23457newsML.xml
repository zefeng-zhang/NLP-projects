<title>USA: ValuJet to offer passengers promotional fares.</title>
<headline>ValuJet to offer passengers promotional fares.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-08-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>ValuJet Inc.'s stock rose Friday after federal authorities returned its operating certificate and its president said the airline would offer special lower fares to win back passengers.</p>
<p>Stock in the low-cost airline gained $1.50, or about 14 percent, to $12.50 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, President Lewis Jordan said the airline, which was grounded after a crash in May that cost 110 lives, would offer special low fares to attract customers after federal authorities give its planes permission to fly again.</p>
<p>Jordan said in television interviews that the airline would continue to be a low-priced carrier and would offer the same &quot;affordable&quot; fares despite the cost of compliance with Federal Aviation Administration requirements imposed to permit it to resume operations.</p>
<p>Jordan estimated it could be two or three weeks -- or longer if aviation agency officials have more questions -- before the airline could resume service.</p>
<p>The company cannot advertise or take reservations until it has final approval from the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>As a result of the government's extensive review, Jordan said, the airline would rely on only two outside contractors for heavy maintenance and had revised its training programmes and maintenance manuals and hired a senior vice president for maintenance.</p>
<p>He said the Department of Transportation reviewed the airline's balance sheet and determined it was financially strong enough to return to service.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a lot of money in the bank,&quot; he said. &quot;We will pass along the same affordable fares that the public wants. We have over $200 million in cash. Even if we spend $50 million on the shutdown, that leaves us with a lot of cash.&quot;</p>
<p>Atlanta-based ValuJet was grounded June 17 after a heightened safety inspection of the carrier following the deadly May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades.</p>
<p>The FAA said on Thursday it had returned the carrier's operating certificate after a review found it had corrected maintenance and operation failings that led to the grounding.</p>
<p>After a period for government review of any response to the proposed approval, the airline could fly nine planes at first and up to 15 over the next several days. Before it was grounded, ValuJet flew 51 aircraft.</p>
<p>The shutdown and the cost of changes instituted at the airline will be a one-time charge against expenses, Jordan said.</p>
