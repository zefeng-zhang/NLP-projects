<p>World number one Pete Sampras enjoyed what he described as `a dream day' on Friday, taking just under an hour to crush Andre Agassi in their quarter-final clash at the Stuttgart Open.</p>
<p>The three-times Wimbledon champion played some superb tennis on his way to a 6-4 6-1 victory in 57 minutes and afterwards rated the performance as one of his best ever.</p>
<p>&quot;These are days you dream about,&quot; the 25-year-old American said. &quot;I was in a zone...everything I tried, it just clicked. I could not have played any better.&quot;</p>
<p>Sampras and the 26-year-old Agassi have clashed in three major grand slam finals -- the last in 1995 when Sampras won the U.S. Open in four sets.</p>
<p>Friday's match, however, was no classic. Agassi, who needs some good results in the next few weeks to make sure of his place at next month's season-ending world championship, was far from his best.</p>
<p>The Las Vegan, ranked ninth in the world, hit some brilliant returns but was not consistent enough to challenge the sport's best player.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still amazed the way Andre can return serve,&quot; Sampras said. &quot;But it was tough to beat me today...this was among the top five matches in my career as far as being in a great rhythm is concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never returned like that before. Playing Agassi forces you to do things like that.&quot;</p>
<p>After the two Americans held their opening service games, the first set witnessed an extraordinary seven breaks of serve in eight games.</p>
<p>But Sampras kept his nerve, clinching the first set after 36 minutes when Agassi hit a forehand out.</p>
<p>Agassi never fully recovered his composure as Sampras ran away to a 5-0 lead in the second set on his way to victory.</p>
<p>In Saturday's semifinals Sampras will meet Dutchman Jan Siemerink who beat Croatian fifth seed Goran Ivanisevic 6-3 7-6 in the first quarter-final of the day.</p>
