<p>Kaiser Aluminum Corp. said Friday it was evaluating its options after the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision blocking its plan to create a second class of common stock.</p>
<p>Kaiser, one of the world's leading producers of aluminum, said it was disappointed by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision late Thursday upholding a preliminary injunction issued by the Delaware Court of Chancery April 10 against the plan's implementation.</p>
<p>The chancery court found that the existing conversion rights of preferred stockholders could not be adjusted as proposed without the consent of the preferred holders.</p>
<p>Kaiser had proposed issuing Class A common stock with one vote per share and another class of common stock with 1/10th of a vote per share.</p>
<p>The company said its common stock holders had approved the proposal but some holders of its convertible preferred stock had objected to the plan and sought to block it in court.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs alleged in their lawsuit that the stock reclassification plan was an attempt by management to create an unfair advantage for Kaiser's majority shareholder, Maxxam Corp. Maxxam owns about 62 percent of Kaiser's common stock but none of its preferred shares.</p>
<p>Kaiser's common stock gained 12.5 cents to $12.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
