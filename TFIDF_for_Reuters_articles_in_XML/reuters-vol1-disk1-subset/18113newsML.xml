<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Leading UK blue chips finished at another record peak, buoyed by a better performance on Wall Street, a successful gilts auction, and renewed bid speculation.</p>
<p>Several waves of index-arbitrage related buying provided additional support and helped bolster otherwise thin volume. The FTSE 100 index closed 13.0 points higher at 3,918.7.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Profit-taking chipped away at German share market gains in calm floor trading but the blue-chip DAX index still closed the session with gains, underpinned by several shares' strong performances. The 30-share DAX index closed up 4.32 points at 2,563.16. In post-bourse trade the IBIS DAX index stood at 2,556.64.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares finished easier but clung stubbornly above the psychologically important 2,000 level on the CAC-40 index, despite London surging to new highs and Wall Street advancing, traders said Paris was mired in gloom over franc fragility, poor corporate earnings outlook and low expectations for the 1997 budget and tax reforms. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 15.09 points or 0.75 percent to 2,002.90.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Firmer U.S. bonds helped Swiss shares recover from a fall in the early afternoon, triggered by a slump in the dollar, but the market still finished below Tuesday's close, disappointment with the half-year figures of the three Swiss pharmaceuticals companies and Alusuisse had put shares under pressure from the start, but strong gains in Swiss Re lent some support to the market. The All-share Swiss Performance Index fell 12.40 points or 0.52 percent to 2,368.07.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended near their lowest level for the day, as concerns over the Japanese economy grew after the Bank of Japan's quarterly &quot;tankan&quot; survey of corporations for August showed unexpectedly weaker business sentiment. The key Nikkei 225 average ended down 200.46 points or 0.96 percent at 20,709.81.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks ended firmer as late buying of market laggards erased earlier losses. The Hang Seng index closed 40.56 points higher at 11,379.49.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market closed higher with buying picking up pace in the afternoon as local bonds took heart from Japanese economic data that eased concerns about a possible interest rate tightening there. The All Ordinaries index rose 21.9 points to close at 2,284.2.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African all-share and industrial indices finished strong after solid trade, riding a wave, composed of positive sentiment after Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals' comments on Tuesday and a healthy rand, and driven by robust futures trade. The Overall index finished up 63.6 points at 6,679.7, Industrials were up 38.4 points to 7,837.9 and Golds added 1.2 to 1,786.9.</p>
