<p>Russia's world number four Yevgeny Kafelnikov crashed out of the Stuttgart Open in his opening match on Tuesday after losing his nerve in a late-night clash with Dutchman Jan Siemerink.</p>
<p>After leading 4-1 in the decisive third set and then 5-1 later in the tiebreak of a second-round encounter, the Russian gave away the match just before midnight. The scoreline was 3-6 6-3 7-6.</p>
<p>Siemerink took the tiebreak 7-5 to cause the first major shock of the indoor tournament which has brought together most of the top 20 players in the world.</p>
<p>Earlier Richard Krajicek and Michael Chang has used their heads as much as their hands to win their second round matches.</p>
<p>After losing the first set of a routine opening match against Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch, Wimbledon champion Krajicek cast his mind back to London grass in July and the biggest win of his career.</p>
<p>&quot;Being the Wimbledon champion helps me be more relaxed,&quot; Krajicek said. &quot;Sometimes when I am not playing so well I try to remind myself that I am the Wimbledom champion and it helps me to relax.</p>
<p>&quot;Even today when I did not feel so good in the first set it helped me to raise my game.&quot;</p>
<p>The number eight seed was soon on his way to a 4-6 6-3 6-2 victory at the prestigious indoor event which has attracted most of the world's top 30 players.</p>
<p>Chang later defeated Australian Todd Woodbridge 6-3 6-2 to join the Dutchman in the third round.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good first match for me. I had to do a lot of thinking out there,&quot; Chang said.</p>
<p>Krajicek, given a royal award and a hero's reception in the Netherlands after Wimbledon, concedes that apart from his first grand slam success he has not had a very successful year.</p>
<p>The world number seven needs to play well in Stuttgart to qualify for next month's world championships in Hanover, the season-ending event formerly known as the Masters.</p>
<p>He has recovered from a knee injury which forced him to retire from a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand last month and his strong serve-and-volley game should suit the fast indoor Stuttgart surface.</p>
<p>Chang now faces former Australian and French Open winner Jim Courier who returned to action after a two-month injury break with a confidence-boosting 7-6 6-4 victory over Czech Bohdan Ulihrach.</p>
<p>Courier was playing his first competitive match since the middle of August when he picked up a knee injury but came through Tuesday's test without any pain.</p>
<p>Wednesday should be a fascinating day at the high-class event when the biggest names in the sport appear in the second round.</p>
<p>World number one Pete Sampras takes on Armenian Sargis Sargsian who beat Australian Mark Philippoussis 7-5 6-3 in his first-round match on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker takes on Britain's big-serving Greg Rusedski who defeated Spaniard Carlos Moya 6-3 6-4 in the first round.</p>
