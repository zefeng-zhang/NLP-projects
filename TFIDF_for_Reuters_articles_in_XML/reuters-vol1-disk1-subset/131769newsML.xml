<p>A monthly survey by the Samar agency, which monitors the domestic car market, showed 289,474 new units were registered in January-September, compared with 210,088 in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Samar, quoting figures by the Journal of the Global Industry, said Poland led other European countries regarding new cars registration growth rate.</p>
<p>It said Poland was followed by Norway and Ireland, where cars registration growth reached 34.6 percent and 30.7 percent over the period with 95,800 and 106,100 units sold respectively.</p>
<p>Germany, ranking the first in the new car sales volume, registered 2,717,700 units in the January-September period, 8.5 percent more than last year.</p>
<p>In Poland, the domestic unit of Fiat Spa led the market with 104,097 cars and a 43.6 percent market share.</p>
<p>Other top sellers include Daewoo-FSO, a unit of South Korea's Daewoo Corp , General Motors' German unit Adam Opel AG and Czech Skoda .</p>
<p>Samar Director Wojciech Drzewiecki earlier said the robust cars sales was fuelled by growth in real wages and more attractive terms of bank financing of car purchases.</p>
