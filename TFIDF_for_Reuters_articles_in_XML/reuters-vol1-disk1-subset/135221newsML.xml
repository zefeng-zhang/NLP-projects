<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met China's leaders on Tuesday, the climax of a fence-mending trip delayed because of a diplomatic dispute over Tibet.</p>
<p>Kinkel met Communist Party leader and State President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng at the Zhongnanhai compound, residence and workplace of some of China's leaders in central Beijing, German officials travelling with Kinkel said.</p>
<p>Details of their talks were not immediately known. Kinkel was to hold a news conference later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kinkel met his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, on Monday and told reporters that there were bumps in Sino-German relations, but that they were now resolved.</p>
<p>Qian had accepted an invitation to visit Germany in early 1997 and German President Roman Herzog would pay a state visit to China from November 18 to 25.</p>
<p>Kinkel, who arrived on Monday for a five-day visit, said he and Qian also discussed human rights, specifically the cases of Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng.</p>
<p>Kinkel said Wang's family had appealed for him to raise the case of the former student leader, currently awaiting trial on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Wang, a leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing that were crushed by the army, was expected to be tried in secret, family members said. He had previously spent four years in jail for his role in the 1989 protests.</p>
<p>Kinkel gave no details of the content of his discussions on Wang or Wei Jingsheng, a veteran dissident sentenced to 14 years in prison last December for plotting to subvert the government.</p>
<p>Wei, known as the father of China's struggling pro-democracy movement and a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, was jailed for 15 years in 1979 and had been parolled for less than a year before his re-arrest in April 1994.</p>
<p>German opposition politicians have long been critical of Kinkel's policy towards China, accusing him of treading too softly on human rights issues for the sake of securing large industrial orders for German companies.</p>
<p>Kinkel had originally planned to visit in July, but Beijing withdrew its invitation after the German lower house of parliament passed a resolution accusing China of trying to eradicate Tibet's cultural identity.</p>
<p>The dispute briefly threatened to affect China's economic ties with Germany, Beijing's largest European trade partner.</p>
<p>After talks in September on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly meeting in New York, Kinkel and Qian said they had cleared up outstanding problems and the German foreign minister's invitation was renewed.</p>
<p>About two dozen representatives from German industry, many of them from companies specialising in environmental protection technology, are accompanying the foreign minister.</p>
