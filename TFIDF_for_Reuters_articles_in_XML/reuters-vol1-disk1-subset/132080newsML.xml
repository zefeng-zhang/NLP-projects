<title>CHINA: Germany's Kinkel in China on long-delayed visit.</title>
<headline>Germany's Kinkel in China on long-delayed visit.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel arrived in Beijing on Monday for a long-delayed visit to put bilateral ties back on track after a row over Tibet.</p>
<p>Kinkel would meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen later on Monday, said a spokesman for the German embassy in Beijing.</p>
<p>During his five-day stay, Kinkel would also meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng and inaugurate a new German embassy building.</p>
<p>Kinkel had originally planned a visit in July but Beijing withdrew its invitation after the German lower house of parliament passed a resolution accusing China of trying to eradicate Tibet's cultural identity.</p>
<p>After talks on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly meeting in New York in September, Kinkel and Qian said they had cleared up outstanding problems between China and its biggest European trade partner. Kinkel's invitation was then renewed.</p>
<p>Talks between Kinkel and Qian were expected to focus on likely areas of future cooperation, including environmental policy, and preparation for a state visit by President Roman Herzog scheduled for next month.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if Kinkel would raise human rights issues in his meetings with Chinese officials.</p>
<p>Chinese dissident and former student leader Wang Dan has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government and could face a death sentence if convicted.</p>
<p>German opposition politicians have long been critical of Kinkel's policy towards China, accusing him of treading too softly on human rights issues for the sake of securing large industrial orders for German companies.</p>
<p>A delegation of about 20 representatives from German industry, many of them from companies specialising in environmental protection technology, are expected to accompany the foreign minister.</p>
<p>German officials have said environmental policy was expected to be one of the main themes of the visit, with Kinkel opening a joint German-Chinese workshop on environmental issues on Monday.</p>
<p>As one of the world's leading exporters of environmental technology after the United States, Bonn is hoping German firms can cash in on the need for environmental protection measures in China's rapidly-growing economy.</p>
