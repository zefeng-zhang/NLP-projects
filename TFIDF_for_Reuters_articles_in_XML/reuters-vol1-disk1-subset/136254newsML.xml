<p>London white sugar futures ended hardly changed to just easier on Wednesday in a dull market.</p>
<p>Many participants were away at an industry gathering sponsored by the International Sugar Organization (ISO). Traders said late buying on the dips helped support prices and retrieve them from day's lows at $315.80 a tonne for December. It last traded down 90 cents at $316.00.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said a move below $315.00 would see the market falling the next support at $310.</p>
<p>Traders confirmed Libya has bought two cargoes of 45 ICUMSA white sugar for December shipment. Earlier, there was talk that Libya could have booked up to four cargoes, one for November delivery and three for December. Elsewhere, news Brazil has approved a final tranche of 1.04 million tonnes of tax-free sugar exports from the 5.2 million export limit was within trade expectation and had no impact.</p>
<p>The market has so far ignored news of damage to the Cuban sugar cane crop following a hurricane after Havana said the island still aimed to improve on last year's 4.45 million tonnes.</p>
