<p>Greece's crucial 1997 budget will concentrate on raising tax revenues by cuts in tax exemptions and intensifying the fight against tax evasion, National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in tax revenues will be based on two axes: the first is the abolition of tax exemptions and the second is the intensification of checks against tax evasion,&quot; he told Athens daily 'Ta Nea'.</p>
<p>The names of major tax evaders will be revealed to the public at the same time as the budget, he said, in an effort to convince the public that tax evasion is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;Greek society has to comprehend that the government is not afraid,&quot; he said. The special tax crimes squad will &quot;be more active in prosecuting major economic crimes, major tax evasion by high income and high-profile earners.&quot;</p>
<p>Papandoniou said there would be no increases in taxes on fuel and beverages but that there would be &quot;an automatic tax adjustment&quot; on cigarettes.</p>
<p>He said, however, that the government would revise pricing practices on fuel, and may consider establishing a competition committee to check excessive profits by fuel trading firms.</p>
<p>&quot;We will revise the pricing of petrol products, because we have entered a period of high international petrol prices which is dangerous for international economic balances and for inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to look at how the Public Petroleum Company (DEP) prices petrol and other products, because I have a feeling this is inflationary,&quot; he told Ta Nea.</p>
