<p>Another two Moslem refugee houses were destroyed in explosions in Serb territory of north-east Bosnia in a bombing campaign NATO has tried in vain to halt, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We were informed at 1545 (1345 GMT) of another two houses blown up in the region of Koraj,&quot; Andrea Angelli, spokesman for the U.N. police said.</p>
<p>The village of Koraj lies in the north-eastern area of Serb territory in Bosnia called Sapna where Moslem refugees are returning to rebuild their damaged houses and where most of some 70 explosions have occured since the beginning of October.</p>
<p>Angelli could not say if the houses belonged to Moslems.</p>
<p>In an attempt to put an end to the campaign aimed to discourage Moslems from resettling in their old homes, NATO said on Tuesday it would step up patrols in the high-risk areas.</p>
<p>&quot;We have started an operation to prevent and to apprehend perpetrators of these bombings,&quot; NATO spokesman Major Simon Haselock said but added he was not informed about the latest explosions.</p>
<p>&quot;These operations are in early days, but we condemn unequivocally any such incident and we are determined to stop any further bombings.&quot;</p>
<p>In a separate incident, two Italian nationals travelling through Serb territory in northern Bosnia had their car stolen in an area notorious for hijackings, Angelli said.</p>
<p>&quot;After two cars blocked their way, two young men kicked them out of the car and drove off in it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The latest hijacking in the infamous &quot;corridor&quot; linking Tuzla to the Sava River and Croatia comes after Bosnian Serb police recently arrested nine men for hijacking and introduced anit-hijacking measures, Angelli said.</p>
