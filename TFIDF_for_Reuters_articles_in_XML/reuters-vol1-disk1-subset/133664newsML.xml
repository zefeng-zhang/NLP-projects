<headline>Clinton plays statesman; Dole says &quot;ignore polls&quot;.</headline>

<p>President Bill Clinton, nurturing an enormous lead in the polls exactly two weeks before Election Day, on Tuesday took on the statesman role on the campaign trail by calling for an expansion of NATO.</p>
<p>Republican Bob Dole meanwhile wrapped up a two-day bus tour through central Michigan struggling to persuade voters to take a second look at his candidacy. He reached back to 1948, when President Harry Truman came from behind in the polls to win a stunning Democratic victory over Thomas Dewey.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm like Harry Truman. I'm from the Midwest and I'm plain-spoken and I'm going to win whether you like it or not. I'm going to win on Nov. 5,&quot; Dole told a rally in Troy, Mich.</p>
<p>Clinton visited Detroit on Tuesday and set 1999, the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, as the target date for admitting new members from among former Communist nations in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I want to state America's goal: By 1999 -- NATO's 50th anniversary and 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- the first group of countries we invite to join should be full-fledged members of NATO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The president, who has not mentioned his opponent by name for days, was in the enviable position of being able to use the foreign policy speech to underline his role as commander-in-chief as the election approaches.</p>
<p>But Dole issued a statemant accusing Clinton of dragging his heels on expanding NATO. &quot;The time to begin expansion for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic is now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton's initiative was likely to be popular among the many people of Eastern European descent in the politically crucial Midwest -- not that he appeared to need much help.</p>
<p>The Reuters daily tracking poll gave Clinton an 11.3 percentage point advantage and other polls on Tuesday gave him an even larger lead. A CNN/USA Today Gallup poll said Clinton led by 21 percentage points, a CBS/New York Times survey said he was 22 points ahead and ABC said he led by 13 points.</p>
<p>A 10-point Clinton victory could turn into an overwhelming vote in the Electoral College. In the 1988 presidential election, Republican George Bush won by eight points but took 426 of the 538 electoral votes.</p>
<p>The presidential election is really 51 separate contests in each state and the District of Columbia, with the winner in each state getting votes in the Electoral College, where a majority of 270 is needed to be elected.</p>
<p>Many Republicans are now focusing on the battle to retain control of both houses of Congress, which they won only two years ago. Party chairman Haley Barbour said Republicans would gain both House and Senate seats, although he acknowledged that Dole was an underdog with an uphill fight on his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;If Clinton is re-elected, heaven forbid, the last thing the American people would want would be for him to have a blank check in the form of a liberal, Democrat Congress,&quot; Barbour said.</p>
<p>Clinton flew from Detroit to Florida for two days of campaigning in a state that has gone to the Republicans for the past two decades but where he now holds a narrow lead. Dole was also to head there on Wednesday to shore up support in the traditionally conservative Florida panahandle, the northwestern part of the state.</p>
<p>The Clinton campaign rejected a request from former first lady Nancy Reagan to stop running a television advertisement showing the 1981 assassination attempt against her husband, which she said &quot;stretches even the minimum levels of civility on current political advertising.&quot;</p>
<p>James Brady, who was President Ronald Reagan's press spokesman at the time, was badly wounded in the assassination attempt. He endorses Clinton because of the president's stand on gun control and is shown in the ads extolling him.</p>
