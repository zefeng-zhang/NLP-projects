<p>The turmoil in English rugby was no closer to a solution on Wednesday after a meeting between the England players and the organisation representing the clubs who want to split from the Rugby Football Union (RFU).</p>
<p>After boycotting a scheduled national training session, the 43-strong squad assembled at a Heathrow hotel to hear a presentation from the English Professional Rugby Union Clubs (EPRUC) who wish to take control of the domestic game.</p>
<p>EPRUC issued a brief statement after the meeting, which said the England squad had agreed &quot;in principle with EPRUC'S vision for the future&quot;.</p>
<p>EPRUC chairman Donald Kerr refused to comment further on the statement and said only: &quot;If you want to read into it that the England players agree with the breakaway, then fine.&quot;</p>
<p>The England management and coach Jack Rowell turned up as scheduled for the training session even though there were no players to work with.</p>
<p>RFU secretary Tony Hallett is expected to state the union's position on Thursday as they seek to regain control of a sport which has been transformed by the introduction of professionalism.</p>
<p>Among those also present at the meeting was Newcastle chairman Sir John Hall who had interrupted his holiday in Spain to be part of the negotiating team.</p>
<p>He said he was &quot;delighted&quot; with developments and added: &quot;It is very satisfying that they have kept away from training. We are all sticking together for the good of the game.&quot;</p>
