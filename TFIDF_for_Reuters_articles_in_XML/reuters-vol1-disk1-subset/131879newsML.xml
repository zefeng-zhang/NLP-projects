<headline>RTRS - Police probe WMC explosive finds.</headline>
<dateline>KALGOORLIE, Western Australia 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>Police on Monday said they were still investigating explosives found at homes of two WMC Ltd managers in the mining town of Kambalda.</p>
<p>A parcel of three gelignite-like sticks were found on Friday on the verandah of one manager's house, Detective Tom Cagan of the Kalgoorlie Police Department told Reuters. About one hour later, a second parcel was found on the windshield of the car parked at a house in Kambalda of another manager, Cagan said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, WMC, one of Australia's largest mining companies, announced it was laying off 445 workers in the Kambalda region, where it mines nickel and gold.  </p>
<p>Cragan would not comment on whether there was a connection between the explosives being found and the job cuts.</p>
<p>The explosives did not contain detonating devices.</p>
<p>The Australian Mine Workers Union distanced the union from the incidents.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whether there is any connection at all,&quot; spokesman Bob Krygsman said. &quot;You don't have to be a Rhodes Scholar to see it is a form of intimidation, but its certainly something we would not condone,&quot; Krygsman added.  </p>
<p>At the time of the layoffs, WMC said it expected most of the affected workes to be re-hired by independent mining contractors.</p>
<p>Krygsman said it remained uncertain how many workers would be rehired.</p>
<p>About 70 unfair dismissal claims have been filed by laid off workers with the government's Industrial Relations Commission.</p>
<p>Krygsman said mining contractors have said it will be about six weeks before mining operations at Kambalda return to normal.</p>
