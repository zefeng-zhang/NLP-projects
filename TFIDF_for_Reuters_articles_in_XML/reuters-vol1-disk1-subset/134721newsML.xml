<p>A new air cargo route between Europe and Asia over Russia could offer estimated savings of 30 percent over the traditional Middle East routes, the president of Russia's Volga-Dnepr Airlines, Alexey Isaikin said.</p>
<p>He told the 18th Air Cargo Forum that the biggest saving would come from reduced flying times, but precise savings would depend on the actual routes and type of aircraft being used.</p>
<p>The new route would enable importers and exporters to more airfreight more effectively between the newly industrialised countries of Asia, such as China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea to markets in the former CIS states and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Most cargo across across Russia today is moved on charters but market leaders are now considering scheduled services. &quot;Much of it consists of consumer goods from China, Thailand, and India, &quot;he said.</p>
<p>Three conditions are however needed to before Russia can hope to attract traffic from the Middle East route. These are &quot;the development of uptodate infrastructure for air cargo transhipment in the Russian Federation, alliances between leading European, Asian and Russina carriers and the use of both Western and Russian equipment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Isaikin added there was also a requirement for &quot;stable and modern customs system, more reasonable conditions for imports and exports,&quot; in Russia.</p>
<p>All airlines operating in the Russian market should combine forces and lobby government to protect their interests against the customs systems, he said.</p>
<p>Separately, Isaikin said, &quot;there is a demand for inter-modal transport in Russia. This is not very developed.... but very profitable. With the help of freight forwarders we could increase this type of service.&quot;</p>
