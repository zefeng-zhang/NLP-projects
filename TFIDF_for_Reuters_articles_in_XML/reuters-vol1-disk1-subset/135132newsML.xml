<p>Australia is headed for a record 1996/97 winter crop of 31.8 million tonnes, up 1.8 million tonnes on the previous record set in 1983/84, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said in a strongly upgraded forecast.</p>
<p>ABARE also forecasts Australia's 1996/97 wheat production at 20.9 million tonnes, almost four million tonnes higher than the almost 17.0 million tonnes produced last season.  </p>
<p>said in the report. &quot;Earlier concerns about waterlogging in parts of Western Australia (WA)... have been alleviated.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the report said the final outcome for Australian winter grains production would be influenced by factors such as the yield effect of late frosts in parts of Queensland and Victoria and weather conditions during harvest.</p>
<p>Weather forecasts for the three months to December suggest that most of Victoria and parts of New South Wales, Tasmania and WA have a significant chance of being wetter than average, ABARE said.  </p>
<p>The forecast record winter crop has been the product of above-average yields based on favourable weather, ABARE, Australia's official commodities forecasting agency, said in its latest Australian Crop Report.</p>
<p>ABARE has lifted its forecast winter crop from the previously-forecast near-record of 28.7 million tonnes, which included wheat production of 18.8 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;A combination of mild weather and above-average rainfall during August and September in most regions has generally been beneficial for crop development, and will show up in above-average yields,&quot; ABARE's executive director Brian Fisher  </p>
<p>&quot;Many winter crop areas face the possibility of wetter than usual conditions during harvest, leading to the possibility of quality downgrading and lower returns,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>ABARE is bullish about the 1996/97 summer crop season and forecasts a record cotton planting of 380,000 hectares, 25 percent more than last season.</p>
<p>Supplies of irrigation water are well up on last year, with storage levels in the major irrigation dams currently averaging 78 percent of capacity compared with less than 20 percent at the same time in 1995, ABARE said.  </p>
<p>For the 1996/97 summer crop season, good soil moisture had been established in most areas following the above-average rainfall of August and September, ABARE said.</p>
<p>Plantings will be able to start on time from October onwards and farmers will be able to sow their preferred crops, it said.</p>
<p>Falling cereal prices in recent months had made sorghum relatively less attractive, ABARE said. It is predicting a substantial expansion of sunflower plantings at the expense of sorghum and an increase in rice plantings to a new record.  </p>
<p>On the 1996/97 winter crop, ABARE said above-average yield prospects were the driving force behind the forecast record with the total winter crop this season covering 700,000 ha less than 1983/84.</p>
<p>The forecast 23 percent rise in wheat production was the result of a 13 percent increase in wheat plantings, brought about by high cereal prices at the time of sowing as well as higher yields in some states.  </p>
<p>The lateness of planting rains contributed to a 10 percent reduction in total winter pulse production, to 2.1 million tonnes. Winter oilseeds production is forecast to be 619,000 tonnes in 1996/97, marginally higher than that of the previous season, mainly as a result of improved yields.</p>
<p>The largest increase in wheat is forecast to be in NSW, where production is forecast to rise by 55 percent to 7.2 million tonnes in 1996/97.</p>
