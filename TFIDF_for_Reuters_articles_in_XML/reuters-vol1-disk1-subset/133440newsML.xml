<p>Grain prices broke a key downside barrier on Tuesday, while industrial metals prices yawned at news that Japanese prosecutors arrested Sumitomo's former star copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka for forgery in the first arrest in the world's costliest financial scandal.</p>
<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>In Chicago, the price of wheat slipped under the key $4.00 per bushel level, continuing its steady slide since touching record highs of over $7.00 in April.</p>
<p>Prices of the nearby futures contract carved out their lowest levels since June 1995 and breached an important psychological barrier.</p>
<p>The immediate cause of concern on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was a hike in an estimate for Australia's 1996-97 wheat crop that was two million tonnes over the previous forcast.</p>
<p>But this was only one more indication that fears were overdone early this year of continuing shortages after global grain stocks fell to 20-year lows.</p>
<p>Crops around the world have bounced back and fresh rainfall in the US bread basket presages a bounteous harvest in 1997/98.</p>
<p>December ended below $4.00 per bushel, the lowest level for a nearby contract since June 1995 and an important psychological benchmark support area. Technicians cite support now at $3.98 and $3.92 per bushel for the December contract. Wheat closed one to three cents per bushel lower, with December down one at $3.99-1/2.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Copper prices shrugged off news that Japanese prosecutors arrested former copper trader Hamanaka, accused by Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo of losing $2.6 billion through unauthorised deals.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Corp issued a criminal complaint against its former star trader, but said it had found no evidence he had manipulated markets.</p>
<p>Copper prices -- which tumbled from a high of $2,715 per tonne in June after Sumitomo uncovered the scandal -- held to recent ranges.</p>
<p>It finished the afternoon on the London Metal Exchange, the world's centre for industrial metals trade, up $9 at $1,960, failing to challenge a key barrier of $1,970.</p>
<p>Copper stocks in LME warehouses fell on Tuesday by a substantial 13,075 tonnes, bringing the total decline since the end of August to well over 100,000 tonnes. Availability of scrap copper is also tight, but prices remain stalled.</p>
<p>Some analysts say banks which have taken over Sumitomo's positions are taking advantage of price spikes to liquidate them.</p>
<p>Aluminium rose on speculative buying, helped on its way by a fall in stocks of 2,875 tonnes. Prices ended up $15 at $1,367. Lead followed the market leaders higher in a correction to recent heavy losses. The market ended $7 firmer at $732 after stocks rose 300 tonnes.</p>
<p>Nickel gained $90 to $7,160 despite a modest rise in stocks of 120 tonnes. Tin managed to rise just $10 to $5,990 after stocks rose 230 tonnes. Zinc barely budged, gaining $0.50 to $1,025 on a stock draw of 1,750 tonnes.</p>
<p>Alloy was last at $1,245 from $1,225/30. Stocks fell 320 tonnes.</p>
<p>GOLD</p>
<p>In other markets, gold prices marched higher, fixing at the strongest level in five weeks at $383.35 per ounce and the other precious metals followed.</p>
<p>Dealers attributed gold's gains to market players covering short positions after prices tenaciously held above the key $380 level during downside tests over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>COMEX December gold ended up $2.20 an ounce at $386.10, after trading up to a four week high at $386.50, on high estimated gold futures volume of 48,000 lots. In New York bullion trade, spot gold ended quoted $383.90/384.40, its highest level since September 9, compared to the London Tuesday afternoon fix at $383.35 and the New York close Monday at $381.75/382.25.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX gasoline prices ended higher Tuesday on news Petroleos de Venezuela's Amuay refinery suffered a partial outage, while heating oil prices declined on prospects of increasing supplies, traders said. November gasoline settled up 1.20 cents at 69.12 cents a gallon while November heating oil ended off 0.18 cent at 73.45 cents a gallon. The rise in gasoline prices took November crude to a contract high of $26.10 a barrel at a time when crude is already at five-year highs. But, November crude closed off 17 cents a barrel to $25.75 as the November  contract expired Tuesday and traders rolled positions into the December contract.  </p>
