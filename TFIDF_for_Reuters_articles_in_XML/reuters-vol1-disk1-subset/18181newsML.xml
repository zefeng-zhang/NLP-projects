<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-08-28</dateline>

<p>The European Commission confirmed on Wednesday that it had cleared the acquisition of Austrian retail chain Billa by Germany's Rewe, the biggest takeover in Austria's history.</p>
<p>In a statement, the European Union executive said it had no serious concerns about the deal's impact on competition.</p>
<p>However, it said it would continue to follow the further development of concentration in the retail sector carefully and also pay attention to the aspect of buying power.</p>
<p>Billa, with 1995 sales of about three billion Ecus, is Austria's biggest retailer with a market share of more than 28 percent.</p>
<p>Rewa is one of the leading groups in food retail in Germany. The group last year had a total turnover of 25 billion Ecus.</p>
<p>The Commission said the deal has an impact on mainly on the competitive position of Billa in the food retail market in Austria.</p>
<p>It said that the competitive position of Billa would be improved because it would have possibilities of joint purchasing with Rewe.</p>
<p>&quot;The concentration does, however, not lead to an addition in market shares since Billa has no activities in Germany and Rewe is so far not active in Austria,&quot; the Commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Likewise, the concentration does not give rise to serious competition problems from the point of view of an increase in buying power,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The Commission said that since the second largest retail chain in Austria, the Spar group, is a strong competitor the deal would not lead to a dominant position of Billa in Austrian food retailing.</p>
