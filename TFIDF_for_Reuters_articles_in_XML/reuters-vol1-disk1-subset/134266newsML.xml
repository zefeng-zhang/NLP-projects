<p>The Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement Tuesday with General Motors Corp. to end a crippling 19-day strike by 26,000 workers across Canada that also idled 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a new 1996 collective agreement,&quot; a triumphant Canadian Auto Workers President Buzz Hargrove told a packed news conference after marathon negotiations ended.</p>
<p>The tentative three-year deal with GM's Canadian unit was reached after days of intense, round-the-clock bargaining at a downtown Toronto hotel during which several deadlines were missed as new snags cropped up in the talks.</p>
<p>GM Canada workers, fearful that the auto giant was intent on cutting its costs at the expense of union jobs, began an escalating strike Oct. 2 to back demands for a limit on contracting out jobs, known as outsourcing. The union also pressed for improvements to mandatory overtime rules and working conditions.</p>
<p>GM chief negotiator Dean Munger said the hard-fought deal was a win-win agreement for both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get it ratified. It's a good agreement. It suits our business needs and fits your members' needs,&quot; Munger told the union's negotiating team.</p>
<p>Membership meetings were set for Wednesday for the rank and file to ratify the pact, and Hargrove said workers could be back at their jobs as early as Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The labour pact includes a pledge by GM to recognise limits on contracting out work and allows the sale of two Ontario plants. Some 3,800 union jobs will be lost, but the workers will be protected by the new contract for three years and will have several options to seek new positions.</p>
<p>The union, in turn, made a major concession by accepting that GM's business plan may require deviance from a pattern agreement reached in September with Chrysler Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to moving to the future now,&quot; said Hargrove. &quot;I would have hoped we could have done it without a strike.&quot;</p>
<p>The escalating strike paralysed GM's plants in Canada and the ripple effect resulted in the layoffs of some 20,000 GM workers in the United States and Mexico as the flow of parts from Canada dried up.</p>
<p>In Canada, concern was mounting that the strike at the country's largest private employer would deliver a blow to Canada's anaemic economy. Economists estimated a prolonged strike could shave up to one percentage point off fourth-quarter growth.</p>
<p>Hargrove and his sometimes militant membership were determined to wring concesessions from GM Canada, which last year recorded the largest ever profit by a Canadian company.</p>
<p>The talks stalled after the first week as both sides dug in with their demands. An unprecedented meeting last Wednesday at a airport hotel between Hargrove and GM Chief Executive Jack Smith broke the logjam in the crucial outsourcing issue.</p>
<p>The same day in a dramatic standoff, 160 workers occupied GM's Oshawa, Ontario, plant in an effort to prevent the company from removing equipment in order to maintain supplies to the United States.</p>
<p>The union will now turn its attention to Ford Motor Co. of Canada to forge a deal for 11,690 auto workers.</p>
