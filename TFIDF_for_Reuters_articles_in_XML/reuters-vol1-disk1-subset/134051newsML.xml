<p>The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday unanimously called for a ceasefire and political negotiations in Afghanistan as fighting showed no signs of abating north of Kabul, the capital.</p>
<p>In an obvious reference to the radical Islamic Taleban movement that captured Kabul last month, the council's resolution denounced what it called discrimination against girls and women and warned of &quot;possible repercussions on international relief and reconstruction programmes in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
<p>The Taleban have forbidden women to work or attend schools and universities.</p>
<p>The resolution, initiated by Russia, called for states to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs &quot;including the involvement of foreign miitary personnel&quot; and to stop supplying arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>But it did not impose an arms embargo, as neighbouring Pakistan had wanted. Members said an embargo would be impossible to enforce and would probably favour the Taleban.</p>
<p>The resolution requested Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and U.N. representatives to cooperate with interested states and organisations such as the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to promote a political dialogue.</p>
<p>Pakistan has offered to negotiate a ceasefire. &quot;I am more than hopeful (for a ceasefire accord) because in principle they have all agreed,&quot; Pakistani Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar said in Islamabad.</p>
<p>U.N. envoy Norbert Holl, who planned to visit the northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif, said on Monday he welcomed the Pakistan initiative but no single country could bring peace to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So far, the Taleban and troops supporting the ousted Afghan government of Burhanuddin Rabbani have put conditions on a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Gen. Ahmad Shah Masood, whose ethnic Tajik forces hold territory close to the capital, has said that Kabul should be demilitarized first.</p>
<p>Masood has formed an alliance against the Taleban with his former rival, Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, who holds territory in the north.</p>
<p>For the past week fighting has been confined to a 20 mile (32 km) stretch of the main road from Kabul to the northern strongholds of Masood and Dostum.</p>
<p>Sponsors of the council's resolution were Germany, the United States, France, Italy, South Korea and five former Soviet republics -- Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
