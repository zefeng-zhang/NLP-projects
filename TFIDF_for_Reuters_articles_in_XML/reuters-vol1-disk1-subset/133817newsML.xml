<headline>U.S. Mid-Atlantic spot power firm amid natgas rise.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spot wholesale electricity prices in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic were mostly firmer Tuesday compared with Monday's level amid a rally in natural gas prices for the second day.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is concentrating on the winter months. People are expecting a cold winter again,&quot; said a trader who deals in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool.</p>
<p>During midday Tuesday, NYMEX November Henry Hub natgas gas climbed as high as $2.620, up 13.8 cents per million British thermal units following a 8.2 cent jump Monday.</p>
<p>Continual strength in natgas and residual fuel oil prices have piled up the replacement costs of those fuels used at fossil-fueled plants this winter, said brokers and marketers.</p>
<p>&quot;People are using them as measures for winter generation costs,&quot; said the PJM trader.</p>
<p>Bucking today's action, PJM values for next-day delivery softened despite delayed returns of several regional nuclear power units from refueling.</p>
<p>Firm, peak PJM electricity for Wednesday delivery was quoted at $21.00-$22.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), down from Monday's $21.50-$22.50.</p>
<p>Modest power demand seemed to override concerns about short-term generation tightness, brokers and traders said.</p>
<p>November PJM electricity for firm, peak delivery was assessed at $23.20-$23.60, up from a quote of $22.90-$23.25.</p>
<p>December PJM power with similar delivery terms was discussed between $28.00 and $28.40, up from Monday's range of $27.50-$27.75.</p>
<p>January/February 1997 PJM deliveries were pegged at $32.00-$32.25, higher than a Monday quote of $31.25-$31.75.</p>
<p>First-quarter 1997 PJM electricity was valued at $29.30-$29.75, up from $29.10-$29.50 on Monday.</p>
<p>Second-quarter 1997 power prices in PJM was quoted at $21.80-$22.50, compared with Monday's $21.75-$21.85.</p>
<p>July/August 1997 PJM deliveries were still talked at $31.00-$31.35.</p>
<p>The 610 megawatt (MW) Oyster Creek nuclear plant in Forked River, N.J., and 1,090 MW Susquehanna 1 nuclear unit in Berwick, Pa., were expected to resume operation some time Wednesday. Both generating stations were scheduled to return to service this past week.</p>
<p>Moreover, Virginia Power Co's 909 MW North Anna 2 nuclear plant in Mineral, Va., was shut Monday to repair a small leak in a high-pressure steam line, and would resume service later this week.</p>
