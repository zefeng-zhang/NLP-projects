<p>Columns of refugees fleeing violence in east Zaire headed for the town of Bukavu and the U.N. said it feared a crisis like that in Rwanda in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has now deteriorated to such an extent that we are almost back to an emergency phase like we were facing in 1994,&quot; Ron Redmond, spokesman for the U.N refugee agency UNHCR, said in Geneva on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The agency was making contingency plans to receive 75,000 of the refugees in existing camps in the Bukavu area, 75 km (50 miles) north of Uvira. About 3,000 Rwandans have already shown up at Nyangezi-Mulwa camp there.</p>
<p>UNHCR had reports of a column of 10,000 refugees on the road heading for Bukavu. Zairean troops were meeting the refugees at Nyantende and directing them to camps west of Bukavu, it said.</p>
<p>Eastern Zaire has been gripped by unrest since the 1994 massacres and civil war in Rwanda sent more than a million Hutu refugees streaming in, stoking ethnic rivalry in the area.</p>
<p>Fighting has widened in the last six weeks since the Zaire army got drawn into long-running ethnic clashes between Tutsi immigrants, known as Banyamulenge, and native Zaireans.</p>
<p>The latest violence is centred around the town of Uvira, 100 km (65 miles) from the South Kivu Provincial capital Bukavu.</p>
<p>The fighting has fuelled fears that the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry which triggered the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the equally bitter civil war in Burundi could engulf the whole Central African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>The United Nations is worried that the armies of neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi, both dominated by Tutsis, might be drawn in on the side of the Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;I am deeply worried by the widening scale of violence in eastern Zaire in recent weeks that has once again sent tens of thousands of refugees -- women, children, sick and elderly -- fleeing for their lives,&quot; UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata said in a statement. &quot;Unless all parties to this conflict step back, we are, I am afraid, heading toward a humanitarian catastrophe.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaire's former colonial ruler Belgium advised its nationals in the troubled Kivu region on Tuesday to make arrangements to leave as fighting flared around the area.</p>
<p>&quot;The 350 or so Belgians living in this province are advised to be extremely cautious and to make contact with the Belgian Embassy in Kinshasa to discover the safest route for leaving the region,&quot; s foreign ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>The U.N. evacuated aid workers from Uvira on Tuesday and said food supplies for refugees would last only six days.</p>
<p>&quot;A total of 48 aid workers from United Nations agencies and international non-governmental organisations (NGOS) were evacuated from Uvira. They had been held up for three days in aid agency compounds due to heavy fighting in the area,&quot; a spokesman for the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) told Reuters.</p>
<p>Humanitarian sources spoke of an attack around Kamanyola refugee camp in the south. Reports of Rwandan troops being involved could not immediately be confirmed.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported armed soldiers walking with refugees. &quot;The fact that Zairean soldiers themselves are withdrawing is adding to the panic amongst refugees,&quot; one relief source said.</p>
<p>The refugee exodus followed a flare-up on Friday in fighting between Zairean soldiers and Banyamulenge around Uvira.</p>
<p>There was no reliable death toll from the fighting. Relief workers said local staff in the Uvira area had asked for 78 body bags and had spoken of 60 wounded, mostly civilians.</p>
