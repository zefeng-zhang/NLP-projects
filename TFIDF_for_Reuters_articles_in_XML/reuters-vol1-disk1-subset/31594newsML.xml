<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was due to fly to Chechnya on Thursday for talks with separatist leaders less than a week after signing an ambitious peace deal for the breakaway region.</p>
<p>Lebed will arrive in a region still unsure of peace and only just beginning to clear the wreckage of 21 months of war.</p>
<p>In Grozny on Wednesday, a group of middle-aged women, hair bundled up in headscarves, bent double sweeping the streets of a city that once numbered 400,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>They raised huge clouds of dust as they swept bomb-blasted stone and twisted metal debris into neatish piles. It seemed a near futile effort against the backdrop of buildings blown apart in the fighting, crater-pocked roads and tangles of metal left by anything from tramlines to knocked-out Russian tanks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have cleared up after each ceasefire agreement and we hope that this will be the last time,&quot; said Zina Matashev, 51, one of the women sweeping the roads.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have peace so let them leave us in peace,&quot; she added, tears welling in her eyes. Lebed's spokesman gave no details of his talks, which follow a meeting on Wednesday between the Kremlin envoy's representative in Chechnya with Russian military officials and separatist leaders at the village of Novye Atagi.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said that meeting dealt with ironing out problems in implementing the peace deal.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency, quoting a separatist source, said Lebed may meet rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, with whom he signed the accord on Saturday. Interfax said Maskhadov pledged on Thursday to bar any parade celebrating the fifth anniversary of Chechnya's self-declared independence on Friday.</p>
<p>Another signs of a return to something like normality after the rebels seized the city in last month's battle was the market on Ulitsa Mira (Peace Street), where traders worked flat out.</p>
<p>Yet the fighting and a terrifying ultimatum from the Russian army to flatten the city caused a flood of refugees which added to hundreds of thousands already forced from their homes.</p>
<p>Fery Aalame, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Grozny, said some 80,000 to 100,000 people may have been forced to flee Grozny by the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;The civilian population has suffered a lot, there is a complete lack of clean water...there is no medical structure,&quot; Aalame told reporters in the capital.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is helping to restart water supplies and was bringing in some 600,000 litres (132,000 gallons) a day to the civilian population. It is also supplying food and medicines.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin's top aide, Anatoly Chubais, said on Wednesday he was likely to meet Lebed later in the day to discuss Chechnya. There was no confirmation that they did meet.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who dropped from sight in late June and is now on holiday near Moscow, has not publicly backed Lebed's peace deal, which defers a decision on Chechen independence for five years.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, seen as a rival to Lebed, has given the accord his guarded approval.</p>
<p>Ekho Moskvy radio station said Chubais also met the head of the pro-Moscow authority in Chechnya, Doku Zavgayev, who says Lebed has sidelined him and handed power to the separatists.</p>
<p>Zavgayev still commands loyalty in northern Chechnya, where the separatists have never held control. Some observers say that will mean inter-Chechen tensions after Russian troops withdraw.</p>
