<title>GERMANY: Kohl defends Waigel after German tax feud.</title>
<headline>Kohl defends Waigel after German tax feud.</headline>
<dateline>HANOVER, Germany 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday defended his finance minister and said the centre-right Bonn coalition, deeply split last week in a tax dispute, must stick together and win the 1998 election.</p>
<p>Kohl told fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) at the start of their annual congress that Theo Waigel, chairman of the allied Christian Social Union (CSU), was a dependable finance minister who faced enormous tasks.</p>
<p>The 14-year coalition of CDU, CSU and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) could use some improvements, he admitted, but staying together was the only way for them to win re-election.</p>
<p>Kohl's coalition came dangerously close to collapse last week when Waigel and the FDP battled over a possible petrol tax increase to ensure the 1997 budget deficit was low enough to qualify for Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>The coalition agreed on Friday to delay a planned cut in the hated solidarity surcharge, a tax to help rebuild the ex-communist east, but coalition members continued to squabble over the weekend about when taxes could next be cut.</p>
<p>Kohl demonstratively thanked Waigel and said: &quot;He is the target of many attacks, but he is a dependable man.&quot;</p>
<p>The coalition had been through good and bad times in the past 14 years, added Kohl, who on October 31 will set a record as Germany's longest-serving postwar chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also true that this or that could be improved in our coalition, despite all its successes,&quot; he said.  &quot;Our goal is clear -- we want to continue this coalition of the centre beyond 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>The two-day CDU congress in Hanover was due to discuss plans for tax reform, introduce a quota for women office holders and hold elections for the party leadership.  Kohl, CDU chairman for the past 23 years, has no challenger.</p>
