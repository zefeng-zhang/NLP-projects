<p>Few seasoned market watchers would describe sterling as a one-way bet, but for now all the signs seem to be pointing in one direction -- upwards.</p>
<p>Healthy fundamental and technical indicators, detachment from the monetary union worries which are weighing down other European currencies, expectations of steady British interest rates and recent U.S. raids on Iraq, have all bolstered the pound.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling is an easy, safe play to take a slightly long position from,&quot; Chris Tinker, chief treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The pound hit $1.5695 in Europe on Tuesday, its strongest point since November 1995. Against the mark and yen, it has climbed to its best levels since mid-July.</p>
<p>Sterling's rise against the yen reflected flows out of energy importers into exporters as oil prices jumped on developments in the Gulf, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraqi situation...will continue to represent an additional excuse to sell the yen, especially against the pound with its pseudo petro-currency status,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell here.</p>
<p>While British oil exports still outweigh imports, they no longer make the major contribution to the economy they did when North Sea production got underway in earnest.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling has never quite shaken off the petro-currency tag, even though the trade figures would give the lie to that,&quot; said Nick Parsons, forex strategist at Banque Paribas in Paris.</p>
<p>Closer to home, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke holds his monthly meeting with Bank of England Governor Eddie George on Wednesday, but most analysts do not expect base rates to fall from their current 5.75 percent.</p>
<p>Thirteen out of 20 economists asked by Reuters believed Clarke would heed the advice of the BoE governor not to cut rates, despite the temptation of making voter-friendly cuts in the run-up to the general election, which must be held by next May.</p>
<p>Buoyant economic data such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released earlier this week bolster the case for steady rates, analysts said. August's PMI was the strongest for a year.</p>
<p>The British housing market is at last picking up, while upbeat evidence from the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chamber of Commerce have belied the argument that rates should be cut to haul manufacturing out of the doldrums.</p>
<p>Britain's July industrial production data due on Friday is seen rising 0.5 percent after June's shock 1.1 percent plunge, confirming that the worst is over for manufacturers.</p>
<p>Such data are in sharp contrast to those coming from other European countries, such as France, which on Wednesday reported a 0.4 percent contraction in GDP and a one percent fall in consumer spending for the second quarter.</p>
<p>The figures further burdened the already battered French franc as they cast yet more doubt on the government's ability to meet the stiff criteria for European monetary union.</p>
<p>That, too, has benefited sterling as it watches the EMU debate from the sidelines, with players targeting the pound as a &quot;safe haven&quot; from ever-increasing EMU doubts.</p>
<p>&quot;You can come up with a very good reason to sell French francs, you can get caught on the crosses against the other Europeans,&quot; said Standard Chartered's Tinker.</p>
<p>&quot;But you're not going to get caught unaware by someone suddenly coming up with a very good reason to sell sterling.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, chart watchers saw the pound consolidating its recent gains, with room for mild slippage as it prepares an advance on 2.33 marks, while it has the potential to climb to $1.5730, analysts said.</p>
<p>Sterling stood at 2.3256 marks and $1.5669 by 1030 GMT versus 2.3260 and $1.5675 in late European trade on Tuesday.</p>
