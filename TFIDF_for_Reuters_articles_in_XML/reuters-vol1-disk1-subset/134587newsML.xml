<p>Copper prices will break their June low of $1,745 a tonne, sliding over the next few months to the 1993 low of $1,612, Waterside Futures said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A rally from the June low to a high of $2,160 in September contained an Elliot Wave pattern that indicated a counter-trend formation, Waterside said in its latest Wavetrack report.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite simply, that indicates that the downtrend...is incomplete and that a price decline below $1,745 will occur during the next few months,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;An absolute low is forecast towards $1,612, which is the mainstream support last traded in October 1993.&quot;</p>
<p>An alternate scenario also sees copper falling toward $1,612, but expects prices to first rally to $2,092.</p>
<p>In this case, a much larger triangle trading range would be formed, with prices declining in the short term to $1,915, followed by two strong advances to $1,990 and $2,050 before heading down again to the 1993 nadir.</p>
<p>Aluminium is seen most likely rising to $1,387 over the next week or two, then declining to $1,287 and $1,254.</p>
<p>Earlier, it had appeared that prices were beginning an advance from its October 10 low of $1,304 to targets around $1,544.</p>
<p>&quot;This has not happened. In fact, each advance from $1,304 has been followed by deep retracements of the gains, which is typical behaviour in a counter-trend advance where the larger trend is downwards,&quot; the report said.</p>
