<p>Russia's tough stance against U.S. missile strikes on Iraq was fuelled by fears they could hurt its chances of recouping Baghdad's massive debt to the former Soviet Union, newspapers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The newspapers, analysing a complex Moscow position which appears to distance it from the West and bring it closer to Baghdad, said Russia had hoped to benefit from a United Nations agreement to let sanction-squeezed Iraq sell $2 billion of oil.</p>
<p>&quot;Baghdad's debt to Moscow is about $7 billion and Iraq could return a significant part of that with free oil sales on the world market,&quot; the liberal opposition daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote on its front page.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia's hopes of making money from Iraqi oil crashed with the explosion of the first missile,&quot; the Izvestia daily wrote.</p>
<p>The deal, aimed at bringing relief to the Iraqi people after six years of sanctions imposed after the Gulf War, foresees sales of oil in return for food, medicine and other goods.</p>
<p>But Britain's U.N. envoy Stephen Gomersall said the situation would have to revert to the status quo before oil sales could begin. After the deal was drawn up, Iraqi troops attacked the Kurdish north of the country, provoking two barrages of U.S. cruise missiles on southern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Russian government, the foreign ministry and President Boris Yeltsin's administration have reacted strongly to the U.S. attacks, launched on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Russian government demanded a halt to all military action against Iraq and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the bombings could lead to &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot; and &quot;anarchy&quot; on the world scene.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais said the president saw serious complications from the attacks.</p>
<p>But government officials insisted that the halt of oir-for-food deal had not hurt Russian interests too much and hinted that Moscow even saw some trade gains from the latest crisis in the long run.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather talk about missing out on some immediate profits than about real losses,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Viktor Posuvalyuv as saying. He had left Baghdad for Moscow just hours before the first U.S. strike.</p>
<p>Posuvalyuk said Russia would bow to the decision on a temporary halt to the oil-for-food programme but added that it was preparing to take part in it fully after resumption.</p>
<p>&quot;We received firm promises in Iraq that Russia, and not companies from other countries also interested in developing economic links with Baghdad,...will be a priority partner,&quot; Posuvalyuk said.</p>
<p>&quot;However events develop now, we are looking forward to the time when we will be able to have full-scale economic cooperation with this country,&quot; he added. &quot;We're getting ready for the time when different states and firms start competing for cooperation with Iraq.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has generally taken a softer line on Iraq than the United States since the end of the Gulf conflict, and has been pushing Washington and its Western European allies to lift crippling post-war sanctions against Baghdad.</p>
<p>Newspapers, echoing Primakov, suggested the air strikes were launched to help President Bill Clinton win the November presidential elections.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's closest rival in a June election and arch-enemy, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, backed the government line, accusing Washington of appointing itself a &quot;world policeman&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unprecedented event which is making the whole planet nervous and these actions remind me of state terrorism. I fully back the Russian foreign ministry position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Russian oil producers seemed content with the U.S. action. Interfax news agency quoted experts as saying producers and exporters stood to make an extra $7 on every tonne sold to the West in early September.</p>
