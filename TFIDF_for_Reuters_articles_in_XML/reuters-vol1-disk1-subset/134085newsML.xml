<dateline>MADRID 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Spain's Catalan regional government will tender on Wednesday five- and 10-year bonds in its first auction ever, an effort to improve market transparency and reduce financing costs, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Comunidad Autonoma de Catalunya will tap the market with five billion pesetas of five year bonds at a coupon of 8.10 percent, and five billion pesetas of ten year bonds at 8.85 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We're moving from a private collocation system to the auctions in order to improve our capacity to issue and to obatin better conditions on the market,&quot; Ruiz del Portal, financial director of the Generalitad of Catalunya told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Until now, only Valencia and Andalucia had set up a system of periodic and public auctions on their peseta bonds, which offer very good conditions, experts said.</p>
<p>Valencia in particular is considered to have among the best market conditions with a very tight spread over Spanish government bonds. On average the spread on its bonds are around 15-20 basis points over Bonos in the same maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;On the 10-year bonds the spread over bonos was around 20-25 basis points. What we are trying to do is to push it under 18 basis points,&quot; del Portal said.</p>
<p>At tomorrow's auction bids should be presented before 0800 GMT with results expected to be avaliable from 0900 GMT.</p>
<p>With these auctions Catalunya is trying to set up an entirely new system of market-makers for Catalan bonds which should start in January 1997, del Portal said.</p>
<p>Qualifications to be market-markers will be based on the participation in this first auction and the next ones, scheduled for November 20 and December 18.</p>
<p>Banks registered to participate in tomorrow's auction are Ahorro Corporation Financiera, Bank of America, Bankinter, BBV, Banca Catalana, BCH, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Deutsche Bank, General de valor y Canvio, Indosuez, Caja de Madrid, JP Morgan, Argentaria, BNP, Caja de Ahorro y de Pensiones, Bank Pyme, Sabadell, Santander and Societe General.</p>
<p>In absolute terms Catalunya has the highest level of debt among the 17 Spanish local governments, at 1.018 trillion pesetas at the end of June 1996.</p>
<p>Bank of Spain data showed this debt is divided into 702 billion of loans with credit institutions, 257 billion pesetas in bonds and non-tradeable debt, 18 billion in short term bills and 41 billion in bonds in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to increase the amount of debt tradeable on the market, improving the secondary market,&quot; del Portal said.</p>
<p>Catalunya is considered one of the richest regions in Spain and its debt is still one of the highest in relative terms. A recent study published by the Confederacion Espanola de Cajas de Ahorro showed that a ratio to gross domestic product Catalunya debt rose to 7.3 percent at the end of 1995 from 3.6 percent in 1992. These values were respectively at 5.7 percent at 3.6 percent for the whole of Spain.</p>
<p>Moody's rating for Catalunya stands at A1, while Sandard &amp; Poor's is AA-.</p>
