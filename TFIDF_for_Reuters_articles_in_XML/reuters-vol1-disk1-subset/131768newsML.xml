<p>India's latest money policy, aimed at freeing frozen bank funds and cash in the hands of farmers, is likely to push up demand for gold in the Indian sub-continent in the near-term, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers in Dubai, the feeder market for gold imports into India and Pakistan, said the Gulf gold market will also get a shot in the arm from rising sub-continent demand.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in a bid to improve liquidity in the economy, allowed banks to pump nearly 85 billion rupees ($2.38 billion) into money markets over the next four months.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these funds will certainly come into the bullion market,&quot; said Makhanlal Damani, president of the Bombay Bullion Association.</p>
<p>Dealers said the RBI policy for the second half of fiscal 1996/97 (April/March) had also lifted credit controls on commodities such as sugar, cotton and oilseeds.</p>
<p>&quot;The RBI policy has no direct bearing on gold and silver but it will improve the overall market sentiment,&quot; Damani said.</p>
<p>He said Indian demand for gold will go up, which need not necessarily push prices up as these depended mainly on international trends.</p>
<p>&quot;But I can say that rising demand will take Indian gold consumption to more than 500 tonnes this year,&quot; Damani said.</p>
<p>The Indian policy coincided with the harvest of winter crops in India and Pakistan, resulting in increased money flows with the farmers in both countries.</p>
<p>Dealers in Karachi, Pakistan's chief commercial city, predicted gold prices would rise on higher demand from jewellers in the cotton-growing areas of the Punjab province.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold demand from jewellers in Punjab is rising slightly due to the cotton harvest,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Demand for gold in India, the world's largest consumer of the yellow metal, is driven mainly by three factors -- wedding seasons, harvest and festivals.</p>
<p>On Monday, bullion markets across India were closed for Dassera, as the majority of the country's 900 million people celebrated a Hindu feast marking the victory of good over evil.</p>
<p>In the week to Saturday, gold prices rose 25 rupees per 10 grammes to 5,150 rupees on the Bombay bullion market.</p>
<p>Dealers say gold demand will get a fillip ahead of and during Diwali, the festival of lights, which falls on November 10 and 11.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold buying is traditionally a part of festival glitter and rite,&quot; said Damani, adding that the winter wedding season in December would follow Diwali.</p>
<p>Dealers in Dubai, cheered by the Indian factors, on Sunday predicted a bullish outlook for gold in the business hub of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
