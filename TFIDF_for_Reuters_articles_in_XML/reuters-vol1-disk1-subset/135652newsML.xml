<p>Singapore shares opened flat on Tuesday but newly-listed Delifrance Asia and Labroy Marine continued to steal the limelight in active trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Except for these recently listed stocks, sentiment was weak following Monday's weaker than expected September trade data, where non-oil exports fell 6.2 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent trade data and news have not been very supportive and this continues to add to market pessimism,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>At 0230 GMT, the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index was at 2,045.89, up 1.66 points. Market volume was meagre at 22 million shares with gainers beating losers by 91 to 45.</p>
<p>Delifrance Asia and Labroy Marine topped the actives, with 3.3 million and 2.9 million shares traded respectively. Both made further gains, with Delifrance at Singapore $0.995 (US$0.71) and Labroy Marine at S$0.965.</p>
<p>OUB Foreign and CityDev were among the gainers, rising S$0.15 and S$0.10 respectively to S$9.50 and S$10.50.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Antah Holding led the losers, shedding S$0.82 to S$1.07 on 10,000 shares.</p>
<p>Some dealers saw the STII hovering around its present level in the near term. They pegged support at 2,030, where a break could lead it to test 2,000-1,900.</p>
<p>US$1.00=S$1.41</p>
