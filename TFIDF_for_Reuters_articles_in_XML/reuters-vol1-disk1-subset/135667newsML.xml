<p>Australian Open champion Boris Becker won a serving shoot-out with Briton Greg Rusedski in his opening match of the Stuttgart Open on Wednesday but acknowledged afterwards he was still playing in pain.</p>
<p>Becker, trying to get back to his best after suffering a serious wrist injury at this year's Wimbledon, delighted his home crowd with a 6-4 6-4 second round victory.</p>
<p>The three-times Wimbledon champion joined the tournament's other big draws Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in the third round. But the German said afterwards: &quot;The more I play, the more it hurts. But it comes with the package.</p>
<p>&quot;The injury has gone but because I had a cast for so long some of the muscles disappeared. I can only get them back by playing tournaments.&quot;</p>
<p>World number one Sampras had few problems in disposing Armenian Sargis Sargsian 6-3 6-4 while Agassi beat Spaniard Alberto Berasategui 6-1 7-6.</p>
<p>Becker needs good results at the $2.2 million event to ensure a place at next month's season-ending world championship in Hanover. The German won the title last year.</p>
<p>But he said his main goal at the moment was simply getting fit enough to play.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes going to the doctor has been more exhausting than playing tournaments,&quot; he said. &quot;But my priority at the moment has been on getting fit. It would be nice to make it to Hanover but I have only been thinking about my body recently.&quot;</p>
<p>When Becker is playing in front of his fanatical German supporters, it is hard not to feel sympathy for his opponent.</p>
<p>Although he missed several key chances to get a grip on the match, the Canadian-born Rusedski played some crisp volleys and passing shots, but only a handful of people put their hands together to applaude them.</p>
<p>By contrast they roared every movement from Becker.</p>
<p>Becker took an early initiative with a service break in the third game when Rusedski netted a forehand. Although the German was not serving at his best, he clinched the first set after 39 minutes when the Briton hit a wide service return.</p>
<p>In the ninth game of the second set the German hit a superb forehand passing shot to break again and lead 5-4. In the next game he fired an ace to wrap-up the match in 68 minutes.</p>
<p>Earlier, defending champion and third seed Thomas Muster limped out of the tournament with a recurring hip injury.</p>
<p>Australia's Mark Woodforde was leading 3-0 in the deciding third set when the Austrian hobbled off the court.</p>
<p>&quot;I have had this for a few years and it is not getting better,&quot; said Muster. &quot;If I knew what to do with it I would be a doctor, not a tennis player.&quot;</p>
<p>Former world number one Stefan Edberg, playing his last year on the tour, also went out in the second round losing 7-6 6-3 to Croatia's fifth seed Goran Ivanisevic.</p>
