<text>
<p>A Mexican judge has ordered the arrest of former world champion boxer Julio Cesar Chavez on tax fraud charges, the Finance Ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>Mexican Chavez and his business partners in his home state of Sinaloa failed to pay some 10.58 million pesos ($1.39 million) in taxes to the government, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>Tax officials have been auditing Chavez's tax records for more than a year. He has denied any wrongdoing and said his former business partners, family and friends have betrayed him in order to get at his money.</p>
<p>Chavez lost his WBC super-lightweight title to American Oscar De La Hoya in Las Vegas on June 7. He was stopped in the fourth round.</p>
