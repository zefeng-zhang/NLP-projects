<headline>RESEARCH ALERT: Lehman rates Israeli banks.</headline>

<p>Lehman Brothers said it was retaining its 2-Outperform rating for Bank Leumi as well as its 3-Neutral rating for Bank Hapoalim, following their second-quarter earnings reports.</p>
<p>The banks are Israel's two largest.</p>
<p>&quot;Bank Leumi's second quarter results look to us to represent a pretty good performance in a tough environment,&quot; analyst Ian McEwen said in a report.</p>
<p>Net interest revenues were a little below those of the first quarter but above prior-year levels and net interest for the first half was up one percent year to year.</p>
<p>&quot;We would focus on the improvement in operating performance excluding the restructuring provisions. On this basis pretax profit would have risen 22.5 percent over the prior year and return on equity lifted to 9.7 percent (versus just under seven percent for the whole of 1995),&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Though in the short term the price may be volatile, &quot;...we remain convinced of the longer-term value in this stock&quot;.</p>
<p>Hapoalim's operating trends, on the other hand, were disappointing, Lehman Brothers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bank Hapoalim's first half confirms our feeling that 1996 is turning out to be a tougher year for the bank,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Year to year interest income was down just over three percent, reflecting the tougher margin environment and the impact of higher rates on the bank's bond portfolio.&quot;</p>
<p>On the positive side, equity accounted investments rose 20 percent and the bank had 40.1 million shekels in capital gains in the second quarter. The bank is likely to realise a much more substantial gain on the sale of a portion of investments in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;Return on equity on a core basis has clearly declined and may even have undershot our forecast of 8.9 percent in real terms for the year,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point we do not believe the stock is particularly attractive although longer-term recovery potential suggests that for investors with patience the company could hold some promise.&quot;</p>
