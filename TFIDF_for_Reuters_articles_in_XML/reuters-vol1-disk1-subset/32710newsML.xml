<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS - Office Depot, Staples active.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>After a delayed opening, options on shares of Office Depot and Staples Inc were active on Wednesday after the companies said they would merge in a stock-swap deal.</p>
<p>Traders said the activity in the options ran the gamut as some investors positioned themselves for rises in the stocks and others for pullbacks.</p>
<p>By afternoon, Office Depot shares were up 4-1/2 at 20-3/8. Staples fell 3/4 to 18-3/4. Both traded on heavy volume.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no one single strategy,&quot; a trader on the American Stock Exchange said of Office Depot options trading.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's lots of unwinding, there's lots of new positions,&quot; he said, adding that much of the activity was arbitrage-linked, particularly in the October 20 calls, which traded more than 3,400 contracts.</p>
<p>The October 20 call was up 1-3/16 at 1-5/16.</p>
<p>&quot;People have their own ideas (about the stock) and are doing their own thing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The most active Office Depot option after the October 20 call was the January 1997 20 call, which traded about 1,300 contracts.</p>
<p>It rose 1-5/8 to 2-1/4.  </p>
<p>Trading in the October 20 calls before the deal was announced was thin, with just 15 contracts changing hands on Tuesday and 290 all last week. The open interest through Tuesday was fairly big, at 10,383 contracts.</p>
<p>The Office Depot October 15 call, which was up 3-1/2 at 5-1/4, traded 250 contracts. On Tuesday, 600 contracts traded, but open interest rose by only 298, to 851.</p>
<p>The most active put was the October 20. Recent put trading was also relatively light, traders said.</p>
<p>Staples calls, led by the October 17-1/2, which traded 3,305 contracts, also were busy.  </p>
<p>The Staples December 17-1/2 call traded 1,175 contracts and the September 17-1/2 traded 358. Both the October 20 call and December 15 call traded 255 contracts.</p>
<p>On the put side, the December 17-1/2 was most active, with 150 contracts changing hands.</p>
<p>The two companies said the merger would be a tax-free exchange of shares, with Office Depot holders receiving 1.14 Staples shares for each of their Office Depot shares.</p>
<p>In other activity, an apparent ratio spread was spotted in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The September 25 call traded more than 500 contracts and the January 1997 25 call about 1,100.  </p>
<p>&quot;It looks like they did a ratio spread between the Jan 25s and the Sept 25s. It was probably a two-to-one,&quot; said Michael Schwartz at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The investor likely sold twice as many of the January 25 calls as the September 25 calls, he said.</p>
<p>Schwartz said the investor was likely setting a range beyond which he or she would have exposure to the stock.</p>
<p>The September 25 calls traded at 1-7/8, up 1/8, and the January 25s traded at 2-7/8, up 5/16. Wal-Mart shares were up 1/8 at 26-5/8 in late trade.</p>
