<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has pledged to hold a steady course as President Boris Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery in late November and he demonstrated his resolve with a crackdown on tax dodgers.</p>
<p>After meeting Yeltsin on Tuesday, Chernomyrdin rebuffed opposition politicians looking for chinks in the government's reformist armour, saying there would be no departure from current policies &quot;under any circumstances&quot;.</p>
<p>Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, who met for almost an hour at the Barvikha sanatorium near Moscow, discussed a proposal by the president to consolidate and harmonise Russia's power structures by establishing a &quot;permanent four&quot; group of top officials.</p>
<p>This group, consisting of Chernomyrdin, presidential chief of staff Anatoly Chubais and the heads of the two chambers of parliament, could play an important role in forming policy over the next three months or so while Yeltsin is not fully active.</p>
<p>Leading U.S. cardiologist Michael DeBakey, who is advising Yeltsin's Russian doctors, said in an interview published on Tuesday that the 65-year-old president's condition was improving and he was on track for heart bypass surgery in late November.</p>
<p>The plan to create the &quot;permanent four&quot; group follows a period of Kremlin infighting which culminated in last Thursday's sacking of outspoken and ambitious security chief Alexander Lebed, who was blamed by Yeltsin for rocking the boat and accused by his rivals of plotting a coup.</p>
<p>The &quot;permanent four&quot; includes the communist chairman of the State Duma lower house of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov. But Chernomyrdin made clear that there would be no significant concessions to the opposition that would undermine reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to move away from the main political line which we are following, impossible, impermissible and unacceptable under any circumstances,&quot; said the premier in remarks broadcast by NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>The remarks bore particular significance in the context of wrangling over the 1997 budget, which was rejected by the Duma last week. Deputies doubted that revenue forecasts could be achieved and pointed to a dismal tax collection record.</p>
<p>But Chernomyrdin told a new tax commission -- whose VChK initials are the same in Russian as the Soviet-era secret police of Felix Dzerzhinsky -- that the president and the government were committed to creating conditions for economic growth.</p>
<p>He backed up his tough talk by announcing plans to launch bankruptcy proceedings against four companies that owe large sums to the federal budget.</p>
<p>The premier told Interfax news agency the decision to get tough was &quot;final, but until tomorrow there is still time for them to take the steps to pay off their debts to the budget&quot;. He said the four firms would be named on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Russian companies are technically insolvent, but bankruptcy proceedings have been launched only rarely and big enterprises usually stay in business due to the high social cost of closing them down.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin gave no details of what the practical impact of the latest crackdown might be, but it could result in company restructurings or management shakeups.</p>
