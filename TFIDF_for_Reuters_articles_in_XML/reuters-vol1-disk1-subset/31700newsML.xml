<p>A special U.S. envoy will visit Poland this week to persuade it to supply tanks to Bosnia as part of a Washington plan to strengthen the Bosnian forces, a source close to the Polish arms trade said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The source, who requested anonymity, said U.S. Balkan envoy James Pardew would meet Polish government officials on Friday and try to convince them that the sale should go through despite European Union resistance to the Washington plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to sell the tanks but the matter is delicate,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy in Warsaw confirmed that Pardew was coming but did not reveal the purpose of his visit.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati has said Poland will not provide tanks to Bosnia's army as it had an agreement with EU countries not to sell arms to the region.</p>
<p>But the source said that if Pardew, who was due to visit Germany before coming to Poland, convinced Bonn to participate in the scheme to strengthen the army of the Moslem-Croat Federation, Warsaw would be inclined to follow suit.</p>
<p>Newspapers have reported that at stake is a sale of up to 45 T-72 tanks worth $50 million and that they would be paid for out of a NATO fund created for such purposes.</p>
<p>Last month Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz did not rule out a sale of tanks to Bosnia but said that before any decision the government needed &quot;to know the details of the proposal and the whole undertaking.&quot;</p>
<p>Poland has troops with the NATO-led IFOR forces in Bosnia and diplomats in Warsaw said it did not want to be seen to be equipping one side in Bosnia's still unresolved ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>But Poland's troubled state-owned arms industry is eager for orders and has lobbied strongly for the sale to go through, fearing the deal could go to a rival such as Slovakia.</p>
