<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he expected progress in the stalled peace process with the Palestinians &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister David Levy suggested Netanyahu should meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat &quot;soon&quot;.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was speaking after meeting visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, who urged Israel's right-wing government to revive Middle East peacemaking, dangling the prospect of closer economic ties with Tokyo as a reward.</p>
<p>&quot;We reiterated our commitment to pursue peace, both on the Palestinian track -- in which I expect progress in the coming weeks -- and on the Syrian track, in which we reissued our invitation to Syria to resume the talks,&quot; Netanyahu told a joint news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I was...left with the impression that there will be concrete progress made in the context of the Palestinian track soon,&quot; Ikeda said.</p>
<p>Neither man specified the nature of possible movement in Israeli-PLO talks, expected to resume early next month.</p>
<p>Asked by Israel's Channel One television if thought a Netanyahu-Arafat meeting needed to be held soon, Levy said:</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly there is a need. What else? Did someone think that I, as foreign minister, a member of this government, went to meet Arafat as a one-time thing, or a personal matter, or without the prime minister's knowledge?&quot;</p>
<p>In recent days several figures in Netanyahu's Likud party have pressed the premier to make a decision over a personal meeting with Arafat, viewed by rightists as a &quot;terrorist&quot;.</p>
<p>Levy is the only member of Netanyahu's religious right coalition government to have met Arafat since Netanyahu defeated Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres in May elections,</p>
<p>Later on Monday a Japanese delegation headed by Foreign Ministry Director General Seii Chiro Noboro met Palestinian officials at PLO East Jerusalem headquarters at Orient House.</p>
<p>Successive Israeli governments have opposed such visits, viewing Orient House as the spearhead of Arab efforts to establish sovereignty in East Jerusalem, claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>But Netanyahu has taken a tougher line on Palestinian activities in Jerusalem than the government he ousted, which turned a blind eye to PLO offices in the eastern half of the city it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed.</p>
<p>Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The city's fate is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Palestinians are closely watching Netanyahu for signs he will give green lights to a long-delayed army pullback from the still-occupied West Bank flashpoint of Hebron, and to a face-to-face meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, noting that Japan is Israel's second biggest trading partner, said he expected a substantial increase in trade and joint ventures between the two nations.</p>
<p>Japan is the main donor nation aiding Arafat's Palestinian Authority and a participant in multilateral Middle East talks.</p>
<p>On Sunday in self-ruled Gaza, Ikeda said he had invited Arafat to visit Japan from September 10 to 13.</p>
