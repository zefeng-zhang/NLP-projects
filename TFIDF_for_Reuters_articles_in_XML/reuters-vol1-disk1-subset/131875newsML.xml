<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Aborigines campaign to stop ERA mine.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Aborigines campaign to stop ERA mine.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Aborigines opposed to a new uranium mine by Energy Resources of Australia Ltd near the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory on Monday began a campaign to gain support from unions and environmentalists.</p>
<p>&quot;Our community are fringe dwellers in the shadow of commercial gain,&quot; said Jacqui Katona, executive officer for the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sacrificed country before, we can not be asked to sacrifice again,&quot; Katona said at a press conference in Sydney.  </p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders from the three clans which cover the proposed Jabiluka mine site and ERA's existing Ranger uranium mine will tour Australia's main eastern states meeting with unions, environmental groups and politicians.</p>
<p>The Aboriginal leaders said they opposed any further uranium mining on their land because previous mines had brought social dislocation to their people. The 1,000-odd Aborigines suffer a high rate of alcoholism and unemployment.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have no desire to see any more country ripped up and further negative intrusions on our lives,&quot; said the leaders in a statement. &quot;Our future depends on our culture remaining strong. Our cultural values cannot be traded for money.&quot;</p>
<p>They also said that any further mining would threaten the environmentally sensitive Kakadu National Park, which has been World Heritage listed by the Australian government.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1978, this whole area was under water in the wet season,&quot; said Katona. &quot;If there is a spill on a road, they can't guarantee they can clean it up.&quot;  </p>
<p>Environmentalists oppose the mine as it borders Kakadu. They also oppose uranium mining in general.</p>
<p>ERA hopes to begin initial work on the Jabiluka Number Two deposit, which contains 90,400 tonnes of uranium oxide, in 1997.</p>
<p>ERA produced about 3,500 tonnes of uranium oxide at its Ranger operation last year but expects to lift output to 5,000 tonnes by next July when it expands its Ranger mine.</p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders are seeking meetings with Australia's resources and environment ministers in an attempt to get the government to stop any further mining.  </p>
<p>But Australia's conservative Liberal-National coalition government, elected in March, has already overturned the previous Labor administration's uranium policy, which limited Australia to three mines.</p>
<p>ERA has said it is looking to increase sales of uranium to France, the world's biggest uranium buyer after Paris endorsed a ban on tests of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Rival miner RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd is seeking to develop the Kintyre uranium deposit in Western Australia, located on the edge of the remote Great Sandy Desert, adjacent to the Ruddall River National Park, Australia's largest park.  </p>
<p>WMC Ltd also plans to lift uranium production from its Olympic Dam operation in South Australia to around 3,700 tonnes from 1,500 currently.</p>
