<p>China said on Sunday that prospects were bleak for progress at the next round of talks in Geneva on its proposal to join the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>It also said the United States was being inflexible on conditions for its entry to the organisation and that it saw little hope of a change in Washington's stance soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't foresee any decision at the meeting -- probably none,&quot; Li Zhongzhou, an official at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation was quoted as saying in the Business Weekly.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor are we convinced the United States will soon turn flexible in its demands on the conditions for China's entry to the organisation.&quot;</p>
<p>China has been seeking to join the global trade organisation on easier terms with developing country status, but Western nations, including the United States, have maintained that its economy is too big for such treatment. A working group will meet later this year in Geneva to try to iron out the differences.  </p>
<p>Analysts said earlier this week that China looked set to replace Japan as the biggest source of U.S. trade deficits and commercial frictions that Washington may find far more difficult to resolve, trade analysts say.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported this week that for the first time, the U.S. trade deficit with China in June surpassed the shortfall with Japan.</p>
