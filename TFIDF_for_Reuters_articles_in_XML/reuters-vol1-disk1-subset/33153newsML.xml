<p>Two Swedes, one of them a senior diplomat, have been expelled from Russia for alleged spying, the Swedish news agency TT reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Swedish authorities refused early comment on the affair.</p>
<p>TT quoted Russian media as saying the man was alleged to have been spying in St. Petersburg, Russia's second city. A Swedish diplomat had also been expelled, the agency added.</p>
<p>TT reported that the Swedish man had been arrested in February and had confessed to spying. He and the diplomat had already left Russia, the agency added.</p>
<p>The Russian Interfax news agency quoted Boris Kostenko, head of the information department of the Federal Security Service, as saying a Swedish military intelligence agent had been unmasked in February.</p>
<p>&quot;He confirmed that last winter Hans Peter Nordstrem, a go-between for the Swedish military intelligence, and a Russian citizen who had been engaged by the intelligence earlier had been detained,&quot; Interfax said from Moscow.</p>
<p>Kostenko said diplomatic channels had been used after the investigation to make Sweden &quot;withdraw the senior diplomat from Russia&quot;.</p>
<p>Kostenko refused to name the Russian agent or the Swedish diplomat or give the exact date when the latter had left Russia.</p>
<p>The Russian Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily newspaper said Nordstrem, a businessman born in 1964, had entered Russia on February 21 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;According to certain sources his company had been set up by the Swedish military intelligence for covert operations in Russia,&quot; Nezavisimaya said.</p>
