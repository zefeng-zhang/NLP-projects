<p>Electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG on Tuesday said net profit in the first nine months of 1996 had risen 24 percent and the economic slowdown in Western Europe was apparently levelling off.</p>
<p>ABB does not expect the improvement in Europe's economy to translate into higher demand for the group within the next 12 months because its investment goods business is always late in the business cycle.</p>
<p>However, demand from emerging markets for ABB's power and industrial products continues to expand and cost-cutting programmes will continue to influence results positively, ABB said in its nine month report.</p>
<p>ABB's sales in the January to end-September period rose three percent to $24.08 billion and net profit rose 24 percent to $809 million.</p>
<p>The result was slightly above forecasts for $805 million and ABB's shares firmed three francs in early trading to 1,581 francs on the Swiss exchange as dealers noted the rise in profits and orders.</p>
<p>Orders received in the first nine months rose slightly to $25.4 billion from $25.3 billion and the order backlog by the end of September had risen slightly to $33.9 billion from $33.5 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>ABB's results reflect the creation of the transportation venture Adtranz with Daimler-Benz AG last year. ABB's 50 percent share of this venture represents a smaller business than the former 100-percent owned transportation activities.</p>
<p>On a comparable basis, i.e. excluding transportation activities, orders and sales had risen seven percent.</p>
<p>The increase in orders was led by the booking of several large power generation projects in the first half of the year, increased activity in oil, gas and petrochemicals, and growth in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The large Bakun hydroelectric project in Malaysia, recently awarded to ABB, is not yet reflected in the group's orders.</p>
<p>ABB repeated that it still expects net profit for the full 1996 year to exceed 1995's net profit on a comparable basis.</p>
<p>In 1995 ABB reported a net profit of $1.315 billion, but this result was inflated by a one-time payment of $250 million from Daimler-Benz in connection with the creation of Adtranz.</p>
<p>Excluding this payment, ABB would have reported a net profit of $1.065 billion in 1995.  </p>
<p>ABB's Barnevik sees good Q4, but tough 1997 =2</p>
<p>Barnevik declined to comment further on ABB's forecast for the full year, which calls for an increase in 1996 profits from 1995 on a comparable basis.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we had a pretty good fourth quarter last year, we expect this quarter to also be pretty good,&quot; Barnevik said.</p>
<p>Barnevik will be leaving the office of chief executive and president at the end of this year, but will remain chairman.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 1995, ABB reported a net profit of $664 million as compared with the $651 million reported in the first nine months of the year.</p>
<p>Fourth quarter operating earnings amounted to $1,254 million compared with $2,021 reported in the first nine months.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter Barnevik also expects the first booking of orders from Malaysia's Bakun hydrolectric dam project, the largest order ever awarded to ABB.</p>
<p>ABB has estimated that its share of the approximate $5.5 billion Bakun project exceeds $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>While some of the order will be booked in the current quarter, the remaining will be booked next year, Barnevik said.</p>
<p>Long-term Barnevik said ABB's outlook was &quot;quite bright,&quot; noting the substantial jump in profits that ABB has experienced during recent business cycles.</p>
<p>Between 1988 and 1990 operating profits rose to $1,790 million from $854 million and between 1993 and 1995 operating profits rose to $3,275 from $2,181 million.</p>
<p>This year and next ABB is feeling the effects of Western Europe's sluggish economy.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997 have to look for a more tough year with respect to demand,&quot; Barnevik said.</p>
<p>But by 1998 ABB expects the current improvement in Western Europe's economy to help its business, which is a typical late-cycle business.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect 1998 to have improving demand for goods in Europe, plus have the combined impact from emerging markets and North America. So we can make a substantial jump,&quot; Barnevik said.</p>
