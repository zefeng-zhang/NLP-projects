<p>Japan's general election created only a small ripple in financial markets on Monday after the pro-business Liberal Democrats boosted their strength in parliament but failed to clinch a clear majority.</p>
<p>Markets generally shrugged off the outcome as it signalled more-of-the-same coalition politics in Japan, with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto likely to stay at the helm in an alliance with smaller parties.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected to see few policy changes.</p>
<p>The stock market, which had rallied last week on the expectation that Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would increase its parliamentary presence, slipped slightly in Monday morning trading as light profit-taking set in.</p>
<p>&quot;The market had factored in the election results, which mean a virtual LDP victory, to some extent,&quot; said a broker at a major Japanese securities house.</p>
<p>By mid-session, the key 225-share Nikkei average had fallen by 73.47 points or 0.34 percent to 21,538.83 in lacklustre trading dominated by technical position adjustments.</p>
<p>Turnover was about 115 million shares at midday, compared with 195 million by Friday midday.</p>
<p>The dollar, meanwhile, edged up to a morning high of 112.85 yen, its highest level since January 1994, buoyed by active yen sales for sterling and Australian dollar.</p>
<p>But Tokyo traders largely ignored the results of Sunday's vote, in which the LDP captured 239 seats, slightly short of the 251 it needed to govern alone in the 500-seat Lower House, but 28 more than in the last election in 1993.</p>
<p>Tokyo traders said Hashimoto was likely to maintain current monetary and currency policies designed to put the nation's tentative economic recovery on a firmer footing.</p>
<p>Some stock brokers and analysts said they still need to see the framework of the new coalition and what new policies the government will formulate to prop up the economy.</p>
<p>Shinichi Ichikawa, strategist at Credit Lyonnais Securities, said a new government is expected to be stable, but it is not likely to arouse much reformist fervour as in the last election three years ago, which threw the LDP out of office for the first time in the postwar period.</p>
<p>The LDP returned to government around a year later as the dominant member of a three-way coalition.</p>
<p>The drop in stock prices, however, buoyed Japanese government bond futures.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks were expected to rise after the elections, but they have been weak this morning, and this has created buying pressure for the December,&quot; said a trader for the securities unit of a trust bank. December yen bond futures stood at 123.27 by midday, up sharply from Friday's 122.84.</p>
<p>Yen bond traders detected no big impact from the poll.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there will be much effect on the market,&quot; said Hidenobu Furuhashi, bond department manager at Toyo Trust Securities. He said that with the LDP's strong showing in Sunday's vote, a rise in the consumption tax would become a certainty. The tax is due to be raised to five percent from the current three percent next April.</p>
<p>Such a rise would probably prevent a slackening of the supply and demand balance in the Japanese government bond market, since new bond issues would likely be fewer than if the consumption tax was kept steady at three percent, he said.</p>
