<p>A century by Darryll Cullinan helped South Africa to a 27-run victory over India to maintain their unbeaten run in the Titan Cup triangular one-day series at Jaipur's Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Put into bat by Indian skipper Sachin Tendulkar, who won the toss, South Africa scored 249 for six and then restricted India to 222 for seven in 50 overs.</p>
<p>Having won all their three matches so far in the round-robin league, they lead the standings with six points and seem assured of a place in the final on November 6.</p>
<p>India have one win from three games and Australia have lost both their matches.</p>
<p>For South Africa, man-of-the-match Cullinan scored 106 off 124 balls and starred in a 113-run third wicket partnership with skipper Hansie Cronje, who scored 58 from 73 balls.</p>
<p>Tendulkar and left-handed Saurav Ganguly made a solid yet relatively slow start for India with a 126-run first-wicket stand, however India's middle-order failed to capitalise on their groundwork.</p>
<p>Tendulkar (64 off 93 balls), going for a big hit, was caught by Gary Kirsten at deep mid-on off medium-pacer Brian McMillan. With his next delivery McMillan had Rahul Dravid caught behind. He finished with three for 32 from nine overs.</p>
<p>Paceman Allan Donald uprooted the off stump of Ganguly (54 off 104 balls) with a yorker.</p>
<p>Mohammed Azharuddin waged a lone battle to remain unbeaten on 56 from 60 balls but found his team mates heading back in a procession in their effort to step up the run rate.</p>
<p>Javagal Srinath, Ajay Jadeja, Pankaj Dharmani and Anil Kumble fell attempting wild strokes.</p>
<p>&quot;The bowlers did a great job in pegging down the Indian batsmen,&quot; Cronje said. &quot;The Indian openers kept them in the game and we were beginning to get worried until Tendulkar got out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cullinan played a gallant knock to enable us post a fighting score,&quot; he said.</p>
