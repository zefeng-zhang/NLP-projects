<p>Dutch brewer Grolsch NV posted an 11 percent rise in first half profits on Wednesday and said full year net would increase despite a cooler summer in northern Europe tempering the thirst for premium beer.</p>
<p>The figures from the brewer famous for its pilsner beer in swing-top bottles were bang in line with analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>First half net came in at 21.0 million guilders versus a previous 18.9 million guilders, giving net per share of 1.32 guilders versus 1.16 guilders in the 1995 first half.</p>
<p>Grolsch, which specializes exclusively in beer, said profits were given extra fizz from favourable developments in the home market and strong growth in export sales, interests in Poland and its joint venture with Britain's Bass.</p>
<p>Grolsch holds a 51 percent stake in Grolsch UK, a joint venture with Bass which brews Grolsch premium beer under license and markets, distributes and sells the brand in the U.K.</p>
<p>Analysts said the figures contained few surprises.</p>
<p>&quot;My first impression is that it's exactly in line with my expectations,&quot; said Robeco's Arie Gravendeel. Analysts had forecast net profit of 19.8 to 22.5 million guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm keeping my hold recommendation and forecast of net per share of 3.94 guilders for the whole of 1996,&quot; Gravendeel added.</p>
<p>The Dutch beer market was slightly flatter this summer compared with last year, Grolsch said, after the tropical weather in July and August 1995 had beer drinkers across Europe guzzling lager in greater quantities.</p>
<p>The brewer said the Dutch market would contract in the second half year versus the same 1995 period as a result.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no secret that the Dutch beer market would show some decrease due to the extreme weather situation last year, so there's no real surprise there,&quot; Gravendeel said.</p>
<p>Grolsch added group sales costs and interest charges would increase in the second half, but said all this would be offset by growing market share in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&quot;We also expect an ongoing rise in export volume (from Dutch breweries) and an increase in the sales of our foreign associates,&quot; Grolsch said in a statement.</p>
<p>Six-month turnover increased to 319.9 million guilders from a previous 260.1 million guilders, with operating profit up to 35.5 million guilders from 29.5 million.</p>
<p>Grolsch has plants in the Netherlands and the U.K. -- Ruddles Brewing Company -- and also has collaborative agreements in distribution in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the U.S.</p>
<p>In Poland, Grolsch has a 25 percent stake and a controlling vote in Brewpole, which owns 100 percent of Hevelius and 51 percent of Elbrewery that have a combined 18 percent market share.</p>
<p>Grolsch shares opened up 0.30 guilders at 70.30 on the Amsterdam bourse after the results but volume was muted. By 0915 GMT the stock was unchanged from Tuesday's close at 70.00 guilders.</p>
