<headline>RTRS-ANI directors' futures unresolved.</headline>

<p>Shareholders of Australian National Industries Ltd continued their lengthy annual meeting on Monday with the future of sparring directors unresolved.</p>
<p>The re-election of Peter Joseph and Ross Palmer to the ANIO board will be determined by a poll of shareholders with the outcome on each vote unlikely to be known before Tuesday morning, chairman Ted Harris told the meeting.</p>
<p>Palmer and Joseph took up a shareholders suggestion after nearly three hours of inconclusive debate &quot;to get out the back for five minutes,&quot; to resolve their differences in a concillary fashion with Harris in attendance.  </p>
<p>The unexpected meeting between Palmer and Joseph ended after 20 minutes with them shaking hands but refusing to withdraw their motions of sacking each other.</p>
<p>Palmer, the largest personal shareholder in ANI with a stake of about five percent, has criticised Joseph and some other directors for their handling of the purchase of German environmental waste business ABT by its Holter unit of Germany.</p>
<p>Joseph, an independent director along with Palmer, has institutional support for Palmer's removal from the board, according to various fund managers and newspaper reports. Joseph has said he will resign immediately if Palmer is re-elected.  </p>
<p>Joseph is himself facing a motion brought by Palmer to be dismissed from the board but his re-eletion has received the support of Harris and managing director Peter Stancliffe.</p>
<p>ANI reported a loss of A$213.19 million for the year to June 30 compared with a profit of A$80.38 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>At 3.35 p.m. (0535 GMT), ANI shares were two cents lower at A$1.22 on a turnover of 2.92 million shares.</p>
