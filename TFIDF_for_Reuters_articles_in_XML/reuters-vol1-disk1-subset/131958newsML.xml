<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end up, spot down.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end up, spot down.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly up on Monday for the fifth straight trading day due to the surging domestic A share markets and continued new share issues this week, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active three-day contract rocketed to 27.00 percent from 8.50 percent last Friday.</p>
<p>Combined turnover surged to 11.9 million lots from 7.88 million. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>&quot;Securities houses and brokerages borrowed large amounts of money due to the active A share markets,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The thee-day contract was especially active due to new issues.&quot;  </p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index rose by 2.65 percent on Monday and its Shenzhen counterpart by 5.16 percent.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, three companies are launching initial offerings in A shares from Monday to Wedneday.</p>
<p>Traders expect the repo rates to move in narrow ranges early this week due to new share issues but fall after the issues end with liquidity returning to the repo market.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly down on Monday with trading volume remaining at a low level with liquidity flowing out into the A share markets, traders said.  </p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market rose slightly to 1.12 million lots from 1.11 million.</p>
<p>The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006, regarded as a market barometer, closed little changed at 122.08 yuan from 122.05 yuan.</p>
<p>&quot;Major institutions have abandoned the T-bill spot market, pulling out funds to speculate in the A share markets,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The market has lost support and the contracts are likely to consolidate at the current levels in the short term.&quot;</p>
