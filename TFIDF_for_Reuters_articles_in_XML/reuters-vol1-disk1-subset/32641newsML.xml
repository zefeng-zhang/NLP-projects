<p>CMS Energy Corp's global strategy leaped forward as major projects advanced in India and Latin America this week, chairman and chief executive officer William McCormick said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The company's independent power unit, CMS Generation Co, said Wednesday the government of India gave the final nod to its power generating project in Jegurupadu, Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an important flagship project for us,&quot; said McCormick, who added that having a strong local partner helped advance the approval process.  </p>
<p>CMS Generation holds an 18.75-percent ownership stake and is operator of the GVK Industries project in India. The plant's gas-fueled turbine began operation last month and should be generating 235 megawatts of electricity by next spring.</p>
<p>&quot;We have plans to double that to 470 megawatts over the next several years,&quot; McCormick said. &quot;When the plant goes up to full operation, it should produce revenues of about $150 million a year,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, CMS Energy's gas pipeline unit, CMS Gas Transmission and Storage, was joined by NOVA Corp of Canada as a partner in the $700 million Atacama Pipeline project to ship natural gas to Chile from Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;We also expect to build a 400 megawatt natural gas power plant in Chile and hope to begin construction next year on that,&quot; McCormick said. &quot;And we're negotiating now and will probably be adding one additional partner, this one from Chile.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides NOVA, CMS also has an Argentine partner, ASTRA, on the pipeline project.  </p>
<p>McCormick said global expansion is part of the strategy of Jackson, Michigan-based CMS. In five years he expects international business to account for 35 to 40 percent of its revenue, up from 20 percent now.</p>
<p>Besides building a presence in South America and India, the company has various energy projects under way or in development in Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;There are tremendous growth opportunities for energy companies like ourselves who provide a full range of capabilities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked about the overall earnings picture for CMS, McCormick said, &quot;We're on track with the consensus for the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The First Call mean estimate is $2.42 per share for 1996. In 1995, the company earned $2.27 per share.</p>
