<title>JAPAN: Tokyo precious metals end firmer on weak yen.</title>

<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended mostly firmer on Monday, buoyed by the yen's weakness against the dollar, while spot gold prices slipped slightly from the New York close last Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from four to seven yen per gram firmer. Most-active August 1997 gold settled five yen firmer at 1,361 yen per gram.</p>
<p>Bullion was quoted a tad easier at $379.65/380.15 per ounce at 0728 GMT, compared with $380.10/50 in New York last Friday.</p>
<p>Gains in yen-based gold futures were capped by private investors' long liquidation and weaker spot gold prices.  </p>
<p>Activity in the bullion market was lacklustre due partly to a market holiday in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Traders tended to take a mildly bearish view of the bullion market, saying that recent strong U.S. stock prices would continue to put a downward pressure on the bullion market.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the U.S. stocks firm, gold is unlikely to tread firmer. Gold may test support at $377.5 in the near term,&quot; a trading house trader said.</p>
<p>Open interest in gold futures has been on a downward trend, as private investors were tending to close their positions and refraining from fresh buying, they said.  </p>
<p>Despite the weak yen, fresh buying interest in precious metal futures remained limited as weak metal prices were likely to offset gains in yen-based prices.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed as high as 112.89 yen during the day, its highest level since January 1994.</p>
<p>TOCOM benchmark August platinum ended seven higher at 1,380 yen per gram, while other months were four to seven higher.</p>
<p>TOCOM August palladium settled five yen firmer at 422 yen per gram, in an attempt to correct recent falls.</p>
<p>August silver ended up 0.7 yen at 180.0 yen per 10 grams.</p>
