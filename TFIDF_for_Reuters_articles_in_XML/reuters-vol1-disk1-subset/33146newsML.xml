<p>A leading member of France's ruling centre-right coalition accused President Jacques Chirac in unusually harsh language on Wednesday of duping voters by betraying campaign promises.</p>
<p>Former health minister Simone Veil of the junior coalition partner Union for French Democracy (UDF) said Chirac had made promises on issues including poverty and the homeless in last year's campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;But we immediately went into a period of austerity. The French felt duped,&quot; she said in an interview on Radio Shalom.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, the French sometimes feel that the statements and the measures were different. They don't always see the continuity and coherence in decisions,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Veil said replacing the Gaullist prime minister, Alain Juppe, would have little impact. She called for an easing of the criteria for a single European currency.</p>
<p>Juppe, under fire for his government's austerity policies in face of a weak economy and high unemployment, lunched on Wednesday with one of his most dogged coalition critics and rivals, National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin.</p>
<p>After the latest in a series of meetings to rally his fractious powerbase, Juppe told reporters it had been &quot;very good, very friendly...We spoke a bit about our holidays and we discussed this autumn's problems.</p>
<p>&quot;I naturally gave him information on tax reform and the budget and we spoke about other subjects,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>Seguin, however, stayed tight-lipped.</p>
<p>In his latest barbed shot at the government, Seguin had called last Saturday for &quot;real audacity on economic and social issues&quot;.</p>
<p>The meetings follow close on the heels of a similar round of political fence-mending by Chirac in late July and early August.</p>
<p>There is widespread public gloom over near-record unemployment and unrest threatens over plans to slash public deficits to help qualify for European monetary union from 1999.</p>
<p>The economy shrank 0.4 percent in the second quarter compared with the first, underlining the difficulty of cutting the budget deficit, data released on Wednesday showed.</p>
