<p>Poor distribution of U.S. two-year notes auctioned Tuesday spilled over into the swap market on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Treasury dealers were said to be selling the new two-year note and buying older issues Wednesday, creating a yield gap of three to five basis points between the previous on-the-run note and the new note which settles October 31.</p>
<p>Swaps done off the old note, yielding 5.93 percent, will be marked against the new note, yielding about 5.96 to 5.97 percent.  </p>
<p>On a swap where a dealer recieves a fixed rate of 17 basis points over the old note, say 6.10 percent, the position would be marked against swaps off the new note at 6.13 to 6.15 percent if the swap spread was unchanged.</p>
<p>To avoid that predictable loss, dealers have chopped spreads on two-year swaps.</p>
<p>On two-year LIBOR swaps, spreads were quoted at 13 to 14 basis points bid, 15 to 17 basis points offered, about three to five basis points tighter than already historically tight levels before the auction.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, five- and 10-year swap spreads remained tight on business generated by dollar-denominated fixed-rate bond issues being swapped to floating.</p>
<p>On five-year swaps, spreads were quoted at 22 basis points bid, 24 to 25 basis points offered, about one basis point tighter than Monday's levels.</p>
<p>New five-year notes will be auctioned later on Wednesday. At midday, the yield gap between the current on-the-run issue and the new issue was less than one basis point.</p>
<p>On 10-year swaps, spreads were quoted at 31 basis points bid, 32 to 33 basis points offered, close to Monday's quotes.  </p>
<p>Some dealers had hoped a repo special would develop on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing spreads wider.</p>
<p>The 10-year repo borrowing rate this week has made a few moves below three percent, compared to about 5-1/2 percent for general overnight borrowing, but the special has not had the staying power necessary to move swap rates.</p>
<p>Spreads on three-year swaps were quoted at 18 basis points bid, 21 basis points offered, slightly tighter than earlier in the week.</p>
