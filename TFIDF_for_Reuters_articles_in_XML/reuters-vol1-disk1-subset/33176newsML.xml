<title>FRANCE: French relief groups urge wider protection zone.</title>

<p>Seven French relief and human rights groups on Wednesday condemned an Iraqi offensive against Kurdish rebels and urged Western allies to turn the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone into a wider protective region banning all attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Several witnesses have reported arbitrary executions, massive arrests and pillage in Arbil (in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq),&quot; a joint statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the risks incurred, several of the (signatory) non-governmental organisations have had to repatriate or withdraw their teams,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The signatories included medical charity Medecins du Monde, France-Libertes headed by Danielle Mitterrand, widow of the late French president, and the religious group CIMADE, which cares for immigrants.</p>
<p>The groups were concerned Iraqi forces might attack the Kurdish stronghold of Sulaimaniya, the last remaining major Iraqi city held by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. They said millions of Kurdish refugees could flee the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;We recall that the Iraqi regime has never ceased committing serious abuses and we demand that the protection zone spread to Kurdish regions located below the 36th parallel, and include military attacks other than by air,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Washington, backed by Britain, has decreed an enlarged no-fly zone in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>France, one of the 1991 Gulf War allies, is one of four nations -- along with Britain, Turkey and Washington -- that has been enforcing a no-fly zone in northern Iraq intended to protect Kurds living there from Iraqi attack.</p>
