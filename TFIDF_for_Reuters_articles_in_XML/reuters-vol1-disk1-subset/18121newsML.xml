<p>Lloyd's of London said on Wednesday it had been swamped by U.S. investors signing up for its recovery plan after a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that had threatened the insurance market's survival.</p>
<p>When staff arrived at Lloyd's headquarters in London's financial district just hours before the original deadline for acceptance of the recovery plan, its fax machines had been whirring for nearly 12 hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Acceptances from the U.S. have been flooding in overnight. Clearly a lot of Names felt inhibited by the judgment,&quot; said a spokesman, referring to U.S. judge Robert Payne's decision last Friday to allow U.S. Names more time to consider the plan.</p>
<p>Payne granted an injunction giving U.S. Names, or investors, more time to consider the plan and ordered Lloyd's to provide further information by September 23.</p>
<p>This ruling was overturned on Tuesday by a panel of judges in Baltimore, who sent the case back to the Virginia district court with orders to dismiss it.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Lloyd's offices in London and nearby Chatham had been deluged with hundreds of acceptance forms, but was unable to give a number. Lloyd's was not expected to publish a new count of acceptances before Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Over the last few days, evidence of support for the Lloyd's recovery proposals among its 34,000 investors worldwide has grown considerably, with the latest count putting acceptance at 82 percent as of Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>But almost half of the 2,700 United States Names had until last night held off. Only 53 percent had accepted, according to Tuesday's figures.</p>
<p>Wednesday's deadline of noon London time for accepting the recovery plan, under which Lloyd's proposes Names pay to help reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas, still officially stands.</p>
<p>But Lloyd's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday there would be some form of limited extension, so that Names who have not accepted could do so.</p>
<p>This will crucially allow the market enough time to collect the convincing majority of acceptances, especially from U.S. Names, which it needs to prove its own solvency.</p>
<p>Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a destructive combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds</p>
<p>Long-standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses.</p>
<p>The market is due to submit figures to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry next week in an annual solvency test, and file with the U.S. Treasury and New York Insurance Department later next month.</p>
<p>Equitas may lift off in two weeks if all goes as planned. The recovery plan's success increasingly looks likely, but another challenge by U.S. Names has not been ruled out.</p>
<p>However, U.S. legal sources said overnight that, while U.S. investors could in theory attempt to challenge Tuesday's order it would be difficult to do so successfully.</p>
<p>Despite that, one U.S. Name and chief negotiator for an action group known as the American Names Association, Kenneth Chiate, said he expected Names to appeal the Baltimore ruling. -- London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7721</p>
