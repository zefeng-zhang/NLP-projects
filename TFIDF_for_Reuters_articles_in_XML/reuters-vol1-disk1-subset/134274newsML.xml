<title>SWITZERLAND: ILO sets new labor, wage standards for seafarers.</title>
<headline>ILO sets new labor, wage standards for seafarers.</headline>
<dateline>GENEVA 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>New rules governing the working conditions of one million seafarers worldwide as well as ship inspections were agreed on Tuesday, the International Labour Organisation said.</p>
<p>The new standards should lead to improved safety in a hazardous industry plagued by accidents often caused by human error and fatigue, according to experts.</p>
<p>Three conventions, three non-binding recommendations and a protocol to the 1976 Merchant Shipping Convention were adopted by 85 member states representing the bulk of the world's shipping industry, who attended a two-week ILO maritime session.</p>
<p>Conventions require two ratifications to enter into force.</p>
<p>The new ILO minimum wage recommendation for able seamen was raised to $435 per month as of Jan. l, 1998, up from the previous global benchmark of $385 per month set in 1994.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based United Nations agency promotes social justice and internationally recognised labour rights.</p>
<p>About 180 ships of more than 500 tons have been lost at sea since the last ILO meeting in 1994, causing the death of 1,200 seafarers and many passengers, ILO director-general Michel Hansenne said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a concern worldwide over the operation of sub-standard ships,&quot; Michael Hubbard, a Canadian official who chaired the talks in Geneva, told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Tankers have run ashore spilling oil, passenger ships have sunk with considerable loss of life and other ships have simply disappeared at sea, Hubbard said.</p>
<p>&quot;Eighty-per cent of all shipping casualties are a result of human error. A lot of human error is probably caused from fatigue, long hours of work, insufficient hours of rest, and too much pressure on seamen,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Hours of rest will be increased and hours of work will be more tightly controlled than before.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the new convention and recommendation, ratifying member states acknowledge that work shall be based on an eight-hour day with one day of rest per week. Maximum limits shall not exceed 14 hours per day and 72 hours in a week.</p>
