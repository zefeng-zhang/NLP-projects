<title>MEXICO: Mexican stocks close strong on speculation.</title>
<headline>Mexican stocks close strong on speculation.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks closed nearly two percent higher Wednesday, bolstered by speculative buying of industrial and construction stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Construction stocks were in demand again due to construction spending outlined in the state of the nation speech (on Sunday), but volume was thin,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>The IPC index of blue-chip stocks closed 63 points or 1.93 percent higher to 3,329.99 points.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Zedillo in his state of the nation speech pledged an estimated 14 billion pesos for restructuring highway finances hit by the 1994 peso devaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt the market was very speculative ahead of U.S. unemployment data, which are what will determine stock market behaviour in the U.S. and Mexico next week,&quot; said a trader from the BBV-Probursa brokerage.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor will release unemployment data for August on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. bond market is reflecting expectations of the unemployment data, which may push yields up,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond closed at 7.10 percent, up from 7.08 percent in early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Buying was partly due to foreign investors who are very liquid from the (stock) boom of some weeks ago, but are very selective when they enter the market,&quot; the BBV-Probursa trader said.</p>
<p>A total of 96 stocks changed hands, 57 of which gained and 18 lost, with the remaining 21 unchanged. Volume was light at 69.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Heavily-weighted Telmex L series shares closed up 34 centavos at 12.74 pesos.</p>
<p>According to the James Capel brokerage, the IPC has a resistance, in dollar terms, at 455 points. (corrects figure.)</p>
