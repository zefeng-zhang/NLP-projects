<p>The following are some of the leading stories in Finnish papers this morning.</p>
<p>HELSINGIN SANOMAT</p>
<p>- Centre Party takes victory in Sunday's municipal and European Parliament elections. Conservatives advance, Greens lose, &quot;Young Finns&quot; go nowhere.</p>
<p>- Biggest explanatory factor for changes in elections seems to be low voter turnout (around 60 percent), which the Centre Party avoided better than the others -- editorial column.</p>
<p>- Europoll victory especially sweet for Centre Party as it had feared its voters' might have grown passive because of Finland's EU membership -- editorial.</p>
<p>- Topping list of election winners is (Centre Party's) Paavo Vayrynen, who got what he wanted: &quot;a basis for a return to the front ranks of Finnish politics&quot; -- editorial.</p>
<p>- Almost half Finnish young people view tax evasion in a postive light, while 20 percent of the population admit to paying for illegal services, statistics show.</p>
<p>- Traditional divide between women's and men's jobs still strong. While some women have crossed over to male-dominated sectors, there has been little movement in the other direction.</p>
<p>KAUPPALEHTI</p>
<p>- Short-term interest-bearing funds have quickly absorbed almost all loose money on the market. During past 12 months, almost 2.7 billion markka has accumulated in these funds.</p>
<p>- Foods and feed group Raision Tehtaat has no big expectations for major earnings improvement in 1997 -- says its cholesterol-reducing Benecol margarine is long-term investment.</p>
<p>- Finnish listed companies more tight-lipped about their financing risks than their Swedish counterparts.</p>
<p>DEMARI</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen says linking markka to ERM did not have a negative impact on his Social Democratic Party's performance in the EU elections.</p>
<p>- Officials would like to make Finland a leading European country in fishing tourism.</p>
<p>AAMULEHTI</p>
<p>- Finns elected 16 representatives to Strasbourg-based Euro-parliament, returning only four incumbents in poll tinged with ERM protest. Most surprising winner: Centre's Samuli Pohjamo.</p>
<p>- Biggest election disappointment was the low turnout -- editorial.</p>
<p>TURUN SANOMAT</p>
<p>- Mainstream politicians fared better in Europarliament vote than the &quot;celebrity&quot; candidates.</p>
