<p>Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates opened the door on Monday to a partial lifting of the ban on British beef exports if Britain agreed to speed up the slaughter of cattle in some regions to fight mad cow disease.</p>
<p>In a piece of good news for Britain, which recently angered its EU partners by refusing to implement a previously agreed plan to cull 147,000 cattle most at risk, Yates said a regional approach might be acceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;We would favour - but this is a matter for Britain to propose - a regional approach whereby the accelerated cull could go ahead, perhaps in Northern Ireland, and thereby allowing a regional lifting of the ban to be considered,&quot; Yates told a news conference in Paris, where he was attending an international food fair.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the Florence agreement there is a clear procedure set out. Britain must produce a working document to show the implementation of their eradication plan,&quot; added Yates, the current chairman of the farm Council.</p>
<p>British officials had first raised the question last week of a possible regional easing of the plan to kill 147,000 cattle most at risk from mad cow disease. British Ministry of Agriculture officials had questioned whether herds certified to be freed of the disease might be spared in some regions.</p>
<p>Farm commissioner Franz Fischler insisted as recently as Friday, however, that Britain must carry out the full cull.</p>
