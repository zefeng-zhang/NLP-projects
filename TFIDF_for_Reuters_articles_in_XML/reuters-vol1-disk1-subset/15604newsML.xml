<title>SWITZERLAND: Roche first half-profit rises 16 percent.</title>

<p>Swiss pharmaceuticals group Roche Holding AG said Tuesday its first-half net profit rose a healthy 16 percent and forecast higher profits for the full year, but analysts and markets were slightly disappointed with its operating performance.</p>
<p>Roche attributed the rise in first half profit to 2.2 billion francs ($1.85 billion) from 1.9 billion ($1.6 billion) to better operating results and the performance of its financial operations.</p>
<p>Analysts on average had forecast that Roche would show a 17 percent increase in net profit for the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;The results look fine but I would have liked a little more,&quot; said Peter McDougall of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Roche's first-half operating profits rose 8.0 percent to 1.9 billion francs ($1.6 billion), despite growing pressure on prices in major markets. However, analysts had looked for Roche's operating profit to rise 10 percent or more.</p>
<p>&quot;The operating result could have been better,&quot; said Christian Prinz of Credit Suisse's CS Research.</p>
<p>The company had already reported first-half sales of 7.77 billion francs ($6.52 billion) in July, an increase of 8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Barring extraordinary events, we can again expect to see a good overall result for the 1996 business year and in particular another increase in consolidated net profit,&quot; Roche said in its interim report.</p>
<p>It had a profit of 3.37 billion francs  ($2.83 billion) in 1995.</p>
