<p>Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi on Wednesday called for changes to the timing of the Davis Cup to stop the prestigious team event losing value on the crowded tennis calendar.</p>
<p>World number one Sampras said the annual event, which has been contested for most of the century, was being &quot;degraded&quot; because many top players skipped ties because they did not fit into their playing schedules -- including himself.</p>
<p>&quot;I have always thought it should be more like the Ryder Cup (in golf) which is played every two years,&quot; Sampras said at the Stuttgart Open. &quot;There is too much tennis... The Davis Cup can get lost in the shuffle.&quot;</p>
<p>Agassi said the competition should be held every two years at the most.</p>
<p>&quot;I have always said this. It is too difficult. You need a week to prepare and a week to come down afterwards,&quot; he said. &quot;I have played a lot of years and it is difficult to find the energy and time.&quot;</p>
<p>Neither Sampras nor Agassi played a role in United States' ties this year. As reigning champions, the Americans failed to make it to the semifinals after crashing out to the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Sampras, the three-times Wimbledon champion, said it was not certain that he would play in next year's event.</p>
<p>&quot;I will just have to look at next year...if I can fit it into my schedule then I'll play. If I can't, I won't,&quot; Sampras said after his 6-3 6-4 second round victory over Armenian Sargis Sargsian.</p>
<p>Two separate organisations currently share the running of world tennis.</p>
<p>Most of the tournaments are organised by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) while the Davis Cup and the grand slams -- Wimbledon and the French, U.S. and Australian Opens -- are run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).</p>
<p>In the last five seasons the ITF has also added the lucrative Grand Slam Cup to the programme which takes the tennis season into December.</p>
<p>&quot;The politics of the ITF and ATP are difficult,&quot; Sampras said. &quot;The year doesn't end. It just continues.&quot;</p>
<p>The knock-out Davis Cup competition is played over three days with four singles matches and a doubles rubber.</p>
<p>The event dates back to 1902 when the United States took on the British Isles.</p>
<p>In recent years players have complained more and more that the ties in February, April, September and November/December are hard to fit into their jet-set lives.</p>
