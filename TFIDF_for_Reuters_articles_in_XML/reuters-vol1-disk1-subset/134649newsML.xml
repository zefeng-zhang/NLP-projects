<headline>Reuters to reorganise UK, Ireland divisions.</headline>
<text>
<p>LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuter)  Reuters Holdings Plc said on Tuesday it would reorganise into three, the four business divisions that make up its UK and Ireland (UKI) operation.</p>
<p>The international news and information organisation said in a statement that UKI, which had 1995 revenue of 435 million stg, would create National, International, and European divisions to replace its existing City North, South, East and West divisions.</p>
<p>UKI managing director Julie Holland said the move came after a dynamic period of change in the City of London, adding, &quot;Each business division will be large enough to be a centre of expertise in either particular market sectors or client types.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We will be in a stronger position to improve technical support and manage business expansion more cost effectively against the background of tough competition, price pressures and new technologies,&quot; Holland was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The changes will take place progressively from January 1, 1997, and will see Geoff Wicks, formerly of City East, managing the National division, Claude Green, director City West, running the International division and David Gandy, City North, becoming director of the European division.</p>
<p>City South director Marion King has been appointed managing director of Reuters East Asia, based in Hong Kong, from 1997.</p>
<p>Reuters gave no details of any cost or financial implications of the restructuring moves.</p>
<p>It said the National division will be responsible for all UK and Irish banks and institutions, all money brokers and UKI's four regional offices.</p>
<p>International will manage all Asian, mainly Japanese, and U.S. clients, plus customers in the shipping business, while European will be responsible for clients in the commodities markets, plus all European clients in London, including the UK institutions taken over by European banks.</p>
