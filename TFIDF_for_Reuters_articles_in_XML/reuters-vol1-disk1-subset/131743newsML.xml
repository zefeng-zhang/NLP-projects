<title>UK: London gold perks up, boost other precious metals.</title>
<headline>London gold perks up, boost other precious metals.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold prices picked up modestly on Monday afternoon, lifting the rest of the precious metals complex, after a bearish mood dominated early European trading.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a bit of a surprise after the weak close on Friday. But gold's been very steady above $380 an ounce,&quot; a dealer said, referring to bullion's important support level. Bullion fixed at $381.00 an ounce, compared to a fixing of $380.00 in the morning and Friday's London close of $379.90/$380.40.</p>
<p>Prices started ticking up on the opening of New York's Comex futures market after a quiet overnight and morning.</p>
<p>Comex December gold was indicated up $1.40 at $383.50 an ounce, which some traders attributed to buying by investment funds after the Dow Industrials were weighed down in early New York trade.</p>
<p>A bearish sentiment has been overhanging the market due to disappointment in recent weeks by the failure of both gold and silver to stage sustained rallies.</p>
<p>Investors and speculators have mostly stayed away from the gold market, and expected to remain scarce, while U.S. stock and bond markets are strong. Gold was likely to encounter stiff resistance at between $381 and $382 an ounce, said technical analysts. Previously price charts had put resistance higher at $383.50.</p>
<p>&quot;This could be an afternoon where things look at bit perkier after New York opens, prices edge higher and then if you can't build momentum they turn back,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Silver was also a bit stronger on the back of gold's rise, indicated up two cents from Friday's London close at $4.93/$4.95 an ounce.</p>
<p>The psychological $5.00 an ounce level, which silver surmounted and then gave up over the past two weeks, would put up a tough fight on attempts to the upside, analysts said.</p>
<p>Platinum, like silver, took heart from stronger gold prices and rose more than $1.00 from morning levels.</p>
<p>It was indicated $0.20 firmer compared to Friday's close at $383.70/$384.70 an ounce.</p>
<p>Palladium, which sank to 3-1/2 year lows last week on slack industrial demand and oversupply, was up $0.75 from Friday's London close at $116.25/$117.25.</p>
