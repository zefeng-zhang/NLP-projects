<p>More than a century after Arbroath beat Bon Accord 36-0 for the biggest victory in first class soccer history, the clubs are preparing for a re-match.</p>
<p>They will meet again on Sunday to mark the opening of a new sports club in Bon Accord's home city of Aberdeen. The players and officials will be in period kit and fans will be asked to play their part by dressing up.</p>
<p>Arbroath, who play in the Scottish third division and Bon Accord who perform in junior soccer, met in their historic encounter on September 12, 1885 in a Scottish Cup match.</p>
<p>Bon Accord, who at the time were formed mainly of cricketers rather than soccer players, turned up at Arbroath with only nine men and had to recruit two more from the crowd.</p>
<p>Things started badly and then got worse for Bon Accord who trailed 15-0 at half-time. They were 20-0 down within 15 minutes of the re-start and conceded another 16 before the referee mercifully brought an end to their suffering.</p>
