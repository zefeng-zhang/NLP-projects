<p>Leading stories in the Greek general press:</p>
<p>KATHIMERINI</p>
<p>--The government moves to pension off workers at state-run banks at age 56. Unionists agree with the measure after a study on the merger of bank pension funds shows it will allow both a reduction of retirement age as well as pension contributions.</p>
<p>--Fighting in main opposition New Democracy continues unabated ahead of the party's Central Committee meeting tomorrow. Dissenters step up calls for internal party elections ahead of the party's congress but embattled ND leader Miltiades Evert resists.</p>
<p>TA NEA</p>
<p>--The likelihood of Ankara proceeding to another 'hot' incident in the Aegean - including the possibility of occupying one of the islets - is high, Defence Minister Akis Tsohadzopoulos says. Ankara's ambitions to force Greece to negotiations on its territorial integrity will be responded to &quot;immediately and with all means&quot;.</p>
<p>--Gangland came to a suburban Athens hospital yesterday as police shoot down a wanted man on his way to visit his girlfriend. </p>
<p>ELEFTHEROTYPIA</p>
<p>-- The refusal to index the taxation scales doubles the burden for taxpayers. Small and medium size enterprises pay three times the tax with the introduction of objective tax criteria. The planned abolition of tax exemptions will double taxes this year.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROS TYPOS</p>
<p>--ND leader Evert is expected to make overtures to the wider centre-right situated outside of ND, including the Political Spring party and its leader Antonis Samaras, a disaffected former ND minister, at the Central Committee meeting tomorrow.</p>
