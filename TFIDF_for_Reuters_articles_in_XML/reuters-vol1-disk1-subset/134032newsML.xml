<title>UNITED NATIONS: U.N. oil deal monitors put off trip to Iraq.</title>
<headline>U.N. oil deal monitors put off trip to Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>An advance team of three inspectors from a Dutch firm has postponed a visit to Iraq because of the unstable situation in the country's northern regions, diplomats said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The inspectors were pulled out of Iraq in September when fighting flared in the northern Kurdish provinces and the United Nations delayed implementing an oil-for-food plan.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the oil monitors had been scheduled to go back this week to perform preliminary inspections ahead of a possible implementation of the plan.</p>
<p>But their visit was further delayed further because of the situation in the north, where the United States is currently trying to implement a ceasefire between two Kurdish factions, the diplomats said.</p>
<p>The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell $2 billion of oil over six months, on a renewable basis, to buy food, medicine and other necessities to help offset the effect on ordinary Iraqis of sanctions imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>In other developments, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations was still trying to &quot;overcome all the difficulties because I believe it is a must to implement 986,&quot; a reference to the Security Council resolution that sets out the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that there is a war going on has complicated our situation on the ground,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said he was currently meeting with Gualtiero Fulcheri, the senior U.N. representative in Baghdad, who arrived in New York two days ago.</p>
