<p>Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said on Wednesday Kurdish separatist rebels in northern Iraq had massed on Turkey's borders and that Ankara would have to take measures to secure its frontiers.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman later said there was no question of sending the Turkish military into northern Iraq to attack the Kurdish guerrillas at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;We have noted that to a large degree the terrorists have massed on our borders and there could be infiltrations of our borders,&quot; Ciller told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;In such a dangerous situation, Turkey is of course going to ensure border security and stop crossings,&quot; she said. &quot;Turkey is going to evaluate what measures it will take with neighbouring countries and do what is necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Ciller was speaking in a news conference about the situation in northern Iraq, where Iraqi troops helped an Iraqi Kurdish faction oust a rival group from the city of Arbil on Saturday, prompting U.S. missile attacks on Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Up to 35,000 Turkish troops poured into northern Iraq in March 1995 in their biggest cross-border incursion in pursuit of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been fighting for 12 years for control of southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>Ankara says instability in northern Iraq enables the PKK to set up bases there and attack Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;As of today, no military operation has begun,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel later told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it is best to interpret (Ciller's) remarks today as a warning to certain people and circles,&quot; he said, referring to the PKK.</p>
<p>Akbel said Turkey was ready to take all kinds of precautions in response to the events in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;It goes without saying that our precautions, as always, will be respectful of Iraq's sovereignty, and its political and territorial integrity,&quot; he said.</p>
