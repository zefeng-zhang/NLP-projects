<p>U.S. planes began enforcing an expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq on Wednesday and quickly encountered Iraqi challenges, firing at anti-aircraft radar and facing off two MIGs, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>There was also anti-aircraft firing in Baghdad, but U.S. officials said their planes were not involved. &quot;It's not precipitated by anything that U.S. forces are involved in,&quot; an official said.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said cruise missiles had successfully concluded a mission to destroy anti-aircraft capabilities in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>He said allied planes had also stifled two Iraqi efforts to intimidate their expanded patrols.</p>
<p>&quot;We encountered two challenges on this first day of patrolling again,&quot; Perry told reporters. &quot;In one of them, two MIGs approached our planes from the north but both of them turned back before they got to 33 degrees north&quot; -- the border of the expanded no-fly zone.</p>
<p>In the second incident, an F-16 jet fired a Harm missile at an anti-aircraft radar that had &quot;illuminated&quot; the plane from just north of the new zone.</p>
<p>Perry and other officials said the radar went silent but they could not say whether it had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Perry said the Iraqi radar was located outside the northern edge of the exclusion zone but that the allies had the right to attack it in self-defence once it &quot;painted&quot; the U.S. jet.</p>
<p>The allies began patrolling over southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War and they extended the zone on Wednesday by one degree of latitude up to Baghdad's southern suburbs.</p>
<p>The extension was part of U.S. retaliation for President Saddam Hussein's decision to send troops into a Kurdish area of northern Iraq also protected by the allies.</p>
<p>That sparked two rounds of U.S. cruise missile attacks against Iraqi anti-aircraft defences in the south on Tuesday and early on Wednesday, an effort that Perry said had now been successfully completed.</p>
<p>&quot;We have successfully completed the mission to attack the air defence facilities -- a total of 14 air defence facilities -- south of the 33rd parallel,&quot; he said at a joint news conference with visiting British Defence Minister Michael Portillo.</p>
<p>Portillo's visit, although long scheduled, served to underscore British solidarity with the United States in the latest showdown with Saddam.</p>
<p>Some other U.S. allies, including France, have withheld support for the missile strikes and widenened no-fly zone, but Perry denied the Western coalition forged in the Gulf War had weakened.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident the coalition is not weakening. If anything I think the coalition is strengthening and I fully expect the French to continue participation,&quot; Perry said.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials said earlier on Wednesday that French Mirage jets took part in the first day of patrols of the expanded no-fly exclusion zone in Iraq. But French government officials said later in Paris that the Mirages stayed below the 32nd parallel.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said many in Congress were concerned at the apparent lack of allied support in the current crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The contrast between Desert Storm (the Gulf War coalition effort) and the current level of (allied) support is a concern,&quot; the Georgia Republican told reporters. He said Congress would fully support U.S. troops in the Middle East. The Senate is drafting a resolution of support.</p>
<p>Air Force General Joseph Ralston, deputy chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a briefing on the cruise missile attacks that 27 missiles were fired at about 15 targets including missile sites, radars and communications sites in the Iraq zone early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Seventeen more were fired at four of the targets in the second wave on Wednesday Iraq time because cloud cover left doubts whether these targets were destroyed in the first strike.</p>
