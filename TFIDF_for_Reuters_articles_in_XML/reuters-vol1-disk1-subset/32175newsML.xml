<title>USA: CME live cattle end unchanged in nearby contracts.</title>
<headline>CME live cattle end unchanged in nearby contracts.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME October and December live cattle futures closed unchanged and deferred months finished narrowly mixed after light late trading.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle ended higher on session-long support from lower CBOT corn futures, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the inability of December live cattle to hold its new contract high of 68.225 cents per lb, fueled light selling late that erased gains in both October and December.</p>
<p>Some traders said October may be near its peak. It has priced in $70.00-per-cwt cash trades. Feedlot managers and analysts believe $70.00 may be the near-term cash top, because it should produce an abundance of selling.</p>
<p>Cattle sold at $70 per cwt in Nebraska direct trade and at $110 per cwt on a carcass basis, private sources there said. Both prices were $1.00 higher than last week's trade.</p>
<p>However, no such sales were reported by late morning in Kansas, Oklahoma or Texas Panhandle direct trade.</p>
<p>Some sources said meat packers may be resisting $70 prices because of poor operating margins. Even at higher beef prices quoted so far this week, traders and analysts said meat packers were losing money on beef sales.  </p>
<p>USDA reported boxed beef values near midday Wednesday were up $0.92 to $0.59 per cwt from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures ended higher, drawing support from lower CBOT corn futures and from early gains in live cattle.</p>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed down eight cents in December at $3.33-1/2 per bushel in reaction to Farmers Commodities Corp forecast for a 9.02 billion bushel corn crop, which exceeded USDA's latest estimate of 8.695 billion.</p>
<p>Live cattle futures closed down 0.050 to up 0.100 cent with October unchanged at 71.725 cents per lb and December unchanged at 67.750. Feeder cattle closed up 0.825 to 0.350 cent with October up the most at 64.050 cents.</p>
