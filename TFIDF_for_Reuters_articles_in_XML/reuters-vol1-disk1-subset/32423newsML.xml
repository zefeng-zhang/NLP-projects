<title>FRANCE: French stocks close up in technical rebound.</title>
<headline>French stocks close up in technical rebound.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>French stocks finished higher in a technical rebound on Wednesday helped by strong results at blue-chip energy group Total, brokers said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 13.34 points, or 0.68 percent, at 1,984.77, while the CAC-40 September futures contract finished 15 points higher at 1,992.</p>
<p>Wednesday's rise was the second in the past eight sessions and traders said the bourse appears to be under pressure. They said investors are likely to be cautious ahead of the U.S. August jobs figures due out on Friday.  </p>
<p>Volume totalled 3.84 billion francs.</p>
<p>Traders said the market shrugged off a second set of missile attacks by the United States on Iraq and was encouraged by reports of planned tax cuts in the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>* Energy group Total shares rose 0.13 percent to 385 francs, extending its recent gains, after reporting a 45 percent jump in its first-half net attributable profit, reflecting higher production and higher oil prices.</p>
<p>* Rival Elf-Aquitaine, due to report first-half results on Thursday morning, also closed up 0.18 percent at 382.50.  </p>
<p>* Retailer Carrefour, which also reports first-half results on Thursday, rose 4.33 percent to 2,697 francs. Analysts expect good results and were encouraged by the group's 8.7 percent rise in August sales.</p>
<p>* Cerus, the French holding company of Italian industrialist Carlo De Benedetti, rose on speculation that his resignation from Olivetti increases the prospects of a sale by Cerus of its 28 percent stake in car parts firm Valeo.</p>
<p>Valeo rose 0.82 percent to 258 francs as the sale of Cerus's stake may attract a takeover bid.</p>
<p>Cerus said its position on a Valeo stake sale was unchanged.  </p>
<p>Valeo's first-half results are due on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>* Credit Local de France rose 2.91 percent to 425 francs after reporting a six percent rise in net attributable profit for the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>* Danone reported after the close that its first-half profit rose to 1.73 billion francs from 1.70 billion. Its stock had finished up 1.02 percent at 692 francs.</p>
<p>* Other companies due to report first-half results on Thursday include Cap Gemini, Arjo Wiggins and Credit du Nord.</p>
