<p>A Northern Ireland Catholic housewife made a desperate plea on Wednesday to guerrillas styling themselves as anti-drug vigilantes to lift a death threat on her son.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't take much more of it. We have a right to live in peace, so leave us alone,&quot; said Jean Kennedy at a hastily arranged news conference in her Belfast home.</p>
<p>With her face hidden from cameras she added: &quot;I want to get it across to people. My son is no drug dealer and never was a drug dealer. He hasn't a penny.&quot;</p>
<p>Kennedy and her family are victims of vicious campaigns that have gripped Protestant and Catholic strongholds for two years leaving many maimed and at least ten dead.</p>
<p>When rival guerrilla groups called ceasefires in 1994, their hard men swapped guns for clubs in a bid to tighten their grip on their communities by taking a self-appointed &quot;policing role&quot;.</p>
<p>Security sources say masked gangs use clubs, iron bars, hammers and concrete blocks to smash limbs and inflict incapacitating injuries in the sprawling housing estates where they command much of their support.</p>
<p>Catholic IRA extremists and Protestant Loyalist foes refuse to admit they are behind a wave of so-called &quot;punishment attacks&quot;. But their victims and the police are in no doubt.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have been targetted. The attackers label their victims &quot;anti-social elements&quot; and accuse them of stealing, burglary or drug dealing.</p>
<p>In hardline Catholic communities which reject the predominantly Protestant police force some residents give tacit support to the guerrillas' &quot;rough justice&quot;.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night a 21-year-old man had both legs broken by men who bundled him into a car in north Belfast. The previous day men beat a teenager with nail-studded clubs.</p>
<p>Since September 1994, Irish republican militiamen have carried out 308 attacks and their pro-British Protestant foes have struck 197 times, according to police.</p>
<p>Even before the IRA ended their 17-month ceasefire last February, they had been blamed for a string of killings carried out by the so-called &quot;Direct Action Against Drugs&quot; (DAAD) group.</p>
<p>Police say DAAD is a cover for the IRA, which has fought a 25-year war aimed at ending London's rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Kennedy said her home was daubed with graffiti that pilloried her 21-year-old son as a drug dealer. &quot;Once your name goes up on the walls, that's it.&quot;</p>
<p>Blaming DAAD, she said they were using a drug smear as a cover for &quot;a personal vendetta&quot; against her son.</p>
<p>Men burst into her home last May and beat her husband with an iron bar. They were looking for her son but he had barricaded himself his bedroom. &quot;I presume it was the IRA,&quot; she said.</p>
