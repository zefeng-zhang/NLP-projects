<p>Food wholesaler Booker on Wednesday made an 264 million pound ($413.7 million) agreed bid for rival Nurdin &amp; Peacock and said the merger would bring warehouse closures and job cuts.</p>
<p>The deal steps up the pace of rationalisation in Britain's fiercely competitive food retailing sector, where wholesalers have found it tough to compete against powerful supermarket groups and discount stores.</p>
<p>Booker chief executive Charles Bowen said about 40 warehouses would close if the merger went ahead and head offices would be rationalised, but he could not be specific about how many jobs would go.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be around 40 depot closures, but we can't talk about the number of jobs,&quot; he said by telephone.</p>
<p>Bowen said the combined business would have a market share of about 22 percent and their buying power would equal many of the supermarkets.</p>
<p>Wholesalers such as Booker and Nurdin have come under increasing pressure as superstore chains such as Tesco and ASDA and discount stores have muscled in on the business of cash-and-carry outlets, which traditionally supply caterers and small shops.</p>
<p>Bowen said the deal would underpin the catering side of the business, but the market for independent retailers would inevitably decline because of competition from supermarkets.</p>
<p>Nurdin chairman Richard Fulford said, &quot;It has been clear for some time that the food wholesaling industry must undergo a process of rationalisation and consolidation to respond to the growing pressures from food retailing multiples.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year Nurdin rejected a bid by private Dutch group SHV Makro, which owns a 14 percent stake in Nurdin.</p>
<p>SHV proposed a merger of its Makro UK business with Nurdin in exchange for a controlling stake in N&amp;P. This followed Nurdin's sale of its abortive U.S.-style warehouse club business Cargo Club to J. Sainsbury for 45 million pounds.</p>
<p>Bowen said SHV had been informed of the agreed bid, but had not made a response.</p>
<p>Booker, which also has food manufacturing and distribution businesses, expects to make annual cost savings of about 10 million pounds in the first financial year after the merger and it sees these more than doubling in the following two years.</p>
<p>To achieve the savings Booker estimates it will need to make a one-off provision for restructuring of about 52 million pounds. It expects the deal to enhance earnings in the first full financial year.</p>
<p>Under the offer, Nurdin shareholders will receive 14 new Booker shares and 154.53 pounds in cash for every 100 Nurdin shares. Based on a Booker share price of 360.5 pence a share the offer values Nurdin shares at 205 pence.</p>
<p>Booker said Nurdin shareholders may choose a full cash alternative of 201 pence a share or take additional shares in place of all or part of the cash offer.</p>
