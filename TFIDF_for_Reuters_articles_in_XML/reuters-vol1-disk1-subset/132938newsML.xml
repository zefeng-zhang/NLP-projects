<p>Mediterranean oil products were mixed on Tuesday, with gas oil lower and gasoline higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Gas oil retreated in line with IPE futures but business was quiet with most traders saying October requirements were well covered. They said good supplies of heating oil including Russian product were putting pressure on premiums.</p>
<p>They noted an apparently distressed cargo of 25,000 tonnes of heating oil looking for a home in the Mediterranean after its owner apparently abandoned an attempt to seek customers in the north.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices edged higher with the rise in NYMEX futures prices and traders said high octane supplies were still tight in the region due to refinery turnarounds.</p>
<p>One trader said Italian demand should also buoy high octane prices while buying for low octane appeared to be drying up in the Med. &quot;The market looks reasonably balanced for high octane,&quot; he said.Premium unleaded cargoes rose about $2 from Monday.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices were steady to slightly lower tracking the volatile gasoline market and traders said physical market activity was quiet ahead of November programmes. &quot;The market is on standby waiting for the November program,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil was a touch softer. One trader offered to sell at what many saw as below market. An ISAB 25,000 tonne cargo was heard offered around $115 fob Med by one trader, while another bought an ISAB 50kt cargo at high fob Med +50 cents loading Oct 29-31. &quot;There are signs of weakness in the Med, but I think we will see some forced pressure to push prices down,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked was quiet with offers heard at $137.50 cif Milazzo, but the main Med buyer was quiet owing to port congestion. The Mersin refinery's shutdown could tighten the straight run market since up to three cargoes are exported every month.</p>
