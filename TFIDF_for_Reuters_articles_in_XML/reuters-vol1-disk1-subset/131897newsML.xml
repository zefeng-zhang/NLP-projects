<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS - News declines comment on bid report.</title>
<headline>RTRS - News declines comment on bid report.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The News Corp Ltd said on Monday it had no comment on a British newspaper report that satellite broadcaster BSkyB was planning a bid worth more than four billion stg for media group Pearson Plc.</p>
<p>News owns 40 percent of BSkyB.  </p>
<p>A News Corp spokeswoman in Sydney told Reuters the report was a matter for BSkyB, which was only partly owned by News.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, The Independent newspaper said in a front-page report said the bid preparations were at an early stage and it added that they were believed to have been mounted in cooperation with a U.S.-based media company.</p>
<p>A BSkyB spokesman declined comment on the report.</p>
<p>Pearson owns the Financial Times newspaper, Penguin Books and a number of television production companies.</p>
<p>Its current market capitalisation is just under four billion stg.  </p>
<p>It hit the headlines last week when it appointed American Marjorie Scardino as its chief executive to succeed Frank Barlow from January 1.</p>
<p>She becomes the first woman head of a top 100 British company.</p>
<p>BSkyB has developed into one of British leading companies in the 1990s and now has a market capitalisation of almost 12 billion stg.</p>
<p>The report said that Pearson was discounting a full bid from BSkyB, believing instead that its real target was the company's television interests.  </p>
<p>But the report added that BSkyB was understood to be interested in retaining the Financial Times and buying the 50 percent of the Economist which Pearson does not own.</p>
<p>It said remaining assets such as theme parks and Penguin books would be sold off.</p>
<p>BSkyB's advisers Goldman Sachs are believed to have already started to purchase Pearson shares as a prelude to a bid, the report said. It said BSkyB might eventually have to pay up to six billion stg to capture Pearson.</p>
