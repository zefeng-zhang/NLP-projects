<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Monday that Japan's election results showed his party had not fully regained public confidence, but he pledged to stay at the helm in a new coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to continue to be in charge of the government as the leader of the party which has the largest number of seats in parliament,&quot; Hashimoto told a news conference.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) captured 239 seats in the 500-seat Lower House of parliament, just short of a simple majority that would have put the LDP back in one-party government after three years of coalition rule.</p>
<p>Hashimoto was due to meet the leaders of the other parties in the outgoing three-way coalition, Sakigake's Shoichi Ide and Takako Doi of the Social Democrats, later on Monday to try to form a new working majority.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said he was not ruling out links with any other politicians who could join forces with his LDP.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing is to stress what is common between us and other politicians, either as individuals or in a group, to work together,&quot; Hashimoto said in a reply to a question about whether he would make an overture to the fledgling Democratic Party, which won 52 seats in the new Lower House.</p>
<p>In order to hold comfortable majorities in both houses of parliament, Hashimoto needs the Lower House seats held by the Democrats and the Upper House seats of the Social Democrats.</p>
<p>LDP officials have said they may also court independents and possible defectors from the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).</p>
<p>Hashimoto said he favoured a continued coalition with the Social Democrats and Sakigake, even though both parties saw a sharp fall in support. The Social Democrats now hold 15 seats in the Lower House against 30 previously, while Sakigake has just two, compared with nine.</p>
<p>Asked how he regarded the overall results in Sunday's general elections, Hashimoto said: &quot;The result means that we have not regained the full confidence of the people. It means that we have not been given a full score in our three-year effort to reform ourselves and that we must try even harder.&quot;</p>
<p>After a series of funding scandals, the LDP was toppled from power in 1993 after almost 38 years of single party government.</p>
