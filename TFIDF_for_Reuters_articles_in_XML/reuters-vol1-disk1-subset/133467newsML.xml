<p>Co-Premier Hun Sen vowed on Tuesday to open up the rebel base of Pailin to the rest of Cambodia, repairing roads into the northwest town and issuing diplomatic passports to dissident Khmer Rouge leaders.</p>
<p>During his tour of the Khmer Rouge heartland, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen also assured villagers and dissident guerrillas they could keep their land and weapons when Pailin came under government control.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can take your land, we will not seize it from you,&quot; the premier told a crowd of 3,000 civilians and fighters in this war-ravaged town near Cambodia's northwest border with Thailand.</p>
<p>At noon, Hun Sen held unprecedented talks with dissident Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary, who broke with hardliners loyal to Pol Pot in August and has been discussing a merger of his force of up to 4,000 guerrillas with the government.</p>
<p>Pailin was long the official headquarters of the Maoist guerrillas, who reneged on a 1991 U.N.-brokered peace pact and fought the coalition formed in the 1993 polls.</p>
<p>Hun Sen later pledged numerous concessions to the rebels, including repairing their roads, renovating the temple in Pailin and building schools in Pailin and the stronghold of Phnom Malai.</p>
<p>The premier said he would soon issue a diplomatic passport for Ieng Sary and his wife, adding that passports had been issued to the top two dissident commanders Ei Chien and Sok Peap.</p>
<p>He said Ieng Sary indicated several of his units would merge with government forces soon, but added that full integration would not happen until roads into the town were repaired.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't worry so much about the forces merging because the roads are more important,&quot; Hun Sen said, referring to the roads between Pailin and Battambang, Phnom Malai and Samlaut.</p>
<p>Samlaut is a former hardline base taken by Ieng Sary's forces last month.</p>
<p>Ei Chien, commander of the Pailin-based Division 415, had earlier told Hun Sen and government soldiers, &quot;We will do our best to consolidate the two-month ceasefire so that it will change very quickly into a true permanent peace with no loser and no winner.&quot;</p>
<p>Hun Sen was the prime advocate of granting an amnesty to his bitter foe Ieng Sary from a 1979 death sentence handed down in absentia for his role in the genocide of more than one million people as foreign minister in the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime.</p>
<p>&quot;After I build a school in Pailin, I would not give an order to...shell or destroy this building,&quot; pledged the premier, who handed out food to the crowd and gave children pens and notebooks sporting a picture of himself and his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Hun Sen's presence in the city of Pailin today clearly shows that our independent Cambodia is only one and cannot be divided by anybody,&quot; Ei Chien told the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;It also clearly shows that nobody can move our people living in the Pailin region to any other camp and that nobody can seize our people's territory, which is their own property.&quot;</p>
<p>The government, particularly Hun Sen, had shown impatience at the slow pace of reconciliation and was irritated at the dissidents' demands for top command posts in the military and police and for control of Pailin as a separate province.</p>
<p>But Hun Sen was far more conciliatory after his meeting with Ieng Sary, whom he referred to as &quot;uncle&quot;.</p>
