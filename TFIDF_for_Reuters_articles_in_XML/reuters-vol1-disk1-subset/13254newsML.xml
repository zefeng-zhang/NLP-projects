<title>SYRIA: Palestinian leader in Syria over Jerusalem, peace.</title>

<p>Palestinian leader Faisal al-Husseini will arrive Damascus on Sunday to discuss with Syrian and Palestinian officials recent developments in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>A Palestinian official said Husseini, a PLO excutive committee member and responsible for Jerusalem affairs, would discuss with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara what the official termed Israel's &quot;destruction and Judaisation measures of Jerusalem as a severe blow to the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Anwar Abdul-Hadi, information consultant for PLO foreign affairs chief Farouk Kaddoumi, accused Israel of putting obstacles before the peace, saying that could destroy the whole process.</p>
<p>He said Husseini's talks would cover the policy of Israel's ruling Likud party which he warned would lead to the &quot;collapse of the whole peace process if (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu does not adhere to the land-for-peace principle, especially on the Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>After winning elections in May, the Likud leader voiced opposition to handing back land seized from the Arabs in 1967, including Jerusalem, and vowed the city would be Israel's eternal capital.</p>
<p>Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.</p>
<p>Israel earlier this month lifted a ban, imposed by the previous Labour government, on building settlements in the West Bank. The housing ministry later announced a plan to build 5,000 houses there.</p>
<p>&quot;Husseini will also exchange views with Khaled al-Fahoum, head of the Palestinian National Salvation Front, over the Palestinian situation following the election of Netanyahu's government which opposes the minimum conditions for peace,&quot; Abdul-Hadi said.</p>
<p>Husseini would also discuss with Shara how to coordinate positions in preparation for the Jerusalem Committee meeting to be held in Morocco next month.</p>
