<p>British brewer Bass Plc said on Monday it would probably exercise an option in Prazske Pivovary a.s. at the start of November to give it a majority stake in the Prague-based brewer.</p>
<p>&quot;We have 46 percent in Prazske Pivovary (PP) now and we also have a five percent option exercisable at the beginning of November...I think we'll exercise that option,&quot; Mervyn Childs, Bass country manager for the Czech Republic, told Reuters.</p>
<p>PP is one of the top four brewing groups in the Czech Republic, producing some of the country's most popular brands such as Staropramen, Mestan and Branik.</p>
<p>In 1993, Bass took a 34 percent share in PP for nine million pounds and has been gradually increasing it since.</p>
<p>Childs said that Bass had always foreseen a consolidation in the Czech brewing industry with many smaller brewers being swallowed up and three major groups emerging.</p>
<p>In July, Bass took a 20 percent stake in another of the country's top brewing groups, north Moravia-based Radegast a.s..</p>
<p>Childs said Bass was talking to other major shareholders in Radegast -- IPB a.s. which has 34 percent and KIS a.s. which has around 30 percent -- about increasing its stake.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made no secret of saying we're talking to other shareholders in Radegast. We have 20 percent but would like to increase that shareholding,&quot; Childs told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to think there has been some movement (on this) by the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Childs said that if plans to take a bigger share in Radegast failed, Bass would look elsewhere in the Czech brewing industry to strengthen its position.</p>
<p>He added that his company was sensitive to national pride about beer in the Czech Republic -- the world's biggest per capita consumer of the drink -- and would be discreet in running its operations.</p>
<p>Asked whether Bass would prefer to achieve its objectives within Radegast without taking a high visibility majority stake, Childs replied: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>The British brewer also has large stakes in two small regional Czech breweries.</p>
