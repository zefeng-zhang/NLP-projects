<title>CROATIA: UN denies reported plan for E.Slavonia Serb exodus.</title>
<headline>UN denies reported plan for E.Slavonia Serb exodus.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United Nations on Tuesday denied a French press report that it had a secret plan to cope with a feared mass exodus of Serbs when Eastern Slavonia, Croatia's last Serb-held enclave, reverts to Croatian rule.</p>
<p>Croatian authorities are due to take over in Eastern Slavonia by next April 15 at the latest, and the French daily Le Monde said on Tuesday that U.N. officials on the scene feared this would provoke a flight of the region's 130,000 Serbs.</p>
<p>But Philip Arnold, spokesman for the U.N. transitional administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES), denied the existence of any secret evacuation plan.</p>
<p>&quot;UNTAES has no plans for organising refugee camps or an outflow of refugees,&quot; he told Reuters in Croatia.</p>
<p>&quot;On the basis of the experience of the last few months, we are not planning for a refugee exodus,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Arnold said that, while UNTAES could not rule out the possibility of some Serbs leaving, the U.N. mission was going well and an orderly handover with Croatia was anticipated next year.</p>
<p>Alemka Lisinski, spokeswoman in Croatia for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said the UNHCR also had no &quot;secret or special plan&quot; for a refugee exodus, although it was always prepared for contingencies throughout former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Le Monde said the U.N., wary of a repeat of the panic exodus of Serbs from parts of Sarajevo when it reverted to Bosnian federation rule early this year, hoped to prepare an orderly departure from Eastern Slavonia.</p>
<p>It said UNTAES opposed a Serb exodus but saw itself as being unable to prevent it.</p>
<p>Le Monde said it had seen a secret U.N. document calling for the channelling of Serb refugees towards Danube River bridges leading to Serbia proper.</p>
<p>U.N. officials on the spot were trying to encourage Serbs to stay but they believed Serb and Croat authorities had reached a secret agreement favouring ethnic separation which would be politically beneficial to both sides as they sought to consolidate post-war borders, the paper said.</p>
<p>Le Monde said the U.N. had drawn up plans for huge refugee camps in case there was an exodus, presumably across the Danube River border to Serbia, part of rump Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The newspaper said many Serbs, especially those who lived in the area before nationalist war with Croats broke out in 1991, wished to remain even under Croatian government rule.</p>
<p>But they feared scenes of revenge when the area's 80,000 former Croat inhabitants, expelled by Serbs in 1991, returned.</p>
<p>A senior U.N. source in Croatia who asked not to be named dismissed the idea of a secret Serbian-Croatian pact.</p>
<p>&quot;The political analysis is wrong. Yugoslavia certainly has no interest in having 1,000 or 100,000 more Serb refugees. They are sinking under the numbers they have already,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The big question is whether Yugoslavia would allow East Slavonian Serbs into the country as refugees.&quot;</p>
<p>Croat refugees threatened earlier this month to force their way back into the region unless U.N. peace troops left by January and local elections were held by mid-December.</p>
<p>UNTAES, backed by 5,000 peace troops, moved into Eastern Slavonia last January with the task of gradually reinstating Croatian government rule there in one year, with the option of up to a year's extension if needed.</p>
<p>Croatia's nationalist government said recently it would reluctantly accept a three-month extension to April 15, 1997, recommended by the U.N. administrator of the region.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council will decide the issue next month.</p>
