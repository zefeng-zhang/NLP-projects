<p>Cocoa arrivals in Ivory Coast appear slow ahead of the 1996/97 marketing season, expected to open on Wednesday or Thursday, and the announcement of official farm-gate prices, exporters said.</p>
<p>They said arrivals had been slowed down by people holding back for a decision on price.</p>
<p>&quot;Average weekly arrivals are on average 5,000-6,000 tonnes, 7,000 maximum, for both Abidjan and San Pedro (combined),&quot; one Abidjan-based trader said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say arrivals since the beginning of October are at least 20,000 tonnes, but it is very difficult to say,&quot; said a second Abidjan exporter.</p>
<p>Estimated arrivals by this time in the 1995/96 season ranged from 22,000 to 47,000 tonnes, about the same as during the 1994/95 season.</p>
<p>October 1995 presidential elections and political and ethnic violence in part of the western cocoa growing zone slowed arrivals at the start of the 1995/96 season, which produced a record of around 1.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Exporters in Abidjan and San Pedro said quality of arrivals was very good and pod count estimates ranged from 95 to 100 beans per 100 grammes. &quot;Quality is excellent, and average pod count is between 95-98. There are no problems with humidity,&quot; said one San Pedro exporter.</p>
<p>On farm-gate prices, exporters said the government was rumoured to be pressing for an increase from 320 CFA francs per kilo to 340, but had run into World Bank resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;The World Bank want to push it down to 325 CFA francs,&quot; an Abidjan-based exporter said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard rumours that the World Bank and the government can't agree on a price,&quot; one exporter said, adding that this might explain the delayed start to the season.</p>
<p>The opening of the season has been delayed by about three weeks. The government has given no explanation.</p>
<p>Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze told reporters on Monday at a two-day ministerial review in Gabon of the 1993 International Cocoa Agreement that the season would open in two to three days.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is saying that the season will open in two days time,&quot; said one Abidjan exporter.</p>
<p>Officials said the government would be meeting under Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Formal announcements are usually made the following day after a full cabinet meeting under President Henri Konan Bedie.</p>
<p>The latest rumour was that an announcement would coincide with the start of a major ruling Democratic Party congress next Monday, one industry source said.</p>
<p>Exporters added that the government was keen to unveil a price before the start of the congress.</p>
<p>Some linked the delay to the start of the marketing campaign to the appointment last month of a new head of Ivory Coast's Caistab marketing board, Yves-Marie Koissy, who previously worked at the International Monetary Fund. &quot;I think the new director coming in has slowed things down,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Gauze said on Monday that 1996/97 production would be between 900,000 and 950,000 tonnes. &quot;This is a very important element as it coincides with World Bank and International Monetary Fund plans,&quot; he said.</p>
