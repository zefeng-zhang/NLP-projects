<p>Loewen Group Inc chief executive officer Raymond Loewen, whose funeral home chain is battling a $2.9 billion hostile takeover, said Tuesday he does not believe Loewen shareholders want to sell their shares.</p>
<p>Service Corp International, North America's largest operator of funeral homes and cemeteries, is offering to buy Loewen for $45 a share in stock.  </p>
<p>On October 10 the board of Vancouver-based Loewen Group said the offer was inadequate and urged shareholders to hold onto their stock.</p>
<p>Using a funeral directors convention in Cincinnati as his forum, Loewen said his company has a &quot;superior&quot; business plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Business plan is a euphemism for earnings growth which ultimately translates into share price which ultimately translates into profitability for the shareholder,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our business plan is so dramatic and superior that I don't think our shareholders want to sell,&quot; Loewen said at a question and answer session.</p>
<p>Asked if Service Corp might prevail, Loewen said, &quot;One thing I have been taught for a long time is never to to say never (but) you have two different personalities and two different cultures.&quot; He said combining the companies would not be in Loewen shareholders' best interests.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for Houston-based Service declined comment, saying the company is in a quiet period regarding its offer.</p>
<p>A takeover battle could last for months.</p>
<p>Loewen Group has filed a U.S. federal antitrust lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition although the National Funeral Directors Association said independent funeral home firms account for about 85 percent of the business.  </p>
<p>Both Loewen and Service have grown rapidly, often acquiring funeral homes from independent owners who do not have children interested in taking over the family business.</p>
<p>This year alone Loewen Group, the second largest funeral home operator, sealed about $1.3 billion in acquisitions. It has 926 U.S. and Canada funeral homes and 263 cemeteries.</p>
<p>Service Corp at September 30 had 2,864 funeral homes, 335 cemeteries and 147 crematoria.  </p>
<p>Ralph Watts, a Smith Barney adviser to Loewen, said Loewen and his wife own about 15 percent of stock, with another five percent held by management and management stock plans.</p>
<p>In addition, support may be strong among funeral directors who have sold their companies to Loewen and whose stock ownership boosts the total to 23 or 24 percent, Watts said.</p>
<p>At least one person in the Loewen fold backed up that view.  </p>
<p>&quot;We as employees would not want to merge,&quot; said Charles Stephens, who sold his Meridian, Miss., funeral home to Loewen two years ago. Stephens remains active in day-to-day operations and believes he made the right choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Loewen offers better benefits (for the seller than Service Corp) and their philosophy is closer to mine,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Several funeral directors said that with or without a merger of the two giants, industry consolidation is likely to continue. Offers from Loewen, Service Corp or other companies are welcome if there is no successor to take over the business when the owner is ready to retire, they said.</p>
<p>Paul Hummel, who owns two funeral homes in Akron, Ohio, said if Service Corp succeeds in acquiring Loewen, prices paid for funeral businesses may decline. The Big Two often bid against one another for the same properties.  </p>
<p>But Garry Hood of the Bilbrey Funeral Home in Crossville, Tenn., said the cost of buying a funeral business is now prohibitive, so lower pricetags could be beneficial for a small businessperson who wants to buy a funeral home.</p>
<p>Small funeral home operators said whether Service Corp succeeds or not, independents will continue to be the mainstay of the industry because they provide more personalized, sensitive service to grieving families at a time of need.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I'm not worried&quot; about corporate competition, said sixth-generation funeral director Richard Watson Jr. of Millsboro, Del. &quot;They can't provide the level of service the independent provides.&quot;</p>
