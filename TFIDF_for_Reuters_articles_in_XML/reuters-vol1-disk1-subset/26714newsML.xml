<headline>Portuguese suit vs Eurocopter to heard September.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-09-02</dateline>

<p>A suit launched by a Portuguese firm against Eurocopter, accusing it of not paying commission on an alleged sanctions-busting helicopter sale to South Africa, will be heard in a French court later this month, the law firm representing the plaintiffs said on Monday.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Beverley Securities Inc (BSI) said in a statement that the suit accusing Eurocopter of &quot;unjust enrichment&quot; would begin hearings at Bobigny commericial court in the Paris suburbs on September 12 (at 0800 GMT).</p>
<p>The proceedings would be conducted in open court, contrary to Eurocopter's desire for them to take place behind closed doors, London law firm Roodyn Porter Manski said in a statement.</p>
<p>Eurocopter is a joint venture between French state-owned aerospace group SNI Aerospatiale and Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG.</p>
<p>Eurocopter could not be reached for comment. Aerospatiale said it had no comment.</p>
<p>BSI is suing Eurocopter International for 10 to 15 percent of the total value of the helicopter deal, which it estimates to have been worth $3.0 billion. It says it facilitated the transaction through its contacts in the Portuguese defence force.</p>
<p>BSI has alleged that the kitsets were delivered between 1989 and 1994 and were assembled in South Africa as &quot;Oryx&quot; medium-lift helicopters.</p>
<p>The lawyers for BSI said that among the witnesses it planned to summon are Tony de Klerk, former director of Armscor for foreign procurement and clandestine operations based in Paris and General Soares Carneiro, former President of the Portuguese Supreme Military Court and, at the time, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>South Africa's state weapons agency Armscor has refused to comment on the allegations it obtained 50 Oryx helicopters from France via Portugal during the UN arms embargo.</p>
<p>It said last April that &quot;the terms of the contract reflects the international practice of confidentiality with respect to arms contracts.&quot;</p>
