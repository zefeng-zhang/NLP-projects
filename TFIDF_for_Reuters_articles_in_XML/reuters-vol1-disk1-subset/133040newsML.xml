<p>The United Nations on Tuesday evacuated 48 aid workers trapped in eastern Zaire by fighting between the army and ethnic Tutsis as 10,000 more Hutu refugees joined a mass exodus from camps, U.N. officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to all sides to step back from the brink of what now threatens to become a very real humanitarian disaster in a region that has already suffered enough,&quot; a spokesman in Geneva for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Ron Redmond, said.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of exhausted Hutu refugees and displaced Zaireans flooded towards the provincial capital of Bukavu, fleeing fighting between soldiers and Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels in the town of Uvira, 100 km (65 miles) to the south.</p>
<p>Near Bukavu itself, until now unaffected by the chaos around Uvira, nearly 10,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees fled Nyangezi camp for fear of being attacked by the Banyamulenge -- ethnic Tutsis who came to Zaire from Rwanda at the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Michelle Quintaglie, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Programme in Kenya, said there were indications that refugees from other camps were also taking to the road near Bukavu.</p>
<p>Bukavu has 22 camps for Rwandan and Burundian Hutus.</p>
<p>&quot;Nyangezi is the southern-most refugee camp in Bukavu. It is therefore natural that the camp should be affected. The refugees are fleeing because of fears they would be attacked by rebels,&quot; Quintaglie said.</p>
<p>The fighting has fuelled fears that the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry which triggered the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the equally bitter civil war in Burundi could engulf the whole Central African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>The United Nations warned of a looming humanitarian disaster. It evacuated aid workers from Uvira and said food supplies for refugees would last only six days.</p>
<p>&quot;A total of 48 aid workers from United Nations agencies and international non-governmental organisations (NGOS) were evacuated from Uvira. They had been held up for three days in aid agency compounds due to heavy fighting in the area,&quot; a spokesman for the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) told Reuters.</p>
<p>Aid workers would not return until the security situation had improved, he said. &quot;Food distributions will not begin until security conditions allow for WFP staff and other humanitarian workers to return.&quot;</p>
<p>WFP has been providing emergency food rations to all refugees in the 12 camps in Uvira.</p>
<p>The agency also warned that food supplies for refugees in south Kivu, where 221,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutus are on the move, were running out and it only had enough for six days.</p>
<p>The Hutu refugees are likely to seek shelter in surrounding hills, rather than return to nearby Rwanda which they fled in 1994 fearing reprisals for the genocide led by extremist Hutus of hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw tens of thousands of refugees on the road,&quot; Reuters photographer Corinne Dufka said after returning from areas south of Bukavu. &quot;There was a constant and stready stream of Rwandan refugees and displaced Zaireans.&quot;</p>
<p>Dufka and other journalists, who managed to travel 10 km south of Nyangezi on the road towards Uvira, said armed soldiers were walking with the refugees.</p>
<p>There was no reliable death toll from the fighting which flared on Friday. Humanitarian sources said relief workers in Uvira area had asked for 78 body shrouds and had spoken of 60 wounded, mostly civilians.</p>
<p>Earlier reports had 28 civilians killed near Uvira on Friday and a Zairean soldier killed near Goma in the north on Sunday.</p>
<p>Zaire accuses the Tutsi-dominated army in Rwanda of stirring up trouble in its already volatile eastern refugee zone by sending in Banyamulenge infiltrators. Rwanda denies the charge.</p>
<p>The Banyamulenge accuse indigenous Zaireans of trying to force them to leave.</p>
