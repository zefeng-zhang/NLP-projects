<p>Canadian bonds closed slightly weaker on Wednesday, moving in tandem with a softer U.S. market, as anxious investors awaited the release of a key U.S. employment report on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're definitely looking ahead to this big number on Friday. Markets are nervous and volumes aren't huge here. The flows are light today,&quot; said Hank Cunningham, a bond trader with First Marathon Securities.</p>
<p>Canada's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 fell C$0.25 to C$100.55 to yield 7.948 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 13/32 to yield 7.09 percent.  </p>
<p>Canadian economic data released today showing the value of Canadian building permits issued in July rose 7.1 percent had little impact on the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>In auction news, the Government of Canada auction today of C$3.0 billion of 6.25 percent bonds due September 15, 1998 had an average yield of 5.606 percent at an average price of C$101.210.</p>
