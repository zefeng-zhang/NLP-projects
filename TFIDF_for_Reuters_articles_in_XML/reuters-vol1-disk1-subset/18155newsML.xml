<p>The dollar rallied against the yen Wednesday on news of surprising weakness in Japan's economy, but it slipped against the German mark as the outlook for a proposed single European currency continued to worsen.</p>
<p>Japan's widely watched quarterly business outlook survey, or Tankan, fell further into negative territory, while most analysts had expected the report to show economic expansion.</p>
<p>The report squashed talk that Japan would soon raise official interest rates, sinking the yen against the dollar, the mark and the British pound, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The report was much weaker than expected, so people were selling yen and buying everything else,&quot; said Francois Akl, chief currency dealer at Gulf International Bank.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 108.45 yen in late trading from 107.70 late Tuesday, but it fell to 1.4767 marks from 1.4785.</p>
<p>The yen's weakness boosted the mark and the British pound more than the dollar, dealers noted.</p>
<p>Investors flocked to the mark as officials in several European nations hinted they might not meet the strict economic guidelines for joining the European monetary union (EMU) by the January 1999 deadline.</p>
<p>Bad news regarding the EMU's outlook typically helps the mark, since the proposed new European currency, or euro, is seen as supplanting the mark as Europe's premier investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink caused a stir by expressing doubts his nation would join the monetary union on time, boosting the mark, especially against the Swedish crown.</p>
<p>French officials denied rumours they planned to cut taxes to stimulate a sagging economy, which could reverse France's hard-fought progress toward a smaller budget deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a lot of buying marks and selling yen, more than we saw straight dollar buying or selling,&quot; said Oli Enqvist, chief spot currency dealer at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.</p>
<p>The mark rose to a six-week high against the yen at 73.48.</p>
<p>German President Helmut Kohl and Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer each spoke in favour of EMU and strict adherence to the entry criteria late in the trading session, which traders considered an effort to rein in the surging mark.</p>
<p>But the comments appeared to backfire, serving only to heighten EMU concerns and further bolster the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Those assertions drew an even bigger question mark over EMU's validity. They were basically trying to jawbone the market,&quot; said a dollar trader at a European bank in New York.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's chief economist, Otmar Issing, cast doubts on Germany's ability to meet the EMU criteria Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investors also remain convinced that German interest rates have bottomed out and will soon begin rising, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar's failure to rise after a surprisingly large cut in Germany's repo rate to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent last Thursday reflects that concern.</p>
<p>&quot;The mark has remained very strong after the repo cut, which looks like it might be the last one. In the near future, the market's focus will remain on the mark,&quot; Akl said.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar slipped to 1.1927 Swiss francs from 1.1935 Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.5595 from $1.5545.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to Canadian $1.3662 from C$1.3682.</p>
