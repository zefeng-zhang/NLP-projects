<p>President Bill Clinton won backing across the United States on Wednesday for ordering missile strikes against Iraq, but some Americans raised concerns about the long-range U.S. role in the volatile region.</p>
<p>In random interviews, Americans cast Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the role of villain once again, and editorial writers from coast to coast appeared nearly unanimous in backing Clinton's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I think during the (Gulf) war the only people in Iraq who stood up to Saddam Hussein were the Kurds. We abandoned them after we encouraged them,&quot; commented Ronnie Mander on a street in Manhattan. &quot;I think President Clinton is 100 percent correct in going in. Sadam Hussein is not living up to his agreement with the U.N.&quot;</p>
<p>Sean Burnes, director of an international company in Miami, said: &quot;If we'd done it right the first time, we wouldn't be doing this again. I think it has nothing to do with the upcoming U.S. elections. It is purely strategic in protecting our interests.&quot;</p>
<p>A woman in Miami who asked that her name not be used said: &quot;I don't understand why he (Saddam) crossed over the line, but I'm glad that Clinton took such a strong stand.&quot;</p>
<p>A sampling of electronic chatter on the America Online computer service found general support for the president. One cyberspace voyager remarked, &quot;Saddam just won the election for Clinton.&quot;</p>
<p>In Boston, Nicole Feeney, a retail manager, said: &quot;I think something needs to be done about (Saddam) but he keeps going on and on and on.&quot; She said Clinton was &quot;doing the right thing. I don't think there's any other way. You can't talk to (Saddam).&quot;</p>
<p>Joe Russo, a veteran of the second World War from Boston, also endorsed Clinton's action. &quot;They should have finished (Saddam) last time they were there.&quot;</p>
<p>But there were also some concerns expressed.</p>
<p>Dorothy Larson, a retired Pittsburgh business consultant, said: &quot;I think we're getting in over our heads again. This is not a military action; it's a military reaction to something we should have taken care of when we were there before. We can't continue to be the policemen of the world. We can probably count on Great Britain for support but who knows how the rest of our allies will react to our shotgun diplomacy?&quot;</p>
<p>John Hayes, a magazine editor in the Pittsburgh area, said: &quot;The United States should be very cautious in its response because it's an Iraqi internal matter. It could sway world opinion against us if we appear to do something that's beyond our U.N. charter.&quot;</p>
<p>Widely read political columnist Robert Novak, in a commentary published on Wednesday, said Clinton in the long run &quot;is compounding a serious foreign policy dilemma ... inherited from (former President) George Bush. Mideast experts in Washington, inside and outside the government, are deeply concerned about what happens next.&quot;</p>
<p>In Kansas City, Missouri, Bill Onasch said: &quot;I don't think that we really have any business sending our armed forces over to interfere in other countries' affairs.&quot; He said he was worried the conflict could escalate and lead to more casualties on both sides.</p>
<p>Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab-American News, a weekly newspaper based in Dearborn, Michigan, criticised the attack as a political stunt to boost Clinton's presidential campaign. &quot;I believe that this is international piracy. It's a very good example of exercising the law of the jungle,&quot; he said. &quot;The president acted to respond to pressure from within his campaign. It has nothing to do with United Nations resolutions and international law.&quot;</p>
<p>The most common reactions, however, mirrored those of Houston oil refinery worker Tom Gentry, who said: &quot;It's a limited response. I don't think it's too heavy ... an all-out attack would have been uncalled for, but that's easy for me to say because I'm not one of the Kurds getting his butt kicked. It sends a message, and there's more to come if they keep playing that game.&quot;</p>
