<headline>Wall Street ponders Rubin's role if Clinton wins.</headline>

<p>The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected.</p>
<p>Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar.</p>
<p>Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week. Should Rubin leave, Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him.</p>
<p>Rubin's predecessor at the Treasury, Lloyd Bentsen, was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, under the Clinton administration, we've seen two distinctively different dollar policies,&quot; said Chris Widness, an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. &quot;Under Rubin, the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>That strategy, backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention, helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8, 1995, and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19, 1995. Currently, the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen.</p>
<p>Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar's comeback, using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street, part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs and Co. Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubin has done a fine job in that position,&quot; said Michael Faust, a portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl and Kaiser, which manages just under $1 billion in global stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill.&quot;</p>
<p>Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets. Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening.</p>
<p>As for U.S. Treasury securities, Widness explained that Alan Greenspan's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury.</p>
<p>&quot;Although, if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation, it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States,&quot; said Widness, adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and, to a lesser degree, bonds.</p>
<p>Still, markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results. If that is true, then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency.</p>
<p>&quot;If he left, the first question people would ask the next guy is, 'What's your view on the dollar?'&quot; said Michael Perelstein, portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds.</p>
<p>&quot;And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they'd better say exactly the same thing (as Rubin), if not stronger,&quot; Perelstein said. &quot;Otherwise, you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again.&quot;</p>
