<p>Another day of encouraging news for owners saw the flourishing Panamax routes in the BFI push the index up a further 17 points on Tuesday to 1238.</p>
<p>Brokers said interest in Panamaxes for period business underpinned this market and there were signs some Caper trades were also strengthening. Modern Handy-sizes in the North Atlantic continued to benefit from greater chartering demand.</p>
<p>GRAIN - Capers continued to take a hand in firm North Atlantic grain trades. Brokers said Toepfer fixed Commander for 80,000 heavy grain Mississippi/Hamburg at $12.00 for Nov 13/30.</p>
<p>This followed reports Wednesday of what traders now understand was  Glencore's fixture of Flag Mersinidi for 90,000 barley Continent/Jeddah for Oct loading at $16.00 basis 2-1</p>
<p>(Corrects from &quot;..Soufflet's fixture of Flag Mersinidi..&quot;)</p>
<p>Iranian charterers Irisl have booked Nega Hill 80,000 wheat St Lawrence/Iran for Mid Oct on subjects at $19.00 but reports of the fixture of Regina 129,000 dwt in grain were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Panamax rates still appeared to be rising in the Atlantic although Olympic Galaxy 64,000 dwt again failed on subjects delivery prompt Passero trip via US Gulf to the far East at $11,750 daily (with Halla).</p>
<p>Georgios 63,000 dwt fixed but also failed on subjects delivery Aughinish end Oct trip via US Gulf to Taiwan at $12,000 daily (with NSAC).</p>
<p>Dreyfus were said to have taken the chip-carrier World Wood for about 45,000 meals US Gulf/China at a higher $24.00 and Hanjin were firm this morning for 52-54,000 heavy grain US Gulf/Japan for mid Nov at $23.00 no combo.</p>
<p>Higher rates were reported paid for Oct heavy grain loaders by Cargill 45,000 USGulf/Continent at $14.00 and by Cereol 50,000 heavy grain St Lawrence to Ghent at $12.00 (Toepfer last week fixed Anangel Omoniia 70,000 St Lawrence/Holland at $7.40).</p>
<p>Continental were believed to have booked a Panamax for grain from Nopac to Trincomalee and to be working another for grain from NSW to Aqaba.</p>
<p>Andre were especially active in the Handy-sizes covering 25,000 wheat Rouen/Port Sudan for Oct/Nov at $28.00, 20,000 wheat St Lawrence/Casablanca on subjects for end Oct at close to $15.50, and about 28,000 Plate/S.Africa on private terms. Italgrani fixed 15,000 plus 6,000 wheat Lakes-St Lawrence/Italy at $26.00/$19.00 and 16/16,500 wheat Rouen/Savona-Manfredonia at $13.50.</p>
<p>MINERALS -Firmer Caper fixtures were reported with Ocean Irene obtaining $6.25 from Cobelfret for 180,000 coal Richards Bay/Rotterdam for Dec loading (up from $5.25 last fixed for a smaller size for Nov), and United Resolve 150,149 dwt delivery China mid Nov trip via Richards Bay to the Continent taken by MOSK at $9,650 daily (equivalent to over $6.25 Richards Bay/Rotterdam).</p>
<p>Reports circulated that Korea Line booked Nord Sea 140,000 dwt delivery Skaw mid Nov trip via Brazil to China at about $14,500 daily, but others believed the charterers took the vessel for 4-6 months.</p>
<p>Some brokers expressed doubts about the continued improvement in freight rates for Panamaxes from South Africa on the grounds that available orders were drying up and quite a number of vessels were becoming free in the middle East.</p>
<p>But in the Pacific and North Atlantic there appeared to be no such concerns - the Showa-relet South Fortune 69,000 dwt fixed prompt Japan for a petcoke round voyage via Los Angeles at $10,000 daily and Antonis I Angelicoussis 69,000 dwt went to Shinwa with similar delivery for a Nopac round at $9,500 daily.</p>
<p>In the Atlantic Noble booked Giovanni Bottiglieri 73,000 dwt on subjects prompt Continent for a trip via US Gulf to China with fertilizers at $13,000 daily and NASC fixed Maritime Wisdom 73,465 dwt delivery Poland for a trip via Ventspils also with fertilizers to China at $12,900 daily.</p>
<p>Forum Glory 69,925 dwt may have been covered by Norsk Hydro for a fertilizer trip to the far East.</p>
<p>Reports of the fixture of Banya 73,000 dwt from West Mediterranean via US Gulf to the far East with Halla at $13,750 daily were incorrect - the vessel has been indicating this level delivery Alexandria early Nov for such business.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports emerged of Klaveness booking Montauk 64,976 dwt delivery Med second half Nov for 6-8 months at $8,500 daily, and Deuilemar may have fixed Rova 50,000 dwt for bauxite business from Kamsar to Point Comfort.</p>
