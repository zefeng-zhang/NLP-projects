<p>British Prime Minister John Major gave a gloomy assessment on Wednesday of the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland and warned the IRA that &quot;soft words&quot; alone would not earn its political allies a seat at the talks table.</p>
<p>Major has made the search for a lasting political settlement in the British-ruled province a personal crusade during his six years as prime minister.</p>
<p>But as parliament opened for the last session before Britain's general election, Major sounded pessimistic about the chances of restoring momentum to a peace process that has been stalled since the Irish Republican Army resumed bombing British targets in February.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't look into the minds of the terrorists and predict what they will do. But I do know that the road to a settlement will not be easy,&quot; Major said.</p>
<p>He said the IRA, by shattering its 17-month ceasefire, had excluded itself and its political wing, Sinn Fein, from multi-party talks that started in Belfast in June.</p>
<p>&quot;But the talks will continue without them. The IRA and Sinn Fein should be under no illusion that they can join the process until they have demonstrated real commitment to democratic and non-violent methods.</p>
<p>&quot;So even if a new ceasefire is declared, there will have to be more than soft words to convince the government -- and, I believe, this House -- that it does not represent another tactical device to be abandoned at any convenient moment,&quot; said Major, who must call an election by May 22.</p>
<p>He was speaking a day after a London police chief said Britain faced &quot;dangerous months&quot; in which IRA guerrillas could launch further attacks on the British mainland.</p>
<p>And Northern Ireland's chief policeman, Sir Hugh Annesley warned in an interview on Monday that IRA guerrillas would attempt fresh bomb attacks before laying down their arms again.</p>
<p>Tony Blair, leader of the main opposition Labour party and favourite to win the election, earlier called on the IRA to renew its ceasefire.</p>
<p>&quot;I would add my call to the calls of others for Sinn Fein and the IRA to take the path of peace. Unless they do, the search for peace and reconciliation will continue without them.</p>
<p>&quot;They should call a ceasefire immediately and if the latest threats of a bombing campaign are true, the IRA need to understand that neither this House nor any party within it will ever give in to terrorism or the threat of terrorism,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blair pledged continued bipartisan support for the government in its search for peace and said it would back a planned bill on ways of scrapping guerrilla weapons.</p>
