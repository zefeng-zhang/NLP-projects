<p>The key December Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract ended the Tokyo session with hefty gains after setting an all-time high for any benchmark of 123.70, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The aggressive advance of the December was led by unwinding of short JGBs and the long Nikkei 225 futures contract built by foreign speculators in the last week, traders said.</p>
<p>The poor showing in Sunday's election of Shinshinto, which opposed a consumption tax rise and wanted income tax cuts, was positive for the debt market, traders said. A Shinshinto win could have boosted spending and put upward pressure on rates.  </p>
<p>A good performance by the Liberal Democratic Party in the poll was also positive for bonds. The LDP on Sunday raised its strength to 239 seats, though still short of the 251 it had needed to govern alone in the 500-seat Lower House.</p>
<p>Shoji Kitta, managing director of Tokyo Tanshi Co Ltd, Japan's largest money broker, said: &quot;The LDP is seeking to maintain a partnership with the Social Democrats and Sakigake in a new coalition, suggesting interest rates will stay capped, as such a coalition would only accentuate the slow pace of recovery.&quot; This is because the LDP's partners have been opposing policies to raise liquidity in land transactions.  </p>
<p>But unless the liquidity of land is raised, a healthy economic recovery is unlikely to be achieved, as a lack of land liquidity is at the core of the nation's bad loan problem, Kitta said. In consequence, rates will stay low, he added.</p>
<p>In afternoon trade, a round of short-covering by overseas hedge funds drove up the December to its record high of 123.70, traders said. Speculative accounts, on the other hand, were unloading Nikkei 225 futures on the SIMEX, they said. The funds built short JGB positions in the last week, while boosting longs in the Nikkei 225 in expectation that the LDP would win an overall majority in the election.  </p>
<p>The market is cautious about a possible government decision to implement a supplementary budget in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>A senior LDP official said before the election that a supplementary budget of about five trillion yen should be considered. But such worries faded, at least temporarily, amid bullish bond market sentiment on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will worry about it (the budget) later, because the new government is unlikely to make any quick decision even on who gets a seat in the cabinet,&quot; said a city bank trader.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is expected to hold an auction for 10-year JGBs on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The December ended at 123.58, after moving in 122.91-123.70 range. Its turnover was 56,048 contracts.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year JGB was at 2.745 percent, down sharply from 2.805 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the cash market, there was talk that public funds bought long-term JGBs from the market, underscoring the bullish market mood, traders said.</p>
