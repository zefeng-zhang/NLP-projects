<title>PHILIPPINES: Manila to sign Moslem peace accord Sept 2.</title>

<p>A peace pact ending a 24-year Moslem rebellion in the southern Philippines is expected to be signed in Jakarta on August 30 followed by a ceremonial signing in Manila on September 2, President Fidel Ramos said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The presidential palace said Ramos had invited Hamid Algabid, secretary general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), to be a signatory to the accord.</p>
<p>An OIC panel chaired by Indonesia is mediating the talks between Manila and the insurgent Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).</p>
<p>The signing of the agreement will take place after a final round of talks in the Indonesian capital, a palace statement said.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for the setting up of an administrative council in 14 provinces in the southern Mindanao region as a precursor to a Moslem regional autonomous government the MNLF is demanding as a condition for ending the rebellion.</p>
<p>Manila's recent announcement of its agreement to install a rebel-led council has sparked widespread protests among Christian residents of Mindanao.</p>
<p>The country's six million Moslems regard the southern region as their ancestral homeland although they have become a minority in the area after decades of Christian migration.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that a smooth process of finalisation will ensue in Jakarta and our government panel looks forward to your Excellency's indspensable presence in the initialling ceremony (in Jakarta),&quot; Ramos said in his letter to Algabid.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to your Excellency's kind acceptance of our invitation to the signing of the final peace agrement to be held at Malacanang (presidential) palace, Manila, on September 2,&quot; according to the letter, excerpts of which were released by the palace.</p>
<p>Ramos thanked Algabid for his help in drawing up the peace agreement.</p>
<p>More than 125,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the rebellion which broke out in October 1972 after then president Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law.</p>
