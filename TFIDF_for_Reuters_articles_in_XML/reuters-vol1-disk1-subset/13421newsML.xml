<title>USA: Stocks down on renewed interest rate jitters.</title>
<headline>Stocks down on renewed interest rate jitters.</headline>

<p>Stock prices followed bonds lower Monday as Wall Street was again hounded by Friday's news of a surprisingly strong July durable goods report, which sent long-term interest rates to their highest levels in more than three weeks.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 28.85 points to 5,693.89. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 12-7 on subdued volume of 155 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index was off 3.70 to 1,139.35 and the American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.65 to 560.29.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond was off 8/32 and its yield rose to 6.97 percent from 6.95 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a reaction to the bond market,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;Certainly there's a bit more nervousness about whether interest rates will go up before the election.&quot;</p>
<p>Inflation-sensitive bond yields shot up to a three-week highs as July durable goods orders rose 1.6 percent, against expectations of a 0.3 percent rise.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a rather jittery market if it is willing to change course on just one number,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;Conviction levels are lower and therefore the market is going to be vulnerable to short-term swings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the midst of the gloom, tobacco companies showed signs of life after the industry's victory late Friday in an Indiana liability lawsuit.</p>
<p>While the verdict itself was a small victory, it may provide a temporary breather for the beleaguered industry, analysts said. Philip Morris Cos. gained 3-1/4 to 91-1/4 and RJR Nabisco Holdings rose 1-1/8 to 26-5/8.</p>
<p>Telecommunications stocks were also very active after MFS Communications Co. and WorldCom Inc. agreed to merge, creating a fourth giant in the long-distance telephone business.</p>
<p>News of the deal, under which WorldCom will swap 2.1 shares for each MFS share, sent MFS soaring 10 points to 44-7/8. WorldCom shares slid four points to 22-3/8.</p>
<p>Analysts said the transaction was likely to heighten investor interest in the rest of the sector and telecom stocks were among the NYSE and Nasdaq most-active lists.</p>
<p>&quot;This heats up the merger outlook for other telephone companies,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>MCI Communications, which announced that it would buy 10 billion minutes of wireless communications capacity from NextWave Telecom Inc. for resale to its own customers, rose 1/8 to 25-5/8 on volume of 2.2 million shares.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp. lost one point to 53-5/8 and Sprint Corp. eased 1/8 to 39-3/4, while Teleport Communications Group Inc. surged 2-1/2 to 24-3/4.</p>
