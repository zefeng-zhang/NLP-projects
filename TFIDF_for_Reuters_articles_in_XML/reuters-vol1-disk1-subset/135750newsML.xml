<p>Klaus Augenthaler, Bayern Munich's assistant coach and former World Cup libero, is almost certain to leave the German club after more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Augenthaler, who played in Germany's 1990 World Cup winning team, has been told  his contract will not be renewed at the end of the season, the German sports magazine Sport Bild reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I told him: `Klaus, you can't be assistant coach at Bayern for ever',&quot; the magazine quoted chairman Franz Beckenbauer as saying. &quot;`You have to take on a team for yourself...You are capable of leading another team.'&quot;</p>
<p>Augenthaler joined Bayern as a teenager in 1975 and was capped 27 times.</p>
<p>After finishing his playing career he has worked as assistant for the past five years under several coaches. The current Bayern trainer is Italian Giovanni Trapattoni.</p>
