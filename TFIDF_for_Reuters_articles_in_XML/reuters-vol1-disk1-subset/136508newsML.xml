<p>Russia's state security service chief Nikolai Kovalyov said on Wednesday that the situation in the breakaway Chechnya region represented a &quot;serious danger&quot; and warned of terrorism spreading across the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a danger of terrorism spreading across Russian territory and we are taking steps to prevent extremist actions,&quot; the Federal Security Service (FSB) director told a meeting between his agency and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>&quot;We have carried out many operations recently to prevent such actions,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Kovalyov said one of his agency's priorities was to cooperate with the government and the influential Security Council on stabilising the situation in Chechnya after the halt to military activities there.</p>
<p>But his warning of a terrorist threat appeared to cast doubt over the results of a peace deal signed on August 31 by President Boris Yeltsin's former security supremo Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>The deal ended almost 21 months of fighting in which Lebed says up to 100,000 people have been killed. But it has been criticised by the State Duma lower chamber of parliament, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and other Lebed rivals.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, preparing for heart surgery in late November, gave Lebed's plan cautious approval before sacking the ex-paratroop general last week for insubordination and sowing discord in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Lebed, who won the respect of the Chechen rebel leaders, was replaced at the weekend by Ivan Rybkin as secretary of the Security Council and as Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya.</p>
<p>Rybkin, a moderate politician who has pledged to build on Lebed's achievements in Chechnya, sent a message of peace to the separatist leaders through an international mediator on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Interfax said he discussed Chechnya with Tim Guldimann, head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Chechnya-based mission.</p>
<p>The Security Council press service said Rybkin had asked Guldimann to pass on a verbal message when he returned to the Chechen capital Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;The secretary of Russia's Security Council stressed the desire for a continuation of the peace process based on regular and constructive work,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;He underlined the desire for a continuation of the peace process, allowing regular and constructive work. Suggestions were also made for proposed meetings,&quot; it said, but gave no details.</p>
<p>Under Lebed's deal with Maskhadov, most Russian troops are to withdraw from Chechnya, prisoners are to be exchanged and discussion of the main issue of whether or not Chechnya remains in Russia will be postponed for five years.</p>
<p>Interfax said Rybkin and Guldimann discussed cooperation between Rybkin's office and a newly-created joint commission grouping officials from the Russian government and the separatists.</p>
