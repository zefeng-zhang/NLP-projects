<p>Sweden's central bank on Tuesday stuck to its monetary policy guns by delivering the 22nd cut this year in its key repo rate, trimming the rate by 10 basis points to 4.85 percent.</p>
<p>The move was widely expected by financial markets but some players had been waiting for a change in policy hinted at by deputy Riksbank governor Lars Heikensten in a speech earlier this month.</p>
<p>Heikensten implied that the bank's policy was not set in stone. (Corrects reference to Heikensten speaking on Tuesday.)</p>
<p>&quot;You can't always expect monetary policy to follow a fixed pattern in the future,&quot; he said, creating a degree of uncertainty in the markets.</p>
<p>Many analysts interpreted this to mean that the central bank would depart from its pattern, established in April, of cutting its central repo rate every other week, most recently in 10 basis point tranches.</p>
<p>&quot;The comments made by Heikensten were over-analysed by the market, initially optimistically and then more pessimistically,&quot; Swedbank analyst Peter Granqvist said. &quot;It was a pre-emptive remark made to give the bank room for manoeuvre in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuesday's cut was announced in the Riksbank's latest weekly reverse repurchase tender, the central bank's key tool in controlling liquidity on the money market.</p>
<p>With inflation running at just 0.2 percent in September, the lowest rate of any European Union member, the Riksbank has been free to implement an aggressive policy of rate cuts since January in an attempt to revive the flagging economy.</p>
<p>The repo rate has been cut by more than four percentage points from the level of 8.91 percent at which it began the year. The central bank's deposit and lending rates have fallen accordingly.</p>
<p>But with the floor and ceiling of the rate corridor now pegged at 4.75 and 6.25 percent, respectively, the Riksbank has run out of room for further trimming of the central repo rate.</p>
<p>Most analysts expect the bank to lower the corridor by 1/2 percentage point at its next board meeting on Thursday, although one analyst in a recent Reuter poll said the cut could be as much as 3/4 percentage point.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything else would come as a surprise to the market, since we've only got 10 basis points left. At the moment, you don't have a corridor,&quot; one Stockholm-based analyst said.</p>
<p>Swedbank's Granqvist said the bank was unlikely to change policy radically in the near future, since its monetary policy was designed to take effect over a 12- to 18-month horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;From their point of view, 10 basis points from week to week isn't going to make a great deal of difference. They want an effect that is plastered out over time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A recent Reuter poll showed that most analysts expect the repo rate to bottom out at between 4.00 and 4.60 percent in early 1997, pulling down short-term market rates in its wake.</p>
<p>The rate on the six-month Treasury bill is seen falling by around 20 basis points from Tuesday's level of 4.53 percent.</p>
<p>Longer rates are also expected to fall, with the nine-year bond yield dipping to 7.06 percent within the coming three months and then continuing down to 6.85 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the nine-year yield would reach bottom at that level and return to 7.42 percent in a year's time.</p>
