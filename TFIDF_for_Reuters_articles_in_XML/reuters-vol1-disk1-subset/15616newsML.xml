<p>A day after disgraced former president Chun Doo Hwan was sentenced to death on charges of mutiny and treason, his defence lawyers on Tuesday were studying ways to challenge the court ruling.</p>
<p>Neither Chun nor his presidential successor Roh Tae-woo, sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison on similar charges stemming from a 1979 military coup and an army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in the city of Kwangju the following year, have yet lodged formal appeals.</p>
<p>&quot;The defence team is studying whether to appeal against the sentence,&quot; an aide to Lee Yang-woo, Chun's defence lawyer, said by telephone.</p>
<p>But media reports said lawyers of Chun and Roh were already preparing to challenge the rulings and that the appeals could drag through the courts for up to eight months.</p>
<p>The lawyers were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The sentences would be confirmed if the defendants failed to appeal within seven days after the rulings.</p>
<p>State prosecutors said on Tuesday they would decide by the end of this week whether to appeal Roh's sentence. They had demanded life in jail.</p>
<p>Few Koreans think Chun will hang, and there is intense speculation over whether President Kim Young-sam will end one of the most traumatic chapters in modern Korean history by offering both men a clemency before he steps down next year.</p>
<p>President Kim would have to weigh public disgust for Chun and Roh against the support both men still have in their home provinces.</p>
<p>However, popular anger against the former generals is waning, partly because the trial threw up so much evidence to show they were simply at the tip of a pyramid of corruption that touched almost every layer of society.</p>
<p>&quot;The rule of law is important but political virtue and generosity are as much important as that,&quot; said Moon Chung-in, a professor of politics at Yonsei University.</p>
<p>He said President Kim and his ruling New Korea Party would have nothing to gain if the sentences were carried out.</p>
<p>Moon was echoing sentiment in some quarters that the one-time military academy classmates had suffered enough, and that to hound them further would be unnecessarily cruel.</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-soo, a professor at Kookmin University, said the court rulings could help stabilise domestic politics by backing up President Kim's campaign to put history to rights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the country's top business tycoons who received jail terms on Monday on charges of giving bribes to Roh during his presidency, began appealing against their sentences to the Seoul District Criminal Court.</p>
<p>A court official said Jinro group chairman Chang Jin-ho and Hanbo group's honorary chairman Chung Tae-soo on Tuesday submitted appeals to the three-judge panel that sentenced each of them to two years in prison.</p>
<p>&quot;They said they were appealing against the jail sentences which they cannot accept,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Chang and Chung were among nine business tycoons convicted of bribing Roh.</p>
<p>Daewoo group chairman Kim Woo-choong was also sentenced to two years in jail and Choi Won-suk, head of Dong-Ah group, to 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>The other five, including Samsung group chairman Lee Kun-hee, received suspended jail sentences.</p>
