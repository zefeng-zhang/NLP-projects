<p>The Justice Department said Tuesday that three companies and three of their executives have agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $20 million in criminal fines as part of the government's price-fixing investigation involving Archer Daniels Midland Co..</p>
<p>It said Ajinomoto Co. Inc. and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd., both based in Tokyo, and the U.S. unit of the South Korean firm Sewon Company Ltd. agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix prices to eliminate competition in the worldwide market for lysine, an animal feed supplement.</p>
<p>The department said the three corporations have agreed to cooperate fully with the investigation by providing documents and witnesses who will be available to testify in the United States. All of the defendants already have started cooperating, department officials said.</p>
<p>The department has been conducting a long-running investigation into allegations of lysine price-fixing involving ADM and a number of its top executives.</p>
<p>ADM, an agricultural giant based in Decatur, Illinois, with more than $12 billion in annual sales, declined to comment. Since the probe was first announced in June 1995, ADM has denied any wrongdoing and says it is cooperating fully.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the department's first action against international cartel activity in the food and feed additive industry,&quot; Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;It sends a message to the entire world that criminal collusive behaviour that harms U.S. consumers will not be tolerated,&quot; he said, announcing the plea agreements have been signed and the criminal case has been filed in federal court in Chicago.</p>
<p>Asked specificially about ADM in light of the new developments, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona would only say, &quot;Our investigation continues.&quot;</p>
<p>In a separate proceeding, ADM agreed in April to pay $25 million to settle a civil lysine price-fixing lawsuit brought by its customers as part of an overall $45 million settlement that also involved Ajinomoto and Kyowa Hakko. ADM agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying guilt.</p>
<p>The charges to be settled by the plea bargain announced Tuesday alleged that the defendants conspired among themselves and with unnamed co-conspirators to suppress and eliminate competition in the lysine market from June 1992 until June last year, in violation of federal antitrust laws.</p>
<p>The department charged that the defendants and the unnamed co-conspirators:</p>
<p>-- held meetings and conversations to discuss prices and volumes of lysine sold in the United States and elsewhere;</p>
<p>-- agreed to charge prices at certain levels and to increase lysine prices;</p>
<p>-- agreed to allocate among the firms the volume of lysine to be sold;</p>
<p>-- issued price announcements and price quotations in accordance with the agreements;</p>
<p>-- and participated in meetings and conversations aimed at monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices and sales volumes.</p>
<p>The plea agreements, in which the three firms and the three executives admitted their guilt, must be accepted by a federal judge in Chicago.</p>
<p>Ajinomoto and Kyowa Hakko each have agreed to pay the maximum fine of $10 million while Sewon America will pay as much as the judge deems it can reasonably afford, the department said.</p>
<p>Also agreeing to plead guilty were Kanji Mimoto, Ajinomoto's former general manager of the feed additives division; Masaru Yamamoto, the former general manager of Kyowa Hakko's agricultural products department; and Jhom Su Kim, president of Sewon America Inc.</p>
