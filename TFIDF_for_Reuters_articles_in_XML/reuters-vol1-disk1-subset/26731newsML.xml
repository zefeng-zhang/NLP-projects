<title>UK: FOOTBALL IS LATEST EMERGING MARKET FOR NOMURA.</title>
<headline>FOOTBALL IS LATEST EMERGING MARKET FOR NOMURA.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's new football season has provided the latest emerging market -- soccer club shares, a trend spotted by Nomura chief equity strategist Nick Knight.</p>
<p>&quot;One for aficionados only initially, our thesis that the combination of fundamentals plus reasonable valuations plus rising market capitalisation would broaden appeal to institutional investors with no particular interest in the game itself seems to be coming true,&quot; Knight said in a research note.</p>
<p>Knight, a West Ham supporter, notes that, as with all emerging markets, liquidity in the shares is a problem, but he says that in the first two weeks of the English league season his Football Clubs Index has risen 2.2 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent fall in the FTSE-100 index of top British shares.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of absolute performance is not to be sneezed at, and given the strong support to the sector -- in particular the BSkyB deal and some promising attendance figures -- it seems a highly suitable vehicle to ride out the potential downside in the broader market,&quot; Knight said.</p>
<p>News Corp's BSkyB has signed a 670-million-stg deal to televise England's Premier League for the next five years.</p>
<p>Sadly for Knight, his beloved West Ham United is standing 12th out of the 20 teams in the Premier League. -- David Chance London newsroom 44 171 542 5887</p>
