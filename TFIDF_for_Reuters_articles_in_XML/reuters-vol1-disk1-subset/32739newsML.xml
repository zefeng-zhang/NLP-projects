<p>The Philippines' tender offer to exchange $1.9 billion of its Brady bonds for uncollateralized Eurobonds got a positive but low-keyed reception from the U.S. investment community.</p>
<p>&quot;The major impact of this exchange offer is on changing investors' sentiment and on rearranging maturity of the sovereign debt,&quot; said Suhas Ketkar, a managing director at CS First Boston Corp.  </p>
<p>The upside potential for the Philippines bonds, however, is seen as limited, because they are priced at very tight spreads to U.S. Treasures relative to the country's credit standing, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The Philippine Bradies already trade like investment grade papers,&quot; said one Brady trader.</p>
<p>With a double-B rating, Philippine Par bonds at 82-5/8 had a stripped yield of 225 basis points, whereas triple-B rated Poland Pars at 51.00, traded at a stripped yield of 213 basis points.  </p>
<p>The minimum tender price was set at 225 basis points over U.S. Treasuries for the fixed 20-year bond and 175 basis points over LIBOR for 15-year floating rate notes, according to trading sources.</p>
<p>The clearing spread for the fixed bond is expected to be around 200 basis points, they said.</p>
<p>The invitation to tender the Brady bonds began on September 2 and expires on September 20.  Acceptance of offers will be announced on September 20 and settlement made on October 7.  </p>
<p>Tom Trebat, head of emerging markets research at Citi Securites, said the Philippine central bank has a good track record of actively managing sovereign debt.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an adroit attempt to pin down the outer end of an yield curve,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At present, the Philippines has little need to go beyond 20 years in maturity, which is already longer than most Philippine corporate debt issuance, Trebat noted.</p>
<p>Unlike the excitement over the Mexican debt swap in April, the Philippines version received a polite nod and a yawn.  </p>
<p>&quot;Philippine yields are not attractive to dedicated emerging market funds,&quot; said a trader. &quot;The papers are illiquid (Corrects from liquid), compared to the umpteenth bigger Latin market.&quot;</p>
<p>It is likely that most of the tenders will come from banks in Asia or Philippine offshore investments, he said.</p>
<p>Feroz Talyarkhan, coordinator of Asian fixed income research at Bear Stearns and Co Inc, said U.S. investors often buy Philippine bonds for diversification and keep them in their portfolios.  </p>
<p>The exchange offer serves a publicity purpose as it calls attention to the country's recent achievement in clinching a peace accord with Moslem guerrillas and making breathtaking economic progress which shines even among fast-growing Asian economies, he said.</p>
<p>The Philippine gross national product rose 7.1 percent in the first half of 1996, after a 5.8-percent rise in 1995.</p>
<p>The improving fundamentals have received due recognition by rating agencies, but more can be reasonably expected, Talyarkhan said.</p>
<p>In February, Moody's Investors Service Inc upgraded the Philippines' long-term foreign currency debt to Ba2 from Ba3, and Standard and Poor's lifted its rating to BB from BB-minus.</p>
<p>&quot;It's possible to see another sovereign upgrade next year,&quot; Talyarkhan added.</p>
