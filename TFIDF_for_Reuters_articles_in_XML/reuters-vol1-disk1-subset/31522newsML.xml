<p>Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army used helicopter gunships and mortars to battle Hutu rebels in fresh fighting to the east of the capital Bujumbura on Wednesday, an army spokesman and residents said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fighting started up (again) around three p.m. (1300 GMT) and it is fairly intensive,&quot; army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi told Reuters. He said the fighting was continuing.</p>
<p>Nibizi said the latest fighting, which followed heavy clashes between the army and rebels last night, started after the rebels assaulted targets on the eastern outskirts of Bujumbura city and the army sent reinforcements to tackle them.</p>
<p>Residents said they saw helicopters take to the skies to hit rebel positions and heard mortars being used in the latest battle around Tshiangano, a few kilometres (miles) from the city.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent said he saw smoke rising from the steep hills east of Bujumbura.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night the Hutu rebels of the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) launched what residents said was the fiercest engagement since a July 25 coup but the army said on earlier on Wednesday that they had been repelled.</p>
<p>Innocent Nimpagaritse, spokesman for the exiled National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), told Reuters the CNDD military wing used rocket-propelled grenades to attack the army in a stepped-up campaign against Burundi's Tutsi military government.</p>
<p>Nimpagaritse said the CNDD's military wing -- Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) -- had taken the battle to the capital after driving the army out of Burundi's Kayanza region, a scene of heavy fighting in the last five days.</p>
