<p>An estimated 32,000 Singaporeans hopped, skipped and jumped in time to music on Sunday in a mass outdoor aerobic workout designed to encourage the nation to keep fit.</p>
<p>Dressed in red and white clothing, the colours of the national flag, the participants, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and several members of his cabinet, then took part in a 3.3 km (two-mile) walk.</p>
<p>Officials said the &quot;Great Singapore Workout&quot;, which has been held annually since 1993, attracted far more participants than in previous years. State television estimated the total attendance at around 32,000.</p>
<p>A similar event in 1995 broke the World Guiness record for the largest aerobics/gymnastics display with 30,517 participants.</p>
<p>Goh told reporters after the workout he had been pleased by the large number of young people taking part.</p>
<p>&quot;The youths are coming out. They are setting the lead and they (will) then acquire the habit of exercising, of coming into the open and enjoying the fresh air and sun,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to encourage them.&quot;</p>
<p>The director of the Ministry of Health's &quot;Healthy Lifestyle Unit&quot;, K. Vijaya who organised the workout, said such events had helped improve the fitness of Singaporeans.</p>
<p>She told Reuters the number of Singaporeans doing some sort of regular exercise had increased and the level of obesity in children had fallen since the annual workouts were first organised.</p>
