<p>Lebanon's new parliament began work on Tuesday, re-electing pro-Syrian Shi'ite Moslem leader Nabih Berri to a second term as speaker before preparing to appoint a new prime minister.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri was widely expected to be nominated to a third term of office later this week.</p>
<p>A presidential palace statement said President Elias Hrawi would hold formal consultations with parliamentary deputies on choosing the new prime minister on Wednesday and Thursday. Hrawi must nominate the candidate chosen by a majority of deputies.</p>
<p>The statement said consultations would be completed by one p.m. (1100 GMT) on Thursday. This could enable Hrawi to name the premier before the arrival that evening of French President Jacques Chirac on a visit to Beirut, political sources said.</p>
<p>Hrawi travelled to Damascus on Tuesday and held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the stalled Middle East peace process, Syrian officials said.</p>
<p>The 128-member parliament, dominated by pro-Syrian deputies, voted 121-0 with four abstentions at its first meeting to reappoint Berri, a civil war militia leader considered Syria's closest political ally in Lebanon.</p>
<p>The parliament, elected in five rounds of voting in August and September, includes 49 newcomers. Many members are wealthy businessmen who ran on government-backed lists of candidates but 19 seats are still being contested in the courts following widespread allegations of electoral fraud.</p>
<p>Eighteen losing candidates have appealed to the Constitutional Council to cancel the victories of their rivals and declare them elected, alleging fraud and intimidation, mostly by pro-government forces.</p>
<p>Another defeated candidate has asked the council to cancel the entire election on grounds that the law under which it was held was unconstitutional and that voting was subject to intolerable fraud.</p>
<p>With 35 millionaires and three billionaires among its members, the new parliament is probably one of the wealthiest in the world.</p>
<p>Hariri, who stepped down routinely last week to make way for the selection of a new prime minister and government by the new parliament, is expected to form a new government by the end of the month.</p>
<p>He has held office since October 1992, launching a reconstruction drive that has made big strides towards rebuilding Lebanon from the ruins of the 1975-90 civil war.</p>
<p>His continuance in power is widely considered indispensable if Lebanon is to continue its recovery, despite warnings from some politicians, labour unionists, clerics and commentators that he must pay more attention to social problems and poverty.</p>
