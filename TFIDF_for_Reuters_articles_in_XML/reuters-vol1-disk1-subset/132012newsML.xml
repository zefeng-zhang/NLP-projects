<headline>INTERVIEW-Fidelity sees value in Indonesia stocks.</headline>
<dateline>NUSA DUA, Indonesia 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>The world's leading mutual funds company, Fidelity Investments, has said Indonesian stocks have good but not exceptional value and looked attractive in the longer-term.</p>
<p>&quot;We think Indonesia is good value. But we don't think it has exceptional value,&quot; Stuart Leckie, chairman of Fidelity Investments, told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. &quot;In the long-term, it is attractive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think it's overvalued. Our weighting is just about in line with the emerging market index,&quot; Leckie said.</p>
<p>Leckie said he had been very pleased with developments in Indonesia since the stock market was liberalised and deregulated in 1988.</p>
<p>&quot;I think since then the market has developed very well indeed,&quot; he said during a conference on the island of Bali on capital flows to the region.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things which need to be clarified in due course is the succesion plan,&quot; Leckie said, referring to the question over who would succeed long-ruling President Suharto.</p>
<p>Suharto, 75, has been in power since the mid-1960s and he has no obvious successors.</p>
<p>Leckie said he would also like to see more deregulation in pension fund laws.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesia wants to attract foreign pension funds, why not allow local pension funds to invest abroad,&quot; Leckie said.</p>
<p>Leckie said Fidelity had no plan to open an office in Indonesia in the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very interested in Indonesia. In the medium-term we might have a presence here,&quot; he said.</p>
