<p>General Motors Corp. and the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union said on Monday they had resolved the thorny issue of outsourcing and were close to a full labour agreement.</p>
<p>CAW President Buzz Hargrove, asked if a deal were likely by the noon (1600 GMT) deadline agreed by the two sides, told Reuters, &quot;I'd say that was a fair assessment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have resolved the issue of outsourcing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said there was enough of an agreement on outsourcing for him to be confident of an overall deal that meets the labour agreement pattern the union set at Chrysler Corp. earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is enough common ground for the CAW to say they have met the pattern and hopefully our needs as well,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>Both sides cautioned that there were still sticking points that could derail the talks, such as overtime rules at the Oshawa, Ontario, complex of the world's largest carmaker.</p>
