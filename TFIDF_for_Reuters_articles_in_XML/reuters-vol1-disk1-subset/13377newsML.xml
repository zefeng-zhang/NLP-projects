<p>Sri Lanka is considering outlawing Tamil Tiger rebels to strengthen its hand against the separatist group as Washington promises to curb rebel activity on U.S. soil, officials and analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Political analyst Paikiyasothi Saravanamuttu said banning the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east, would close the door to peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;This is talking tough,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga summoned a special cabinet meeting to discuss banning the LTTE last week but put off making a decision, government officials said without giving reasons.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the government had not outlawed the LTTE because it wanted to leave open the option of resuming talks with the rebels to end the 13-year-old war in which the government says more than 50,000 people have died.</p>
<p>The Tigers broke off peace talks in April last year, refusing to look at a government peace plan which offers Tamils extensive autonomy.</p>
<p>&quot;Consider also the international impact of the ban,&quot; Saravanamuttu said. &quot;It would take care of foreign governments saying they can't take action against the LTTE in their countries because the LTTE is not banned in Sri Lanka.&quot;</p>
<p>Western governments have told Sri Lanka that they cannot crack down on rebel fund raising and other activities on their soil as long as the LTTE does not break the law and remains a legal organisation in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The plan to ban the LTTE comes as some Western governments take an increasingly critical view of the rebels.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka said on Friday Washington had promised to stamp out illegal activities on U.S. soil directed against Colombo.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said the U.S. State Department's coordinator for counter terrorism, Philip Wilcox, had expressed Washington's support for the government when he held talks with Sri Lankan officials in Colombo last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States government sympathised with the current predicament Sri Lanka was facing and would do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of American soil to perpetrate violence against the democratic government of Sri Lanka,&quot; Wilcox was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>U.S. diplomats confirmed Wilcox's remarks.</p>
<p>The U.S. military said earlier this month that it did not intend to get involved in the ethnic war. The Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Command said in a statement that a recent visit by a U.S. army team to train Sri Lankan soldiers was part of routine cooperation with the Sri Lankan army.</p>
<p>Western diplomats said the current lull in the ethnic war meant the army had exhausted itself after a thrust against the rebels' Kilinochchi stronghold in the north last month.</p>
<p>The army launched the assault soon after the LTTE overran the northeastern Mullaitivu army camp killing or capturing almost its entire garrison of 1,400 men.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not surprised to see a lull in activity by government forces,&quot; said a Western diplomat. &quot;The offensive was hastily planned.&quot;</p>
<p>Government forces have remained on the outskirts of Kilinochchi for the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Aid officials said more than 200,000 Tamils displaced by the offensive were still short of food and had no shelter.</p>
