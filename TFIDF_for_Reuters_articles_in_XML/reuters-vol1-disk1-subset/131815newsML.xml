<p>Russia's RAO Gazprom said on Monday a new Russian government policy initiative on energy and transport pricing would increase the company's cash flow.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the decree, the company will be able to pay excise and profit tax on the basis of proceeds realised from the sale (or settlement) of gas debts, provided that the proceeds are not less than the cost of production and transmission of the relevant gas delivered,&quot; Gazprom said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is expected to increase Gazprom's cash flow by enhancing its ability to collect its receivables,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>The decree, dated October 17, was on &quot;measures to limit the growth of prices for products of natural monopolies and to create conditions for the stabilisation of industry&quot;, the Gazprom statement said.</p>
<p>Gazprom said this provided a sound basis for the reduction of customer debt to the company.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom is currently owed approximately $9 billion by its Russian customers. The new decree requires the Russian government to establish a procedure to extinguish the debts of Russian customers to Gazprom (and other energy companies).</p>
<p>&quot;Until now the sale (or settlement) of customer debts at a discount has been unattractive for Gazprom since the company was required to pay exceise and profit tax on the full amount at which the gas was invoiced, even though debts were sold (or settled) at less than face value,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>A government statement on October 17 said the state had received only 74 percent of targeted taxes.</p>
<p>Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov said that the oil and gas sector owes the government 10 trillion roubles in back taxes.</p>
