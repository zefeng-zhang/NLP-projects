<p>OPPOSITION DENIES COALITION CLAIMS ON BY-ELECTION</p>
<p>The Federal Opposition has denied Coalition claims that the weekend Liberal by-election win in the Sydney seat of Lindsay was a vote for the partial sale of Telstra and Industrial Relations reforms.</p>
<p>Opposition leader, Kim Beazley, has told Radio National, that Government difficulties in getting the legislation through the upper house are the fault of the Coalition Senators.</p>
<p>Federal Government Senate leader, Robert Hill, says the Government can claim the Lindsay result as an endorsement of its mandate.</p>
<p>Senator Hill has urged the minor parties and Opposition to let the partial Telstra sale and industrial reforms get passed.</p>
<p>Australian Democrats Senate Whip, Vicki Bourne, says her Party also has a mandate, and it includes opposing the sale of Telstra.</p>

<p>HARRADINE REJECTS REAFFIRMING OF MANDATE</p>
<p>Tasmania's Independent Senator, Brian Harradine, says the Senate should not become a rubber stamp because of the Lindsay by-election result.</p>
<p>John Howard says the by-election result is a message to those opposed to the government's reforms to get out of the way.</p>
<p>But Senator Harradine has rejected the Prime Minister's claim the by-election reaffirms the Coalition's mandate.</p>
<p>And he says the outcome of the by-election won't influence his vote on the partial sale of Telstra.</p>
<p>He's pressuring the government to accept his preference shares proposal, saying he would be loathe to support the sale of a natural monopoly that could not be undone by a future government.</p>

<p>PASSIVE SMOKING SAID TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR CHILDREN</p>
<p>A new study has found that people who smoke at home are adversely affecting the health of their children.</p>
<p>An Australian Medical Association seminar in Canberra on passive smoking has heard that more than 17,000 children each year require treatment for bronchitis because their parents smoke.</p>
<p>Sydney University lecturer Jennifer Peat, says a further 50,000 children each year develop wheezing because they're passive smokers.</p>
<p>Dr Peat says the risk of infants being hospitalised for respiratory illness is double when compared to those living in a smoke free zone.</p>
<p>She says research shows that almost 30 per cent of children have a parent who smokes in the house.</p>

<p>PM CALLED ON TO STOP PRIVATE MEMBERS BILL</p>
<p>Northern Territory Attorney-General Denis Burke says the Prime Minister must now get involved in putting a stop to a Private Members bill to quash the Territory's voluntary euthanasia law.</p>
<p>A weekend Liberal Party conference passed a motion supporting the Territory's right to pass laws uninhibited by Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr Burke says he feels there's a growing mood within the Liberal Party that euthanasia should be debated separately, and not caught up in the issue of Territory rights.</p>

<p>MILITARY POLICE INVOVEMENT IN ARRESTS QUESTIONED</p>
<p>Questions are being raised over the arrests of more than 60 people at a Brisbane music festival on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The Australian Democrats want to know how military police became involved in the arrests at the 4ZZZ community radio station's market day at Musgrave Park.</p>
<p>Democrats Youth Affairs spokeswoman, Natasha Stott Despoja says both she and defence spokesman John Woodley are calling on the Queensland government to explain the police actions.</p>
<p>It's believed riot shields and batons were used on festival goers.</p>
<p>The Council for Civil Liberties wants the Criminal Justice Commission to look into the arrests.</p>
<p>The Council's Terry O'Gorman says the involvement of both State and military police appears to be a major exercise in overkill.</p>

<p>BLACKHAWK INQUIRY MOVES TO NORTH QUEENSLAND</p>
<p>The military Board of Inquiry into the deaths of 18 servicemen in a Blackhawk helicopter accident continues in Townsville today after three and a half weeks of hearing evidence in Perth.</p>
<p>The accident happened near Townsville during night training exercises on June the 12th.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has already heard evidence from 54 witnesses, including soldiers, aircrew, experts and investigators, and will move to Sydney after the Townsville hearings.</p>
<p>President of the Board of Inquiry, Brigadier Paul O'Sullivan is confident the Inquiry report will be completed by the end of December.</p>
<p>-- Reuters Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800  </p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look like it's going up. The likelihood is that it's going down,&quot; said Adrian Haylor, technical analyst at Sucden.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are near support so it might hold,&quot; Haylor added.</p>
<p>London futures tumbled last week from a high of $1,480 as players shrugged off bullish crop news and focused mainly on looming supplies from Central America.</p>
<p>The latest crop news emerged from El Salvador, where national coffee investigators said some five percent of the estimated coffee crop would be lost because of prolonged rains this year.</p>
<p>Earlier last week, Costa Rica said its crop would suffer large losses after torrential rains from Hurricane Lili.</p>
<p>But brokers dismissed such bullish scenarios.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds to us as if the producers in El Salvador and Costa Rica are trying to talk the price up by whatever means,&quot; said brokers GNI in their daily commentary.</p>
<p>&quot;More likely the coffee harvest will be hampered due to the loss of infrastructure washed away by the rains -- particularly in Nicaragua,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Tanzania, meanwhile, has announced plans to double coffee production to an estimated 100,000 tonnes by 2000.</p>
<p>Sucden's Haylor pegged support basis January at $1,380 and $1,350. Moving averages were bearish while the RSI was still not oversold and there was room for further losses.</p>
<p>Resistance was seen at $1,415 and $1,450.</p>
