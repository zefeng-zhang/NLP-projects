<p>Foreign investors and analysts said on Wednesday they were worried that Lithuania's currency, the litas, may be devalued by an incoming right-wing government, possibly reversing the country's positive inflation record.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union party of Vytautas Landsbergis on Sunday won the first round of parliamentary elections and said it would aim at unpegging the litas currency from the dollar.</p>
<p>Prime minister-designate Gediminas Vagnorius has insisted this does not mean devaluation as the central bank would run a strict monetary policy but Western investors are sceptical.</p>
<p>Vagnorius wants to dismantle the currency board system which keeps the litas pegged at four to one dollar and replace it with an inflation-adjusted system.</p>
<p>&quot;We have major concerns about the dismantling of the currency board,&quot; said one London-based analyst for a major portfolio investor in the Lithuanian market.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is done quickly, it will reverse the significant gains that have been made on the inflation front and will be an obstacle to foreign investment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The currency board, which also operates in Argentina, Hong Kong and Estonia, means the amount of litas in circulation must be exactly matched by the central bank's hard currency reserves.</p>
<p>But it also deprives the bank of the usual tools of monetary management, such as market interventions and interest rates.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union insists devaluation is not on the cards even if the peg is abandoned but investors are sceptical as the party has also often said the litas is overvalued and was hitting exports.</p>
<p>&quot;Devaluation will not be good for equity investment,&quot; said Lino Lourenco, analyst at Daiwa Research in London. &quot;Equity investors want a stable exchange rate.&quot;</p>
<p>But Lourenco said a floating exchange rate was not necessarily bad.</p>
<p>&quot;If it (dismantling the currency board) is done slowly and properly, the results may not be bad, provided the central bank sticks to a strong monetary policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on the central bank,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The currency board, begun with help from the IMF in 1994 to give the litas credibility, has been credited with cutting inflation and helping restabilise the economy.</p>
<p>Lithuania, like its Baltic neighbours Latvia and Estonia, set out on the road of economic reform soon after quitting the former Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>But it gained the reputation as something of a laggard, especially in terms of privatisation.</p>
<p>The government of former Communists, the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP), hardly started the sale of large industrial companies.</p>
<p>They never got close to announcing the privatisation of firms likely to tempt Western investors such as the airline and telecommunications company.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to Estonia, dubbed the region's star performer, where all the major state-owned firms have either been sold or are in the process of being sold.</p>
<p>However, inflation has fallen and the economy is growing although it was hit by a banking crisis late last year.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product this year is forecast to rise just one percent but accelerate to three to four percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Inflation, running at a year-on-year 1,200 percent after independence, was at 22.3 percent year-on-year in September.</p>
