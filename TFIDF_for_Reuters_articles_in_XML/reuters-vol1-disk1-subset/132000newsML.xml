<p>China's imports of fuel oil could fall sharply in November as buyers face some of the highest prices in five years.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports may be reduced to a minimum of 200,000 tonnes, lower than our usual imports of around 400,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes if fuel oil prices continue to increase,&quot; said a trader at China's state trading firm, SINOCHEM.</p>
<p>The price for Singapore benchmark 180-centistoke high sulphur fuel oil surged to a five-year high of $123.50 per tonne on October 10 and currently stands around $122.</p>
<p>Fuel oil prices have risen on the back of rallying crude oil prices, which also stand around five-year highs. Fuel oil is used in power generation, industry and shipping.</p>
<p>Chinese fuel oil buyers said they have started to import cargoes for November delivery, but were adopting a cautious stance while prices were so high.</p>
<p>October's fuel oil imports of 350,000 tonnes were also below the average of 400,000 tonnes, Chinese trading sources in Hong Kong said.</p>
<p>They said imports have been dwindling since August, when prices in the Singapore spot market started to rise.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of decreased imports, domestic inventories were gradually being depleted as buyers cut back on their purchase,&quot; said a trader at SINOCHEM.</p>
<p>&quot;Current inventories are very low,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the low stock levels were not expected to lead to a buying spree as buyers look to replenish the inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;If prices continue to rise, we may cut back on our imports further despite the low stocks and may turn to using coal or other alternatives for power generation,&quot; said a Chinese trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Utilities are reeling under the strong fuel oil prices,&quot; he said. &quot;While import costs are rising, utility rates (to customers) remain unchanged.&quot;</p>
<p>Chinese buyers said they would be willing to buy fuel oil cargoes at a delivered price to southern China for November of $124-$126 per tonne, $2-$3 lower than current offers.</p>
<p>They said current domestic prices for fuel oil in China, at 1,300 to 1,350 yuan per tonne ($157-$163), were not high enough to allow Chinese buyers to buy at current international spot market levels.</p>
<p>&quot;But if prices fall below $117 per tonne, there may be a surge in imports as buyers cash in to fill up their tanks,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said including import costs of around $36 per tonne, imported fuel oil currently costs around $161 per tonne, making it difficult for importers to make any profit.</p>
<p>China's state refiner, SINOPEC, said refiners have started to boost fuel oil output to meet domestic demand, particularly as the international price rally is showing little sign of relenting ahead of the northern winter.</p>
<p>The SINOPEC source said while China has raised its domestic gas oil price in line with higher international spot market quotes, it was still considering a rise in fuel oil prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Such adjustment would be inflationary,&quot; he said.</p>
