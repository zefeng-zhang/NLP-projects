<p>Egypt's bourse was recovering from a new dealing and clearing system on Tuesday with share prices rising in trade focused on milling shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>The systems halted trading last week, sending share prices tumbling to their lowest level since August 19 by Thursday. Brokers said activity was still quite slow because of problems, but they were being solved.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority's (CMA) overall share index gained 0.2 points to close at 233.5 points and turnover rose to an average 24.46 million pounds ($7.2 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Volume was relatively low as a reaction to settlement problems,&quot; said Mohammed Abdullah, broker with EFG/Hermes brokerage, adding that he expected settlement problems to be solved to coincide with the November economic conference.</p>
<p>This &quot;will cause a boom in the market in November.&quot;</p>
<p>He said in the cement sector, Egyptian Tora Portland Cement contributed most of the day's volume. &quot;It was one large transaction&quot;. The share ended unchanged at 61.</p>
<p>Misr International Bank/MIBANK was the most active share. It ended down five pounds at 370.</p>
<p>Milling shares were among the top gainers.</p>
<p>Central and West Delta Flour Mills shares rose 0.65 to 51.9 pounds. East Delta Flour Mills rose 0.56 to 36.36 while Central Egypt Flour Mills was unchanged at 27.00 pounds.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms fell to 352.47 points from 353.09 and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms gained 0.39 points to 163.86.</p>
<p>Prices of 15 stocks rose, 14 fell and 32 ended unchanged.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.40 pounds</p>
