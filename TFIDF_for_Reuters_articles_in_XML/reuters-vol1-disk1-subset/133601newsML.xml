<p>Shares in Jordan's largest bank, Arab Bank, rose strongly on Tuesday propping up an otherwise depressed Amman stock exchange, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the stock rose four dinars to 248 dinars on renewed hopes the bank would benefit from expected amendments to Jordan's company law, due to be discussed in the parliamentary session which opens next month.</p>
<p>Arab Bank shone through the otherwise gloomy sentiment on the exchange, helping the Amman Financial Market 60-share index rise 0.49 percent to 148.22 points in low trade worth 439,000 dinars ($620,000).</p>
<p>Brokers say the bank is planning a bonus share issue, which under proposed amendments to company law would no longer be liable to a 15 percent tax.</p>
<p>But falling stocks outnumbered gainers by 18 to eight. Shares in 17 other companies were traded but closed unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;The general mood of the investors is not good. People don't want to jump in,&quot; said Samir Jaradat of Jordan Investment Finance Bank, citing continued uncertainty over Israeli-Palestinian talks as a dampening factor on the market.</p>
<p>Livestock and Poultry was once again the busiest share on the exchange, with turnover of 136,000 dinars. But the stock, in which a single investor has acquired a controlling stake in recent weeks, fell back 0.02 dinars to 0.68 dinars.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Investable Index of the 45 best performing shares on the exchange rose 0.09 percent to 80.76 points from 80.69 points on Monday, still 15.44 percent down from the same time last year.</p>
