<headline>Kin of detained China dissident appeal to Kinkel.</headline>

<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Monday the family of detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan had appealed for him to raise the case in his forthcoming meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing.</p>
<p>Kinkel, who arrived in China on Monday for a five-day visit, said he would raise human rights issues with Chinese authorities but stopped short of saying whether he would bring up the case of Wang, who faces the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was an appeal by Wang Dan's family,&quot; Kinkel told reporters. Wang's family could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;I will raise human rights issue with Chinese leaders but it is important not to talk about human rights issue in a confrontational way,&quot; Kinkel said.</p>
<p>Wang, student leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army in June that year with heavy loss of life, was expected to be put on trial soon behind closed doors, family members say.</p>
<p>Court officials have confirmed that Wang, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.</p>
