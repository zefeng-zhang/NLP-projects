<headline>Egyptian press resumes attacks on Israeli leaders.</headline>

<p>An Egyptian government newspaper resumed its campaign against Israeli leaders on Tuesday, saying some members in the Jewish state's government were behaving like criminal gang members.</p>
<p>The newspaper al-Akhbar said in a frontpage editorial the past week of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the West Bank town of Hebron showed Israel was trying to circumvent old peace agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;In spite of the arrogance and impudence of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu..., the real factor influencing his attitude is the game of one-upmanship he is playing with the extremists in his government, whose behaviour is no different from that of members of criminal gangs,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The editorial said Israeli intransigence and haggling had killed the hope that Israel and the Palestinians would agree on an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron.</p>
<p>PLO negotiators stormed out of talks with Israel on Monday night in protest at the attitude of Israeli delegates, which they described as that of &quot;occupiers toward the occupied&quot;.</p>
<p>Al-Akhbar said it expected Israel would do everything possible to thwart French attempts to move Middle East peace talks forward. &quot;It does not see this (French) role as compatible with its aggressive and expansionist tendencies and its desperate attempts to obstruct the peace process,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Israeli leaders have rejected French President Jacques Chirac's proposal that Europe act as joint sponsor of the peace process, alongside the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The only explanation for this (attempt to exclude Europe) is fear that Europe is inclined towards justice and truly desires to achieve peace in the Middle East,...which Israel sees as an enemy to its dreams and to its strategy based on aggression and expansion,&quot; it added.</p>
