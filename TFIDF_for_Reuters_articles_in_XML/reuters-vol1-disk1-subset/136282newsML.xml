<title>UK: LME aluminium sustains run-up, copper falters.</title>
<headline>LME aluminium sustains run-up, copper falters.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-23</dateline>

<p>The LME's two top contracts went their separate ways on Wednesday afternoon as aluminium extended morning gains while copper ceded half of its earlier run-up.</p>
<p>Three months aluminium carved out fresh highs over the $1,400 mark, touching a peak of $1,411, before closing $39 higher at $1,406.</p>
<p>Copper on the other hand struggled to edge back above the key $1,970 level after hitting $1,990 in the morning, ending the afternoon kerb $16 higher at $1,976.</p>
<p>Short-covering and fund and trade buying boosted both markets on Wednesday morning with most of the fund activity seen in aluminium, floor traders said.</p>
<p>Aluminium was able to absorb a patch of producer selling but copper lost its steam as miner selling and profit-taking pounded the highs, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, see more room for gains in both markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's potential for more short-covering in both copper and aluminium,&quot; said William Adams, analyst at broker Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>Trades say further LME stock draws are expected in aluminium while copper inventories have already slid by  more than 100,000 tonnes since the end of August.</p>
<p>There was, however, a slight weakening in copper's premium of cash metal over three months material, which edged down to $30 from $35 on Tuesday and $40 the day before.</p>
<p>Many of the other metals tried higher levels along with the two leaders in the morning, but like copper were unable to sustain them.</p>
<p>Nickel finished only $15 higher at $7,175 after peaking at $7,230, while lead closed the kerb $5 stronger at $735 after touching $741.</p>
<p>Tin ended $5 weaker at $5,985 and zinc lost 50 cents to $1,024.50.</p>
<p>Alloy closed firmer at $1,270, up $25.</p>
