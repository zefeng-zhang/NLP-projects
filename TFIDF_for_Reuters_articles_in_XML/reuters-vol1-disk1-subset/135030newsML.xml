<headline>UK's Rebus to buy insurance software firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rebus Group Plc said on Tuesday it conditionally agreed to buy  EPG, a supplier of application software for the insurance industry, for an initial total of 11.75 million stg.</p>
<p>Rebus also said it expected to take an exceptional charge of about 270,000 stg in the second half of the year related to the recent establishment of the company's new head office.</p>
<p>The management software supplier said the terms could be adjusted depending on whether EPG's pretax profits for the year ending October 31 were greater or less than 1.1 million stg.  </p>
<p>The maximum upward adjustment would be 200,000 stg, Rebus said in a statement.</p>
<p>Rebus said the effect of the acquisition on its short-term earnings per share would be &quot;broadly neutral&quot;, although the company's prospects would be enhanced in the medium term.</p>
<p>The company said some limited cost savings would result from the integration of data centre facilies.</p>
<p>The company said it would fund the deal by issuing about 18.1 million new ordinary shares, which were conditionally placed at 65p per share to raise 11.75 million stg.</p>
<p>Of this initial consideration, 2.75 million stg will be retained for two years after completion of the acquisition in a warranty escrow account.</p>
<p>This amount will be held to satisfy any payment obligations of vendors to the company and to secure the continuing employment of key EPG management.</p>
<p>The company also said it planned to raise about 1.0 million stg more, before expenses, by the issue of an additional 1.6 million new ordinary shares placed at 65p per share.</p>
<p>UBS will act as agent for the placement, Rebus said.</p>
