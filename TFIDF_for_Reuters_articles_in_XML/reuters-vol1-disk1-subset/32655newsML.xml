<p>U.S. Treasuries ended lower on Wednesday and the 30-year long bond lost 1/2 point on strong August automotive sales that pointed to healthy third-quarter growth, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Strong sales reported by General Motors and major Japanese transplants kept alive market fears the Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rate later this month.</p>
<p>One relief on the inflation front was a pullback in oil prices on news President Saddam Hussein's troops are withdrawing from the Kurd-populated regions of northern Iraq.  </p>
<p>&quot;The car sales weighed on us into the close,&quot; said economist James Padinha at MMS International.</p>
<p>Chrysler reported weaker-than-expected August sales on Tuesday. Ford said it will release its numbers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Based on the figures already available, MMS International projected total domestic automotive sales at an annual rate of 14.1 million units in August, above forecasts.</p>
<p>If the projection is accurate, U.S. car sales would come in for January-August at about the same 15-million-unit rate as in 1994 -- the best year of the current expansion and the strongest year for car sales since 1988.  </p>
<p>Amid uncertainty about the U.S. interest rate outlook, the 6-3/4 percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond ended down 16/32 at 95-21/32 to yield 7.10 percent. Meanwhile, the 2-year note/30-year bond yield curve continued to flatten to 74 basis points from 75 points on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like a strong retail month with the Schroders chain store sales,&quot; said Padinha, referring to the research firm BTM/Schroders' survey showing retail sales up 1.3 percent in the week ended August 31.</p>
<p>The report, which showed chain stores sales up 6.8 percent year-over-year, pressured the Treasury market at the opening.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market never recovered from that store sales report,&quot; said Padinha.</p>
<p>The MMS economsit pointed out such numbers only added fuel to market fears U.S. economic growth will slow in the third quarter from its torrid 4.8-percent pace in April-June -- but not enough to remove the potential for inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, the economy slowed down from the second quarter. But the degree of the slowdown, whether we'll slow enough, that's the real issue, and the market is definitely worried about that,&quot; Padinha remarked, while warning &quot;We could see a carnage on Friday.&quot;  </p>
<p>Friday's session is likely to be the most important one of the month with the release of the August employment report at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey puts payrolls at up 244,000 vs. up 193,000 in July, the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent vs. 5.4 percent, and average hourly earnings at up 0.3 percent vs down 0.2 percent in July.</p>
<p>A jump in payroll creation or -- possibly worse -- a large rise in hourly earnings may propel the 30-year bond yield to new highs for the year -- above the 7.25-percent barrier tested on previous strong employment reports.  </p>
<p>Traders said clear-cut signs of rising wages could trigger a bloodshed by reinforcing the view the Fed must then raise rates by an aggressive 50 basis points at its September 24 meeting to catch up with inflation.</p>
<p>The three-month Treasury bill closed unchanged at a 5.18-percent discount rate, the six-month bill was up one at 5.36 and the one-year bill up three at 5.59 percent.</p>
<p>The two-year note closed down 3/32 at 99-18/32 and 6.36 percent, the five-year note down 6/32 at 99-1/32 and 6.73 percent, and the 10-year note down 10/32 at 100-15/32 and 6.93 percent.</p>
