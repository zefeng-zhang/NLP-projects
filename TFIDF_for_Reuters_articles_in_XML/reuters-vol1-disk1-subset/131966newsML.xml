<headline>OPINION - Ivan Wong comments on Malaysian palm oil.</headline>
<text>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 21 - PORLA reported CPO production rose six percent of 49,300 tonnes to 864,700 tonnes in September. This is 27,000 tonnes more than the figure estimated by PALMIS and MOPGC. As expected, production in Peninsular Malaysia rose a mere one percent or 6,500 tonnes to 646,400 tonnes. In comparision, production in East Malaysia remained robust. It rose 24.4 percent or 42,800 tonnes to 218,300 tonnes. In August the month-on-month increase was 37.3 percent (revised from 34.7 percent).  </p>
<p>The excellent output in East Malaysia was contributed by record yields - estimated at not less than 2.16 tons of FFB per harvested hectare in Sabah - as well as better than expected OER. The effective operating milling capacity in Sabah also surpassed our estimate. For the first nine months this year, CPO production in the country expanded eight percent or 453,700 tonnes to 6.10 million tonnes. For the 12 months to September, production grew 6.3 percent to 8.264 million tonnes. For this month, our tentative estimate shows production declining around three percent to 840,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>The seasonal downtrend will accelerate in November. The rainy season has started but had so far this month not hampered harvesting operations in any way. Official figure on end September stocks of palm oil, at 894,000 tonnes, was within our estimate of 900,000 tonnes. Stocks of CPO rose 50,200 tonnes to 524,500 tonnes with East Malaysia alone registering an increase of 53,900 tonnes to 168,200 tonnes. In line with a record high apparent domestic CPO utilisition of 808,000 tonnes, stocks of PPO also increased to 369,500 tonnes from 328,700 tonnes at end August.  </p>
<p>Latest export figures released by PORLA showed an unusually large upward revision in palm oil exports in August to 687,870 tonnes from 638,601 tonnes reported last month. This was not totally unexpected as we had stuck to a higher estimate of 678,000 tonnes. PORLA's preliminary palm oil exports of 637,079 tonnes in September, a drop of 50,800 tonnes from August, are also likely to be underestimated. The final figure could be closer to 680,000 tonnes or just about 10,000 tonnes less than August.  </p>
<p>Palm oil exports this month may still remain at a healthy level of around 670,000 tonnes, inclusive of some 15,000 tonnes of CPO. Consequently, we estimate end October stocks of palm oil to rise to 965,000 tonnes. This compares with our September 23 projection of close to one million tonnes. However, weak market price for SBO well as concern over the increasing slack in new export business had resulted in CPO futures dropping 37-44 ringgit in the week ended October 18. December CPO futures settled at 1,114 ringgit while RBD OLN was quoted at $520.  </p>
