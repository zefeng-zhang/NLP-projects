<p>Ireland's CRH Plc said on Wednesday it was buying U.S. construction materials company Tilcon from British conglomerate BTR Plc for $329 million in the largest acquisition deal in its history.</p>
<p>Despite the size of the deal, CRH said its active acquisitions strategy would continue unabated.</p>
<p>The Irish-based building materials firm said it would dispose of some parts of Tilcon and the effective cost of the acquisition would be around $254 million.</p>
<p>&quot;At an effective net cost to us of $254 million we have exceptional value, superb quarries and a most amazing fit with our present operations with pretty unique synergies,&quot; CRH chief executive Don Godson told Reuters.</p>
<p>Tilcon, one of the largest construction materials groups in the northeastern United States, would combine with CRH's U.S. operations to create &quot;an unassailable position in the northeast,&quot; Godson said.</p>
<p>He said CRH's policy of actively seeking smaller bolt-on acquisitions would continue, helped by a share placing which will raise a net 101 million punts ($164 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Our acquisition policy has been the secret of our success, and we'll keep following it,&quot; Godson said.</p>
<p>He said that although CRH could have financed the Tilcon acquisition from its own debt facilities, the share placing allowed it to make future acquisitions. &quot;We didn't want to forego other opportunities that we see in Europe, in developing regions and indeed in the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>Godson said there would be no need for a rights issue in the forseeable future. Market talk of a possible rights issue held the share price back in recent weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>BTR sold Tilcon as part of a major strategic overhaul involving the sale of non-core businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a situation where we had quite a motivated seller working to a different agenda, and we were a dispassionate and patient negotiator,&quot; Godson said. &quot;We got excellent value.&quot;</p>
<p>CRH announced the acquisition at the same time as reporting its half-year results. Pre-tax profits were 64.1 million punts ($103.6 million) in the first six months of 1996, 13 percent up on the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;Increases in underlying profits in Ireland and the U.S. together with contributions from recent acquisitions were partly offset by declines in the UK and mainland Europe,&quot; Godson said.</p>
<p>He said the outlook for the rest of the year was generally positive, with Ireland and North America continuing to perform strongly.</p>
<p>By 1150 GMT CRH shares had edged a penny higher to 603 Irish pence in Dublin. In London, BTR shares were four pence higher at 259.5, althogh analysts said profit fears and strategic concerns continued to dampen sentiment about the British company.</p>
