<p>A U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi radar in the expanded &quot;no-fly zone&quot; in southern Iraq on Wednesday after the radar began tracking the aircraft, an administration official said.  </p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, said the Iraqi radar went silent after the missile was fired, but it was not immediately clear whether it was destroyed.</p>
<p>The official said initial reports indicated the missile was fired after the radar actively &quot;painted&quot; the jet with its seeker signal in defiance of warnings to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces not to try to shoot down coalition aircraft policing the no-fly zone.</p>
<p>The United States expanded the southern no-fly zone in Iraq, which Western allies created after the 1991 Gulf War to help protect Iraq's Shiite Moslems from attack by Saddam, on Wednesday as part of U.S. retaliation for attacks on Iraqi Kurds. But the official said he did not know whether the radar incident occurred in the new area of the expanded zone.</p>
<p>&quot;The radar went down after the incident. That's all I know,&quot; the official told Reuters. Some U.S. aircraft flying in the region are equipped with &quot;Harm&quot; high-speed anti-radiation missiles designed to seek out radar signals and ride them to their source.</p>
