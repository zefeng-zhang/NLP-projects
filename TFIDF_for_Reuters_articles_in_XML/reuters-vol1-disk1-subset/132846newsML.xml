<title>ARGENTINA: MARADONA'S MANAGER TRIES TO OUST DRUGS CASE JUDGE.</title>
<headline>MARADONA'S MANAGER TRIES TO OUST DRUGS CASE JUDGE.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>The manager of Argentine soccer great Diego Maradona on Monday requested a judge investigating him for alleged drug-trafficking be declared incompetent on technical grounds, his attorney said.</p>
<p>Lawyer Mariano Cuneo Liberona said his client Guillermo Coppola requested Judge Hernan Bernasconi be replaced in the case because Coppola's apartment -- the scene of a raid last week -- was outside the judge's jurisdiction, the state-owned Telam news agency reported.</p>
<p>Coppola has been in custody since surrendering to police at the end of a day on the run after investigators said they found a pound (500 grams) of cocaine in a flower vase in a raid at his luxury Buenos Aires apartment.</p>
<p>Cuneo Liberona said Coppola repeated his plea of innocence on Monday and said again that any cocaine found was not his.</p>
<p>But state prosecutor Jorge Mola said, &quot;There is enough evidence to lay charges,&quot; according to Telam.</p>
<p>Coppola's permanent tan-and-white hair have appeared regularly in Argentine glossy magazines and social pages for years, as a leading member of an Argentine jet-set of sports stars, models, actors and politicians.</p>
<p>Some Maradona fans blame Coppola for their idol's drug habit, which earned him a 15-month suspension after a dope test in the U.S. World Cup. Maradona admitted a drug problem and went to a Swiss clinic last month, but a few days later he smashed up a Spanish hotel and was then accused of switching urine tests after a random post-match drug test.</p>
