<p>The head of Japan's giant Mitsubishi Corporation on Monday predicted a new era in economic relations between Australia and Japan through the formation of joint ventures to service the entire Asian market.</p>
<p>Shinroku Morohashi, chairman of Mitsubishi Corp, told a Japan-Australia Business Corporation meeting that under the new approach Japanese corporations might, for example, invest in the Australian food industry.</p>
<p>Investments might flow to areas such as dairy products manufacturing and meat processing.  </p>
<p>Australia would then export the products not only to Japan but to all the nations of Asia, he said, adding that a few Japanese companies had already initiated such efforts.</p>
<p>Another part of the new approach was likely to involve the development of cooperative business ventures between Australian and Japanese corporations in Asia.</p>
<p>Morohashi called on Australian business to utilise the expertise that Japan had developed in Asian markets, including through the establishment of joint business activities.  </p>
<p>Pacific Power of Australia and the Electric Power Development Co Ltd of Japan were already jointly providing consulting services and technological assistance for the planning of the Pha Lai thermal power plant in Vietnam, he said.</p>
<p>Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd and Itochu Corp of Japan were jointly working on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves and on the supply of gas in Pakistan, he said.</p>
<p>Morohashi also pointed out that there were major cost differentials between Japan and Australia.  </p>
<p>Land prices in Tokyo were about 22 times higher than in Sydney, while gasoline prices were 2.5 times higher in Tokyo than in Sydney, he said.</p>
