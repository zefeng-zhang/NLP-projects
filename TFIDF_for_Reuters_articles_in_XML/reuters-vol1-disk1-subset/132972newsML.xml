<headline>LIFFE white sugar easier but off lows in PM.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>White sugar futures were  easier but above their session's lows. Traders said business was routine with light premium buying against New York's March the only dominant feature.</p>
<p>The March/March premium saw deals at $79, said one.</p>
<p>The New York raws contracts were marginally higher on scale-down trade buying on March and May.</p>
<p>Apart from that, dealings were quiet in the absence of fresh news and lack of participation due to a week-long trade gathering in London.</p>
<p>The market generally brushed aside news that a hurricane has flattened or flooded large areas of Cuban sugar cane and the damage may affect the 1996/97 harvest.</p>
<p>&quot;The market prices don't seem to reflect the damage in Cuba. Obviously people think the situation is not quite like what they say,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it has caused particular damage to the sugar cane,&quot; said another. &quot;The only thing is it may make harvesting a bit difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Cuban state media said some 1.4 million acres of cane were affected in the western and central areas of the country.</p>
<p>By 1547 GMT, the most active March contract stood $1.40 lower at $312.70 after trading to a low of $312.40 during the session. The front-month December lost 90 cents at $316.50.</p>
<p>Turnover totalled 1,073 lots, with the Dec/March switch trading at $3.80.</p>
<p>No news emerged on Libya's recent buying tender for 14,000 tonnes of 45 ICUMSA white sugar after it postponed the deadline for bids to Monday.</p>
<p>Paris sugar also ticked lower on nearby contracts with March easing $1.30 to $312.80.</p>
