<title>JAPAN: INSTANT VIEW - Japan's August leading indicators.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - Japan's August leading indicators.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>The following is a selection of analysts' reactions to Japan's closely watched diffusion index of leading economic indicators for August released on Tuesday, which stood at 33.3 on a scale of 100.</p>
<p>Analysts had anticipated that the August leading index would be below the so-called &quot;boom or bust&quot; 50 mark for the first time in five months. A figure for the index below 50 suggests the economy will contract in the coming months.</p>
<p>YUICHI MATSUSHITA, NIKKO RESEARCH CENTER:</p>
<p>&quot;That's is in line with my expectations and that's not a surprise.&quot;  </p>
<p>   &quot;We have no big confidence in the underlying (economic) conditions. The leading indicators suggest we have little confidence in the economy overall... The government and the BOJ have to think about something new to stimulate the economy overall.</p>
<p>    &quot;I heard that the BOJ governor's statement (yesterday) was very conservative and that the tone was pretty much the same as the previous one. The message is that they (the BOJ) asked the government to take steps to stimulate the economy. I hope that message from (BOJ governor Yasuo) Matsushita would be responded to by (Prime Minister Ryutaro) Hashimoto.&quot;</p>
<p>  The main reason for the drop in the leading indicators to below the 50 point boom-or-bust level was weaker output figures from the manufacturing sector reflected in the industrial production data, he said. However, looking at non-manufacturers and smaller firms, &quot;I don't think the Japanese economy is as weak as this indicator suggests.</p>
<p>    &quot;I believe the economy will restart its gradual recovery in the October-December quarter.&quot;  &quot;I'm afraid that given the fiscal state at the moment, it is unlikely that we will get a large boost for the economy from the public sector.&quot;</p>
<p>    &quot;But none the less, the Japanese economy is now going through a crucial transitional period of public-led recovery to a private-led and sustainable state of recovery. For me, there is little risk that this private-led recovery is going to fail, so I think we will get a moderate but sustainable recovery.&quot; (c) Reuters Limited 1996</p>
