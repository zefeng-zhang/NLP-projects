<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures shed a large part of their recent gains, ending sharply lower on Monday as players took profit after the Japanese general election.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) failure to emerge with a majority caused players to cash in positions built up in anticipation of such a result.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some position adjustment because the LDP didn't get a clear win,&quot; said a trader with a local institution. &quot;They will need to form some alliances to get the government going and we don't know what's going to happen.&quot;  </p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 December contract tumbled from 21,705 at the open to close at 21,245. Its previous settlement was at 21,715.</p>
<p>&quot;It broke through intermediate support at 21,460 today and that's bad,&quot; said the trader, adding that the market's close below the 21,275 level also sent a bearish signal.</p>
<p>He said the December Nikkei would be supported at 21,155 and a close above 21,275 would allow it to consolidate before heading higher.</p>
<p>A Japanese bank dealer said the Dow's move could have some influence on the Nikkei's direction on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;This was purely profit-taking,&quot; he said, adding that the December Nikkei could head down to 20,800 if it failed to hold above 21,000.</p>
