<p>A Jewish candidate for Austria's far-right Freedom Party on Wednesday defended his cooperation with the nationalist group in a European election campaign as a symbol of post-Nazi era rapprochement.</p>
<p>Peter Sichrovsky, a journalist and author whose parents fled to Britain from Austria before World War Two, said his ties with Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider were a sign of renewed ties in the post-war generation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the symbolic cooperation of two Austrians from very different families,&quot; Sichrovsky told the daily Salzburger Nachrichten. &quot;It's a symbol because our fathers would probably not have been on the same side.&quot;</p>
<p>After emigrating to Britain, Sichrovsky's father Harry joined the British army and was part of a unit which helped liberate Vienna from the Nazis.</p>
<p>According to the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance in Vienna, Haider's father Robert was a member of the National Socialist party and fought in Adolf Hitler's army.</p>
<p>But Sichrovsky said the Freedom Party was in no way a Nazi organisation, shrugging off accusations by political rivals that it is extremist and racist.</p>
<p>&quot;The history of National Socialism does not continue in the form of the Freedom Party,&quot; he told Wednesday's Kurier daily.</p>
<p>&quot;I see Haider as a conservative politician who questions the system Austria erected in the post-war years and strives for change and improvement,&quot; he said in the Standard newspaper.</p>
<p>But asked this week if he would join the Freedom Party, Sichrovsky said: &quot;For heaven's sake, no.&quot; Sichrovsky, who labels himself a liberal, has no political affiliations and will stand as an independent on the Freedom Party ticket.</p>
<p>Haider on Monday nominated Sichrovsky as his party's number two candidate for European parliament elections on October 13, when Austrians elect their representatives to the assembly.</p>
<p>The far right won nearly a quarter of votes in last December's general election and is expected to secure five of Austria's 21 seats in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Asked how a Jew could agree to run for the controversial Freedom Party, Sichrovsky said religion was not an issue.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had turned down the offer to be a candidate for the Freedom Party, people would have said: &quot;Of course, how could a Jew be a candidate there.' By saying yes, people say: &quot;Haider only chose him because he's a Jew.' That's a sick line of argument.&quot;</p>
<p>Sichrovsky, who turns 50 on Thursday, has in the past been a fierce critic of the Freedom Party leader.</p>
<p>After Haider in 1991 praised Hitler's employment policies, the journalist said he was like &quot;the scum that floats to the top, even when you add fresh water&quot;.</p>
<p>But Sichrovsky, who spent most of his life in Austria but now works in Chicago, told Die Presse that Haider had changed and should not be judged by individual comments. Still, he said he would not excuse such &quot;slips of the tongue&quot;.</p>
