<title>DENMARK: Danish Industry Ministry drops shipbuilding probe.</title>
<headline>Danish Industry Ministry drops shipbuilding probe.</headline>

<p>Denmark's industry minister Mimi Jacobsen presented on Wednesday a new ministry report concluding that her ministry's administration of shipbuilding aid in the period 1986-95 was in accordance with European Union rules.</p>
<p>&quot;The report show that EU's aid ceilings have not been exceeded,&quot; Jacobsen said at a news conference.</p>
<p>At the same time Jacobsen said she was dropping a planned legal probe into state shipbuilding aid, rejecting the findings of a critical independent study accusing the government of illegalities.</p>
<p>Jacobsen said her ministry had studied 308 cases of aid granted to Danish shipbuilding yards in the period 1986-1995 and found that the report's critical stance was unfounded and full of errors and misinterpretations of European Union rules.</p>
<p>The study, commissioned by the ministry and carried out by international accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, criticised changing Danish governments for subsidising the sector to the tune of four billion crowns ($697 million) between 1986-1995.</p>
<p>Based on a random sample of 58 cases, it accused the governments of illegalities, irregularities and granting aid to yards in breach of international rules.</p>
<p>Jacobsen said 10 borderline cases of state loans being granted for Norwegian and Swedish shipping companies to build vessels at six minor Danish yards in 1986-87 were erroneously not referred to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development but that this had been discussed with the Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;We have checked Cooper &amp; Lybrand's survey in depth, now our report will be forwarded to the European Commission,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Cooper &amp; Lybrand study was roundly attacked by the Danish Shipbuilders Association and A.P. Moeller, Denmark's leading shipping, oil and gas group, when it came out in May this year.</p>
<p>In July the European Commission announced plans to investigate Danish shipbuilding aid after seeing the study, fearing that Denmark's ship subsidies might have exceeded EU limits in the period.</p>
<p>The Commission said in a statement then that judging from the Cooper &amp; Lybrand study, there were indications that vessels were financed during the period on the basis of an inflated price level &quot;which has created a risk that the state aid ceiling was exceeded.&quot;</p>
<p>Denmark, its shipbuilding industry in crisis, is a major opponent of state subsidising and Danish shipbuilders, backed by the government, have filed a suit in the European Court of Justice against the Commission over shipbuilding subsidies to east German yards.</p>
