<p>Demand at the auction of 2.0 billion stg of five-year gilts on Tuesday surpassed even the most optimistic expectations and sets the stage for a successful sale of longer-dated paper on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was more bullish than most and it was even a little stronger than I had expected,&quot; said Steve Scott, gilts analyst at Kleinwort Benson. &quot;It sets the market up well for the longer auction on Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuesday's auction of 2.0 billion stg of 7.0 percent gilts due 2001 was covered 3.57 times.  </p>
<p>The Bank of England will auction 1.5 billion stg of 8.0 percent stock due 2015 on Thursday in the second leg of its dual auction.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was unlikely the Bank will tap the longer end of the curve for some time after this week, lending further support to the auction.</p>
<p>The yield tale at Tuesday's auction was zero basis points and there was no price tail.</p>
<p>Analysts said the sale was helped by the fact the short end of the gilt curve was relatively cheap at present.  </p>
<p>&quot;The auction was very encouraging and should help the second leg go better,&quot; said Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Plc. &quot;But having said that, we have had a near 25 basis point increase in yields at the short end so it was relatively cheap.&quot;</p>
<p>Kleinwort Benson's Scott said the modest size of the auction, the fact it was short-dated paper and the cheaper levels all helped the sale. &quot;The market got ahead of it and so provided an opportunity to buy at good yield levels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the healthy demand for the paper would give the gilt market a psychological boost ahead of September retail sales data due on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Economists expect British retail sales eased 0.1 percent in September from August but are confident the trend in consumer spending is still firmly upwards.</p>
<p>Tuesday's auction success mirrors that of the Bank's ground-breaking dual auction in July. Then, 2.0 billion stg of 8.0 percent gitls due 2000 were covered 4.81 times, also with no yield tale.</p>
<p>The second part of the sale, 1.5 billion stg of the same longer dated stock that is on offer on Thursday, was also well received, attracting cover of 1.88 times.  </p>
<p>UK gilts rose slightly on the auction result with the December gilt future rising to 109-24 from 109-22 before. The positive sentiment was further buoyed by the latest CBI survey which showed inflationary pressures remained subdued.</p>
<p>The December gilt stood at 109-26 during lunchtime trade, up 14/32 on the day.</p>
