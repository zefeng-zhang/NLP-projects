<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said its worldwide pharmaceutical products sales rose 11 percent in the third quarter, despite a sharp drop in U.S. sales of its Capoten heart drug following expiration of its patent.</p>
<p>A key driver in the company's pharmaceutical sales was its cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, which jumped 35 percent in the quarter to $261 million, the company said.</p>
<p>U.S. Capoten sales dropped 72 percent in the quarter, due to the loss of its U.S. patent in February 1996 and the onset of competition from cut-priced generics, Bristol-Myers said. It did not provide a dollar figure for Capoten sales.  </p>
<p>The company reported third quarter earnings of $1.50 a share, up from $1.36 a year ago and topping the First Call consensus estimate of $1.48 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased to report that, despite the continuing negative impact of the Capoten patent expiration, the company experienced solid sales and earnings growth during the third quarter,&quot; said Charles Heimbold, Bristol-Myers chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Sales of the anti-cancer drug Taxol rose 34 percent to $206 million in the quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>Consumer product sales rose 12 percent in the quarter, driven by haircoloring and hair care products including Nice n Easy and Natural Instincts.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers said its nutritional product sales grew 10 percent in the third quarter, while its medical device product sales remained flat compared to prior year levels.</p>
