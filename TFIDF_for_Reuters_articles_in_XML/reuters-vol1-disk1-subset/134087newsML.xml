<p>Germany supports Italy's efforts to join the single European currency but a decision on which nations will be founding members will be determined by objective criteria, a government spokeswoman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman declined to comment on remarks by Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who told the Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper that Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants Italy in the first wave of countries joining the EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;Those nations that fulfil the objective criteria will take part,&quot; she said. &quot;We have not changed our position that the criteria have to be fulfilled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The government has always recognised Italy's efforts to save and consolidate its budgets,&quot; she said, adding that the decision as to which countries take part in the 1999 launch will not be a political decision.</p>
<p>Prodi, who met Kohl in Bonn last week, told the newspaper that even if some sectors of German public opinion wanted to keep Italy out the German leader did not support them.</p>
<p>&quot;Kohl is convinced that an Italy inside Europe creates far fewer political and economic problems than an Italy kept out,&quot; Prodi told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Prodi had told journalists in Bonn last Thursday that Kohl had no objections to Italy joining the exchange rate mechanism and then the single currency.</p>
<p>But on Monday in Potsdam, Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher said that Italy should not take part in currency union from the beginning because it failed to meet the fiscal requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italians want to get in, but they shouldn't get in,&quot; Kuehbacher, also president of the Berlin-Brandenburg state central bank, said.</p>
