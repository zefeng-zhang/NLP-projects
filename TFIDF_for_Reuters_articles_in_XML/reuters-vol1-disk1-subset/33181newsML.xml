<p>The vast majority of Germans arrested for neo-Nazi violence are under 20 years old, a federal watchdog agency said on Wednesday when it opened a new exhibition warning youths to keep away from the far right.</p>
<p>The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) said 78 percent of arrested neo-Nazis were in their teens and most of the broader far-right violence that has plagued Germany since its 1990 unification was caused by those under 21.</p>
<p>&quot;Extremist right-wing arguments are easily spread among young people seeking direction,&quot; said Gerhard Boekel, environment minister for the state of Hesse, in opening the exhibition called &quot;Democracy is Vulnerable&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Developing political awareness is one of the best ways of combating the problem,&quot; he added in a speech opening the exhibition at the Hesse Ministry for Science and Art in this western German city. The exhibition runs through September 26.</p>
<p>BfV President Peter Frisch said that as a child he had experienced the old form of national socialism.</p>
<p>&quot;Directly because of that it is important that we make every effort to deny right-wing extremism in Germany any chance of success,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BfV said there are around 6,000 violent right-wing extremists operating in Germany. Around 2,500 of these were neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>The most striking display at the exhibition was of weapons seized from neo-Nazi groups over the last few years. They included a machinegun, pistols, bayonets, martial arts weapons, baseball bats and switchblades.</p>
<p>The agency warned that in attempting to raise awareness for their own cause, right-wing extremists have been quick to use new technology. The exhibition shows how neo-Nazis have their own internet sites offering contacts to far-right groups.</p>
<p>Alexander Puest, an 18-year-old student from Wiesbaden, said: &quot;It's very interesting. They could maybe have showed more of the victims to show the results of these actions.&quot;</p>
<p>The exhibition also includes a map which shows the number of attacks and the number of fatalities in the individual states between 1991 and 1995.</p>
<p>The greatest number of attacks were in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with 2,153, followed by Lower Saxony, also in the west with 891, and then the eastern state of Brandenburg, with 739.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought the map was useful, it shows that this isn't just happening in east Germany, which we are often told is the case,&quot; said Puest.</p>
<p>The production and distribution of neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany, and much of the propaganda comes from abroad, the agency said.</p>
<p>Much extreme right-wing propaganda is published in Lincoln, Nebraska in the United States, where a group called the NSDAP-AO -- or &quot;Nazi foreign development agency&quot; -- produces racist and inflammatory material for German neo-Nazi groups.</p>
<p>Other exhibits include a selection of songs by skinhead bands like Glatzenparty (Skinhead party), Close Shave and Volkszorn (People's Rage).</p>
<p>The songs contain racist lyrics along the lines of &quot;We really hate bloody foreigners&quot;, or violent neo-Nazi sentiments such as: &quot;We are skinheads, the brownshirts of today, we are skinheads, always ready to fight.&quot;</p>
<p>The number of violent attacks by right-wing extremists has been on the downturn in recent years, from a peak of 2,639 attacks in 1992 to 837 in 1995.</p>
