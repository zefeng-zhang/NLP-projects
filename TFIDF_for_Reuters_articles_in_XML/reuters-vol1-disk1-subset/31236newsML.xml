<p>Russian consumer prices fell in August for the first time since economic reforms began in 1992 but economists said the good news masked problems ahead for firms, banks and individuals.</p>
<p>They said that tight monetary policy had dragged inflation down but low tax payments, high inter-enterprise debt and mounting wage arrears were bad signs for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government can manage not to spend what it promised to spend, then we could have 20 percent (year-on-year) inflation this year but it's not the low-inflation, high-growth economy that you are looking for,&quot; said one Western investment analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a sign of ill-health rather than of potential good health.&quot;</p>
<p>The state statistics committee said consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in August after a rise of 0.7 percent in July.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation data for August is not yet available but the committee said consumer prices had risen 16.1 percent since the start of the year.</p>
<p>If the current negative price trend continued, annual inflation could be as low as 15 percent, it said. Consumer prices rose 131 percent year-on-year in December 1995.</p>
<p>Economists said seasonal factors -- low food prices and holiday absences -- were also behind the August price fall.</p>
<p>But some said the low rate could hurt fragile Russian banks, which need high inflation and high interest rates to stay afloat.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody expects that inflation will not be as low as in August in coming months but it will nevertheless be low, and that could lead to a banking crisis in Russia in the fall,&quot; said Sergei Markov, analyst with the Carnegie Institute.</p>
<p>Discontent with reforms is growing and millions of workers have not been paid for months.</p>
<p>Companies blame other firms which do not pay for deliveries but weak bankruptcy laws and an inefficient legal system mean there is little they can do to make people pay.</p>
<p>The battle against inflation has been one of Russia's toughest fights since it launched its economic reforms in January 1992. The August figure will be welcome news to a government under pressure on other fronts.</p>
<p>Tax collection is running well behind schedule and the government will face a struggle to get its tight 1997 budget through a parliament dominated by communists and other conservatives.</p>
<p>The budget envisages a deficit of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), after a forecast 3.85 percent gap this year.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund postponed handing over the July tranche of a three-year $10 billion loan to Russia because of concern about Moscow's ability to meet the 1996 budget.</p>
<p>But the money was handed over last month and the IMF is expected to approve the August tranche of the loan soon.</p>
<p>Officials working with the Russian finance ministry say the IMF also revised up its target for the Russian budget deficit to 5.25 percent of GDP from four percent.</p>
<p>Russia and the IMF use different methodology to calculate the budget deficit.</p>
