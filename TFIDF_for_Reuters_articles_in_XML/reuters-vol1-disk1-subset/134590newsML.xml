<p>Gold prices marched higher on Tuesday, building on gains posted the previous day, while the other metals followed its lead, dealers said. Amid bullish market sentiment, bullion fixed at $383.35 an ounce, the highest fixing in five weeks. It had fixed at $382.40 in the morning and $381.00 on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Dealers attributed gold's gains to market players covering short positions after prices tenaciously held above the key $380 level during downside tests over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're beginning to see is the traditional end-of-month shortcovering before the expiration of options,&quot; a dealer said. Options give the right but not the obligation to buy or sell metal at a given price.</p>
<p>But market opinion was mixed as to whether the rally indicated a recovery from its downtrend or a temporary blip higher before resuming its slide.</p>
<p>Gold drifted to 18-month lows earlier this month, undermined by indifference from investors and speculators and weaker than expected demand from the jewellery industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not convinced. I think we're just in a new $381-$383 range. The producer selling that was around last week to depress prices is still around,&quot; the dealer said. Strong resistance was expected at around $384 an ounce.</p>
<p>Still, a series of uptrending technical indicators on historical price charts suggested a forthcoming upswing, some technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sudden bursts of strength enjoyed by gold, platinum and silver yesterday much reduces downside risk,&quot; analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed there is a possibility the lows have been seen and a bout of worthwhile corrective strength could soon come through.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold prices have broken above a medium-term downtrend line which joins the peak of the February 1996 rally with highs in late August. A close above the trendline, currently at $381.60 an ounce, would confirm that breach, analysts said.</p>
<p>Silver followed gold higher and was trading at $4.96/$4.98 an ounce, up three cents from Monday's London close.</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed to have tagged along for the ride,&quot; a dealer said. The psychological $5.00 was silver's key hurdle.</p>
<p>Platinum was trading $2.00 stronger compared to Monday's finish at $385.50/$386.50 an ounce. Palladium was $1.75 firmer at $118.25/$119.25. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
