<p>Japan is unlikely to feel the pinch from a delay in the resumption of limited Iraqi oil sales, as it can turn to other Middle Eastern crudes such as Oman and Dubai, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The United States launched another missile attack against Iraqi targets on Wednesday, heightening tensions in the area for the second consecutive day.</p>
<p>The build-up to the crisis started last month when Baghdad sent its troops to Kurdish strongholds in northern Iraq, a move which on Sunday prompted U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to postpone plans to implement an oil-for-food deal that would allow Iraq to re-enter the world oil market for the first time in six years.</p>
<p>Asked how the industry was likely to handle the delay in Iraqi crude oil shipments, a dealer with a leading Japanese trading company said: &quot;Nothing's going to change. We will continue to buy Oman and Dubai.&quot;</p>
<p>In August, Japanese firms began to register with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to conduct negotiations for the import of Iraqi oil and oil products.</p>
<p>MITI officials declined to provide details of the progress of the registration process, but Japanese oil industry sources said most companies had probably registered, although it was not clear how strong their immediate interest was.</p>
<p>A trader with a major Japanese oil company said that although the possibility of replacing Oman and Dubai with Iraqi crude had been considered, the idea had faded by now amid the current crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it just means that Dubai and Oman will continue to be bought according to our initial plan,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said this was unlikely to lead to a sharp increase in imports of the two Middle Eastern crudes, but meant instead it was unlikely that imports of Oman and Dubai would decrease and be replaced by Iraqi oil.</p>
<p>Japan was a large consumer of Iraqi oil before Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It imported 217,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iraqi crude oil in 1989, representing 8.5 percent of its crude oil imports from the Middle East for that year, according to government statistics.</p>
<p>Although no Iraqi oil has been available on global markets since a U.N. sanction was imposed against Baghdad for its invasion, Japan has since found other alternatives to the medium-grade crude oil that it used to buy from Iraq.</p>
<p>Most traders acknowledge that Japanese companies are interested in Iraqi crudes, and would probably buy the crude if the price proved to be attractive.</p>
<p>However, they added that Japanese companies are not in a hurry to make their purchases, particularly as they have managed without Iraqi crude for six years.</p>
<p>Tsutomu Toichi, director at the Institute of Energy Economics Japan, said that apart from Oman and Dubai, Arabian Light and Iranian Light could also serve as possible alternatives to Basrah Light, the Iranian crude that Japanese traders have traditionally purchased.</p>
<p>He noted that Basrah Light is a medium-grade crude with a 34 degree API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity and a sulphur content of 1.9 percent. This is very similar to Arabian Light's API gravity of 33 and sulphur content of 1.8 percent and Iranian Light's API gravity of 34 and sulphur content of 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>An oil industry source said that Japanese traders could turn to either Arabian Light or Iranian Light if the price of Oman or Dubai were to rise sharply.</p>
