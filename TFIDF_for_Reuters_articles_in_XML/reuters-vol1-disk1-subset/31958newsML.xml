<p>Daimler Benz will need approximately 2.5 billion marks ($1.7 billion) for its Mercedes Benz projects and joint-ventures in Asia till the year 2000, said Hans-Jurgen Schnell, managing director of Daimler-Benz Asia Pte Ltd, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Schnell, who was speaking to Reuters at the official launch of the group's finance and treasury centre in Singapore, also said the group had been given a finance and treasury licence by the Singapore authorities.</p>
<p>The licence would give Daimler-Benz certain tax concessions for the group's regional activities which are booked in Singapore.</p>
<p>Manfred Gentz, Daimler's chief financial officer who was at the launch of the centre, said the finance and treasury centre in Singapore would support the group's presence in Asia where it currently has 73 business units.</p>
<p>He said group annual turnover in Southeast Asia amount to more than 2.8 billion marks and Singapore alone accounts for 700 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The treasury centre will complement the group's growing activities in the area,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Schnell, who will be based in Singapore as head of the new centre, said the group needs to look into the project financing needs of Mercedes Benz in Asia. Funds would be needed to to build new plants, set up new joint-ventures and expand existing operations, he said.</p>
<p>The centre would have to find the &quot;appropriate financing structures&quot; for the various projects. &quot;We would like to tap the funds and liquidity not only in Singapore but in neighbouring countries,&quot; he said.</p>
