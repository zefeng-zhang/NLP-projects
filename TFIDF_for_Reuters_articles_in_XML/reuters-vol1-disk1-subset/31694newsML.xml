<p>Monthly living costs in Croatia were 0.8 percent lower in August after a 1.0 percent decrease in goods prices, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, they rose 5.3 percent between January and August this year compared with a year ago. August's year-on-year increase was 6.0 percent, according to official figures.</p>
<p>The price of food, estimated to account for more than a half of basic living costs, fell 2.2 percent on a monthly level. Clothing, drinks and tobacco rose marginally.</p>
<p>Rents were down 0.2 percent from July, while increasing 1.3 percent from August 1995.</p>
<p>Services prices eased 0.1 percent for the first time this year. But due to an earlier uncontrolled increase, they were a whole 10.0 percent higher than a year ago.</p>
<p>Monthly retail price inflation was flat in August. But with another four months until the end of 1996, it stood at 4.7 percent on an annual level, just within the 3-5 percent target. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
