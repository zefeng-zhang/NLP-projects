<p>The United States did not consult Turkey's Islamist premier before firing dozens of cruise missiles at Iraq, diplomats and officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. attitude underlined its mistrust of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's leadership and could put at risk Western enforcement of the no-fly zone over Iraq's rebel north, they said.</p>
<p>Senior officials and diplomats said the United States had not consulted Erbakan before firing dozens of cruise missiles at his big southern neighbour on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nor, they said, did Washington ask NATO-member Turkey for permission to use its Incirlik airbase to stage the attacks, fearing a rebuff. The base is already home to U.S., British and French jets patrolling the skies over northern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey was informed but not necessarily consulted,&quot; a western diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>That posture, say analysts, could undercut the West's policy of containment against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein -- based on the twin pillars of military exclusion zones to protect restive Iraqi minorities and crippling economic sanctions.</p>
<p>&quot;They certainly seemed to have by-passed Erbakan,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. embassy in Ankara handed a brief message from President Bill Clinton to Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, the pro-Western junior coalition partner.</p>
<p>Turkish and U.S. sources confirmed this account, highlighting a groundswell of uneasiness between the two countries since Erbakan, secular Turkey's first Islamist leader, took power in June.</p>
<p>Erbakan has not commented on the U.S. missile attacks, brushing aside reporters' questions about the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;Relations are formed between equals, this is a rule of protocol,&quot; said one senior Turkish official. &quot;But the United States, seeing itself as a superpower, has often ignored international rules of protocol.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister, whose Islam-based Welfare Party campaigned on an end to Turkey's NATO role amid a general turn to the East, makes Washington uncomfortable, he said. &quot;The Americans do not find Erbakan's attitude one of respect.&quot;</p>
<p>The result is a policy of neglect that threatens Turkey's continued support for the U.S.-led air patrols over northern Iraq -- known as Operation Provide Comfort by the allies and as Poised Hammer by the Turks.</p>
<p>Already, Erbakan has bowed to pressure from Washington and its friends in the Turkish military, reversing his long-standing opposition to Provide Comfort and forcing renewal of the mission through a sceptical parliament in July.</p>
<p>Fresh approval is required in late December and passage is far from assured.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Turkish angle has been neglected,&quot; acknowledged one NATO diplomat. &quot;It will make it that much harder to win approval for Provide Comfort next time.&quot;</p>
<p>There is more of &quot;a comfort zone&quot; with Ciller, Erbakan's U.S.-educated predecessor and now foreign minister, he said.</p>
<p>Erbakan has long touted a realignment of Turkish foreign policy, warming toward neighbours Iraq, Iran and Syria at the expense of the West, Washington in particular.</p>
<p>Turkey is also itching to restore trade ties with Iraq, its third biggest partner before U.N. sanctions were slapped on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
