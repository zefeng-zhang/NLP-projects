<p>A United Nations agency is urgently trying to evacuate 21 ill Palestinians, at least three in danger of dying, from the Egyptian-Libyan border where they have been stranded for more than a year, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Panos Moumtzis said more than 200 Palestinians faced a harsh winter at the desert wasteland camp which the agency has declared &quot;unfit for human beings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions are absolutely appalling,&quot; he told a news conference. &quot;The whole place is really a rubbish dump.&quot;</p>
<p>The cases include an eight-year-old girl with a heart problem, a woman in the last stages of a difficult pregnancy, and a man with complications from diabetes, Moumtzis said.</p>
<p>He said the woman's distraught husband phoned him that morning from the border saying she was bleeding and feverish.</p>
<p>&quot;They could die at any moment,&quot; he said of the three.</p>
<p>Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered last year the expulsion of 30,000 Palestinians to expose what he sees as a hollow peace deal between their leaders and Israel.</p>
<p>Most of the deportees went on to other countries but Egypt has refused to let in those without proof that they can leave the country by another border. Israel controls access to the autonomous West Bank and Gaza Strip and does not allow entry except to those who were residents of the territories.</p>
<p>Talks between Palestinians and Israelis on transferring land to Palestinian self-rule have snagged on Israeli reluctance to redeploy its troops in Hebron for security concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to keep in mind the root of the problem is the Arab-Israeli conflict. However these people have to get out of this place. We want to call to the whole world to do something immediately if we want to save their lives,&quot; Moumtzis said.</p>
<p>So far no country has agreed to take the Palestinians but UNHCR representative Mohamed Boukry said they were trying through diplomatic channels to find at least a temporary solution.</p>
<p>He said they were trying to evacuate the sick refugees to Tobruk, about 130 km (78 miles) inside Libya from the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an official announcement made at the Arab League by the Libyan ambassador that these people can go back, however at the border we saw that that was not the reality,&quot; said Moumtzis. The UNHCR last visited the camp on October 16-18.</p>
<p>About 90 of the refugees are children, the youngest about two months old, and some are missing their second school year at the camp, which has six latrines for 200 people.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that everybody could move but right now we hope that at least these 21 cases at risk could move out...to save lives,&quot; Moumtzis said. &quot;Right now they're stuck between two border checkpoints. Nobody else will take them.&quot;</p>
