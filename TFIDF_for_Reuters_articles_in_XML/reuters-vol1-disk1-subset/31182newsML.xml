<p>Food distribution company Booker Plc said it had made an agreed cash and shares offer for food wholesaler Nurdin &amp; Peacock Plc, valuing Nurdin at around 264 million stg.  </p>
<p>Under the offer, Nurdin shareholders will receive 14 new Booker shares and 154.53 stg in cash for every 100 Nurdin shares.</p>
<p>Based on a Booker share price of 360.5p per share, the offer values Nurdin shares at 205p.</p>
<p>Nurdin shares closed at 130.5p on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Booker said Nurdin shareholders may elect for a full cash alternative of 201p per share or to receive additional shares in place of all or part of the cash element.</p>
<p>Booker has received irrevocable undertakings to accept from shareholders representing some 28 pct of Nurdin shares.  </p>
<p>These include charitable and other trusts asscociated with the Peacock family.</p>
<p>Booker said it expects to derive &quot;clear and significant economic benefits&quot; from the combination with Nurdin.</p>
<p>&quot;The combined food wholesaling business will have major opportunities to improve its buying efficiency, reduce its costs and reduce its working capital,&quot; the companies said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Booker said it expects annual cost savings of 10 million stg in the first full year and expects this to more than double over the following two years.  </p>
<p>Booker said it will make a 52 million stg provision for one-off restructuring charges in 1996.</p>
<p>Nurdin chairman Richard Fulford said it had been clear for some time that the food wholesaling industry was in for a period of rationalisation in response to pressures from food retailing multiples.</p>
