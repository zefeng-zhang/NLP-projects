<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Wednesday that the Commission had agreed a compromise regarding illegal subsidies paid to Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>Under the deal Germany will freeze an amount of money that it had planned to give the carmaker, neutralising illegal aid granted by the German state of Saxony.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission therefore will not have to take any action,&quot; Van Miert told a news conference, referring to plans for an interim court injunction.</p>
<p>&quot;At the federal level there is a commitment to freeze an amount which is equivalent or parallel to that (contested) amount.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Commission, however, reserved the right to reopen the issue should Germany not respect its commitment. It would still bring an infringement case to court, likely to last for some years, on the principle of the issue.</p>
<p>The Commission approved 540 million marks of a planned 780 million marks in proposed subsidies to VW to build two plants in the state of Saxony. But it charged that at least 100 million marks more than the approved amount had been illegally handed over to the carmaker.</p>
<p>VW had threatened in the past to take its investment elsewhere if the subsidies did not go through.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Van Miert said that VW had actually recieved 91 million marks in illegal money. He said there had been suspicions that another 16 millon marks was also illegal, but that German authorities had confirmed on Tuesday night that that money was a legal loan granted under market conditions.</p>
<p>Van Miert said that meant that the German federal government would freeze 91 million marks.</p>
