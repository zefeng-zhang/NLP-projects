<p>U.S.-led allies began patrolling a no-fly zone extended to Baghdad's outskirts on Wednesday after a second U.S. cruise missile strike against Iraqi air defences, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>A Pentagon official said there were no immediate Iraqi violations of the new no-fly zone, extended at noon Iraqi time (0800 GMT) to the 33rd parallel on Baghdad's southern suburbs.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to have been successful,&quot; Deputy National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said of the latest missile strike on NBC Television's Today Show.</p>
<p>He did not rule out further attacks after the second wave of American cruise missiles attacked Iraqi anti-aircraft missile defences.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now we are confident that the risk is such that we can implement Operation Southern Watch&quot; in the newly-extended zone, General Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the military joint chiefs of staff, said at a Pentagon briefing.</p>
<p>Though France has expressed reservations about the U.S. cruise missile attacks, Ralston said French Mirage fighter planes along with U.S. and British planes were patrolling the no-fly zone.</p>
<p>He refused to say whether there would be any further U.S. strikes. He said U.S. forces will be watching to see if new anti-aircraft missiles are moved into the zone.</p>
<p>&quot;So far in Operation Southern Watch, the enforcement of the no-fly zone this morning, we noted no violations (by Iraqi planes),&quot; Ralston said.</p>
<p>In fact, he said, some Iraqi planes left two air bases in the new part of the zone shortly before the deadline.</p>
<p>An Iraqi newspaper said a pilotless U.S. plane was shot down but when Ralston was asked if any U.S. planes or missiles had been shot down, he said &quot;We have no evidence that that's true.&quot;</p>
<p>He said 27 U.S. cruise missiles were fired at about 15 targets including missile sites, radars and communications sites in the Iraq zone early on Tuesday. Seventeen more were fired at four of the targets in the second wave on Wednesday Iraq time because cloud cover left doubts whether these targets were destroyed in the first strike.</p>
<p>After Iraq President Saddam Hussein defied U.S. warnings to keep his troops and warplanes out of Kurdish-held territory in northern Iraq, President Bill Clinton ordered the missile strikes.</p>
<p>Clinton also announced the United States would no longer tolerate any Iraqi warplane flights in an area of southern Iraq extending northward from the Kuwait border to the southern suburbs of Baghdad.</p>
<p>Clinton has not said what Saddam must do to avoid further military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>Clinton administration officials called Saddam a menace to world security, a danger to his neighbours and a threat to the vital flow of oil from the Gulf.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the U.S. would strike again if Saddam pulled his troops out of northern Iraq. U.S. intelligence late on Tuesday had detected the movement of Iraqi forces in the north but called the shift inconclusive. The Pentagon did not rule out additional air strikes even if Saddam pulled out his troops.</p>
<p>&quot;We reserve the right to conduct further military actions,&quot; Defence Secretary William Perry said on Tuesday. &quot;One factor which would influence whether we conduct those is what he (Saddam) does in the future, but that's not the only factor.&quot;</p>
<p>The first strike was deplored by Saddam who accused the Americans of cowardice in hiding behind their sophisticated weaponry and ordered his pilots to ignore the no-fly zone.</p>
<p>He said five people had been killed and 19 injured in the first attack, some of whom were civilians, but Perry disputed that account, saying it was &quot;exceedingly unlikely&quot; that there would have been any civilian casualties because the targets were not near any populated or residential areas.</p>
<p>In the second attack, the Iraqi News Agency said one person was killed and seven injured.</p>
