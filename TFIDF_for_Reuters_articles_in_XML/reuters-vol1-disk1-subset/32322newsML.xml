<p>The hurricane watch for the U.S. East Coast was extended northward Wednesday as Hurricane Fran headed northward east of the U.S. coast, National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>At 1100 EDT/1500 GMT, Hurricane Fran was near latitude 27.4 north and longitude 75.0 west, or about 485 miles (780 km) southeast of Charleston, S.C. The storm continued to wobble along a northwest track near 12 mph (19 kmh), which motion was expected to continue Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Maximum sustained winds were near 115 mph (185 kmh) and some strengthening was possible during the next 24 hours.  </p>
<p>At 1100, a hurricane watch, warning of the arrival of hurricane conditions within 36 hours was in effect from north of Sebastian Inlet, Fla., to Oregon Inlet, N.C., including Pamlico Sound.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning, indicating that hurricane conditions were expected within 24 hours, was likely to be issued Wednesday evening for a portion of the watch area, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning remained in effect for the northwestern Bahamas.</p>
<p>Fran also had grown in size, as hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 175 miles (280 km) from the center and tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 290 miles (465 km) mainly to the northweast.  </p>
<p>Tides of 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 km) above normal were expected over parts of the northwest Bahamas and swells were beginning to increase along the southeast U.S. coast.</p>
<p>Fran was joined by another strong weather system, as the eighth tropical depression of the season formed in the Atlantic and forecasters said it likely would become Tropical Storm Hortense later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At 1100, tropical depression eight was near latitude 14.9 north and longitude 47.4 west, or about 925 miles (1500 km) east of the Less Antilles.</p>
<p>The depression was moving west near 15 mph (24 kmh), general motion expected to continue for the next 24 hours. Maximum sustained winds were near 35 mph (55 kmh), with gusts to tropical storm force of 39 mph (63 kmh).</p>
