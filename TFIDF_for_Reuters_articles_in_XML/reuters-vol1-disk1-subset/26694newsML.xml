<p>Oil prices made sharp gains on Monday after the United Nations put oil sales by Iraq on hold, while the dollar and London share prices also benefited from renewed tension in the Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a real kick for the markets,&quot; said Oystein Berentsen, crude trading manager for Norway's Statoil.</p>
<p>Weekend incursions by Iraqi troops into Kurdish areas gave some support to the dollar, often a safe haven currency, but dealers said a more vital factor was growing market speculation about higher U.S. interest rates by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraqi stuff is a small support. The main factor is the possibility of higher U.S. rates,&quot; said one British bank dealer.</p>
<p>Buoyant oil shares following the rise in crude prices led the London stock market, Europe's biggest, to recoup some recent losses. But interest rate concerns brought it back from its highs and other key European bourses put on a mixed performance.</p>
<p>&quot;The market rose on the strength of oils this morning,&quot; said one senior London share trader. &quot;If we took the oils out, it (the London stock market) would be barely changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers on various European markets said the Labor Day holiday in the United States kept trading activity low.</p>
<p>October futures for benchmark Brent crude opened 70 cents a barrel higher at $21.48 on London's International Petroleum Exchange after the United Nations delayed implementation of an oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Traders had been expecting Iraq's first oil sales for six years since the Gulf War to hit markets in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The oil futures price extended its gain to $1 at one point and was up 89 cents in mid-afternoon. The price of jet fuel hit its highest level for five years.</p>
<p>&quot;With demand so strong and oil stocks so low, the market was looking as if it could quite easily have absorbed some Iraqi exports,&quot; Berentsen said.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said Iraqi troops had now evacuated Arbil, Iraqi Kurdistan's capital which they captured on Saturday.</p>
<p>London shares slipped from their highs after strong British economic data dimmed hopes of an interest rate cut after the next regular monetary meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bank of England governor on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The August PMI purchasing managers index rose to 51.8, its highest level in a year. A majority of economists polled by Reuters forecast Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke would resist the temptation to cut rates when he meets Bank of England governor Eddie George.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Clarke would dearly love to reduce base rates, the economic background that he faces would be against that, and he wouldn't want to reduce base rates now and end up being forced to raise them nearer the time of a general election,&quot; said Andy Cates, U.K. economist at UBS.</p>
<p>But most economists said the situation was finely balanced and several felt Clarke could snatch a chance to cut rates one more time before an election, which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>German shares end bourse trade lower as the U.S. holiday scuppered hopes of the market finding new impetus.</p>
<p>The inclination to do business was similarly lacking in Paris, where the market was moderately higher, tracking a recovery in bonds and erasing early losses in quiet trading.</p>
<p>Euro Disney shares rallied around five percent after Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said it was on track to show a second annual profit.</p>
<p>The dollar rose well above 1.48 marks and hit six-week highs above 109 yen ahead of the next major statistics which may hold clues on where U.S. interest rates might be going and when.</p>
<p>Tuesday will bring news on the U.S. NAPM purchasing managers' index for August and Friday the key U.S. August non-farm payrolls data.</p>
<p>Second-quarter economic growth figures for France and Germany are also on the week's menu of statistics and could put further pressure on the French franc, analysts said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 109.17 yen and 1.4865 marks, compared with 108.70 and 1.4800 in late business on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was up 10.2 at 3,877.8.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index ended floor trade down 10.95 at 2,532.88. In Paris, the CAC-40 index was up 8.29 at 1,978.90.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $386.55 an ounce in the afternoon, compared with the morning fix of $386.90 and Friday's close of $386.35. Silver was up three cents at $5.19.</p>
