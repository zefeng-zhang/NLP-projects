<p>Thousands joined in prayer on Sunday for Mother Teresa, the Catholic nun whose devotion to the poor has inspired the world, as she fought for life against a weakening heart in a Calcutta hospital.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, admitted to hospital on Tuesday with malarial fever and severe vomiting, is conscious but in grave condition as her heart remains vulnerable, a hospital official said.</p>
<p>The 85-year-old nun remained on a respirator in intensive care and was still being fed intravenously.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother Teresa's condition shows no appreciable change,&quot; Dr S.K. Sen, medical director of the Woodlands Nursing Home, told reporters. &quot;Her cardiac irregularity is under control but she still needs respiratory support. She still has a low-grade fever.&quot;</p>
<p>Thousands of people, including Moslems and Hindus, joined in Roman Catholic Sunday services at churches across India in a spontaneous outpouring of concern for the Nobel peace laureate.</p>
<p>Special prayers were held at the Mother House, the sprawling headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity, the order Mother Teresa founded 47 years ago to help the poor and destitute.</p>
<p>&quot;Even a maulvi (Moslem cleric) came and knelt in the chapel,&quot; said Sister Priscilla, a senior nun.</p>
<p>She said several Hindus and Moslems had also visited Mother House to inquire about Mother Teresa. &quot;She is a living saint for everybody here,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>More than 100 nuns and volunteers gathered at Sunday mass to pray for Mother Teresa, also known as the Saint of the Gutters for devoting her life to the poor.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother continues to struggle. I believe there are only certain things medicines can do,&quot; said Father Jeff Bayhy, who said the mass. &quot;Mother is one of those people God has a plan for. God has a special plan for her.&quot;</p>
<p>Bayhy, from Baton Rouge in Louisiana, has known Mother Teresa for 10 years and regularly visits her in Calcutta.</p>
<p>&quot;They love Mother and they don't want her to die but they don't fear her dying if that is what God has in store,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa was conscious, but had not spoken to anyone, Dr. Sen said. Anything could hapen, given her age, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It might take days. At this age, anything could happen,&quot; Sen said in reply to a question about how long Mother Teresa would be on the respirator. Her doctors have forbidden visitors.</p>
<p>A panel of six specialists have maintained a round-the-clock vigil over Mother Teresa, whose heart was fitted with a pacemaker in 1989.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mother Teresa's fever fell slightly and Sen had said she was showing surprising strength, though her weak heart complicated the picture.</p>
<p>&quot;She is showing enormous strength, given her age, which has surprised all of us,&quot; Sen told reporters.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's 86th birthday is next Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;She is greater than any mother in this world. I would have died of cold if I hadn't come here,&quot; said Nada, one of about 100 destitutes at Mother Teresa's Calcutta shelter for the homeless.</p>
<p>Nada spent a year rummaging through rubbish heaps and begging for food in Calcutta's streets before he came to Mother Teresa's home. Now he, like others in the shelter, is praying for Mother Teresa to recover and resume her daily rounds.</p>
<p>&quot;All of them are praying to God for Mother's recovery,&quot; said Sister Dolores, one of six nuns who work in the home.</p>
<p>&quot;None of them has ever seen a bible, but they are praying because they know it could save Mother.&quot;</p>
