<p>Czech engineering group Skoda a.s., a local agent for U.S.-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. is proposing a barter deal to encourage the Czech government to buy MD's F/A-18 &quot;Hornet&quot; fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Skoda's spokesman Karel Samec said Wednesday his firm would provide trucks made at Skoda's troubled Tatra a.s. and other goods in return for planes, which the cash-strapped Czech military is considering to upgrade its fleet.</p>
<p>&quot;McDonnell Douglas chose us as intermediator, but it depends on the Czech government and the Defence Ministry which has to decide if they want to buy any planes at all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a barter deal. They would supply the fighters, and we would supply Czech goods to the States, namely Tatras and other things... And I know from the American side that this project has the support of the U.S. government,&quot; Samec added.</p>
<p>The Czechs along with former Warsaw Pact allies Poland and Hungary, all seen as frontrunners to join NATO, want to upgrade their fleets to be compatible with the military alliance.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas is competing against Lockheed Martin, makers of the F-16, Sweden's SAAB, which makes the &quot;Gripen,&quot; France's &quot;Mirage,&quot; and others to update a fleet of ageing Soviet-made Mig-21 planes.</p>
<p>However, the Czech government has delayed a decision on buying the planes because proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading the army's ageing fighters. A spokesman at the Defence Ministry was not immediately avbailable for comment.</p>
