<title>UK: China's booming TV market looks to advertising.</title>
<headline>China's booming TV market looks to advertising.</headline>

<p>China's television market, the world's biggest in terms of viewers, is expanding rapidly into cable and depending increasingly on advertising, a report released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Zenith Media said in its report on television in Asia that 73 percent of all homes in China were believed to have television, suggesting a staggering potential audience of 875 million people.</p>
<p>It said television was China's most popular medium and that television revenue soared by 65 percent in 1995 and total advertising expenditure by 53 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Advertising revenue has flooded in&quot; since television in China was partly deregulated in 1987, said Zenith, the media-planning and buying arm of Cordiant Plc, said it its report &quot;Television in Asia Pacific to 2001&quot;.</p>
<p>Zenith said China had 980 terrestrial TV channels, comprising eight nationwide, 73 provincial, 499 county and 400 city channels.</p>
<p>It said people in Beijing watched an average 158 minutes of television each day.</p>
<p>&quot;Government subsidy has virtually disappeared from national and provincial television, and is ebbing away from the cities, replaced by advertising revenue,&quot; Zenith said.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial independence is much greater than television's editorial independence, but (TV) is no longer simply an agent of state propaganda,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Zenith said political documentaries that used to take up a lot of television airtime have given way to drama, movies, sport and entertainment.</p>
<p>Until 1992 China's television marketplace was basically confined to the provinces of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong.</p>
<p>But by 1996, the three provinces, while still representing the main market, accounted for only a third of the money spent on television throughout China.</p>
<p>Zenith said a larger proportion of money was being spent in other provinces due to competition for advertising budgets, rising professionalism in the television world and popularity of local services.</p>
<p>Zenith said Chinese authorities had been keen to develop cable TV &quot;as a bulwark against Western culture&quot;, hoping to hinder the spread of foreign satellite dishes by promoting local cable services.</p>
<p>Television airtime in China is cheap, with advertisers able to reach an average 1,000 viewers with each 10 to 50 cents they spend.</p>
<p>That so-called &quot;cost-per-thousand&quot; is barely five percent of the price for television airtime in Hong Kong, Zenith said.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities do not license foreign companies to participate in terrestrial television distribution, nor do they allow direct foreign investment in broadcasters of cable distributors, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Multinationals wishing to tap into the potentially enormous Chinese television market have therefore concentrated on satellite television services,&quot; it said.</p>
