<title>USA: US money managers less bullish on US debt -- MCM.</title>
<headline>US money managers less bullish on US debt -- MCM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fixed-income managers remained heavily invested in U.S. debt markets in the past week but reported a less bullish outlook, said the latest MCM MoneyWatch Inc asset allocation survey.</p>
<p>&quot;This group (of investors) is playing the broader range,&quot; said MCM money market analyst Peter McTeague. &quot;They are less bullish.&quot;</p>
<p>The weekly survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark rose to 105.7 percent in the week ended September 3 from 105.6 percent in the prior week.  </p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market. A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.</p>
<p>In the &quot;next likely move&quot; category, portfolio managers representing 20 percent of total assets in the survey said they would &quot;buy,&quot; down from 22 percent the prior week.</p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward &quot;sell&quot; rose to 24 percent, up from 19 percent in the week ended August 26.</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of managers said they were &quot;neutral&quot; on the market, down from 59 percent a week ago.  </p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 3.10 percent, against 3.12 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>The survey showed 28 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, down from 32 percent in the previous week, while 42 percent underweighted it. The remaining 30 percent were &quot;neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 33 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 20 percent underweighted them.  </p>
<p>The survey included 38 domestic participants, who manage about $90.0 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM.  </p>
