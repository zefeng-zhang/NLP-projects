<p>The Southern African country of Mozambique said on Wednesday that it was opening its arms to the free market.</p>
<p>The country has been wracked by decades of war between its once-avowedly communist government and right-wing rebels.</p>
<p>But prime minister Pascoal Mocumbi said the only way forward for the country, which has now enjoyed two years of peace, was to embrace free market principles.</p>
<p>&quot;Mozambique will have to work hand in hand with the private sector. It is partnership between the government and the private sector that will ensure success,&quot; he told the Southern African Trade and Investment Summit being held in Harare.</p>
<p>Mozambique is rich in natural resources that have been largely untapped because of the war. Of its 10 million hectares of arable land, only about one fifth is being exploited.</p>
<p>The country also has substantial coal, mineral and gas resources.</p>
<p>&quot;After years of conflict our region today is at peace...Mozambique is a viable destination for investment in Southern Africa,&quot; Mocumbi said.</p>
