<p>Australian businesses expect to sign a series of deals with China during a trade mission next week lead by Trade Minister Tim Fischer, Fischer said on Sunday.</p>
<p>He said in a statement he would hold negotiations with senior members of the Chinese government during his seven-day visit to Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian and Guangzho, beginning on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of commercial deals are expected to be signed,&quot; Fischer said. No further details were available.  </p>
<p>Fischer will arrive in Shanghai on an inaugural Sydney-Shanghai flight by Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;The extended trade visit reflects the growing importance of Australia's trade relations with China and it is an added boost to have direct air links between Australia and China spreading to include key hubs such as Shanghai,&quot; Fischer said.</p>
<p>China is Australia's sixth-largest trading partner, with two-way trade totalling A$6.6 billion in the fiscal year to June 30, 1995, the last full year for which figures are available.  </p>
<p>Trade more than doubled between 1990/91 and 1994/95, rising to A$6.6 billion from A$2.8 billion.</p>
<p>But relations between the two countries have chilled over recent months over a range of diplomatic and security issues.</p>
<p>Beijing has protested against the axing of an Australian soft loan aid scheme, plans for an Australian minister to visit Taiwan, a new security pact between Canberra and Washington and the planned visit to Australia next month by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.  </p>
<p>Australian Defence Minister Ian McLachlan, in a newspaper interview published on Saturday, criticised what he said was China's increasingly assertive foreign policy, warning it could scare much-needed foreign investment away.</p>
<p>Fischer will visit Hong Kong on September 4-5 before flying home.</p>
