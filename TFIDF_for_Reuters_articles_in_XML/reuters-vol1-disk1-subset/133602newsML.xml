<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shares end lower on stronger shekel.</title>
<headline>Israeli shares end lower on stronger shekel.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli shares closed broadly lower on Tuesday in dull trading following a sharp rise of the shekel, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 1.70 percent, or 3.25 points, to 187.78 on low turnover of 53 million shekels against 73 million on Monday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index lost 1.56 percent to 198.03.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnover was very low and it was difficult to trade today,&quot; said Daniella Finn, head of sales at Batucha Securities and Investments. &quot;Last week the market rose following the depreciation of the shekel. Now that the shekel is rising the market is falling again. The market depends now on changes in the forex trading,&quot;</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed on Tuesday at 3.2460 shekels against 3.2690 on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market followed the dollar today. In early trading the shekel rose sharply and the market plunged. When the shekel stopped rising we saw a slight correction,&quot; said a trader at Bank Hapoalim.</p>
<p>&quot;A rate cut of at least one percent will push the dollar upward, and the market will rise. A cut of less than 0.5 percentage point will achieve the opposite,&quot; Finn said.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the announcement on interest rates the market will continue to be very nervous,&quot; the Hapoalim trader said.</p>
<p>The central bank will announce interest rates for November on October 28. The key short-term rate is now 15.5 percent.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which fell 2.75 percent to 140,394 on volume of 3.5 million shekels; Koor Industries, which lost 1.5 percent to 29,269 on turnover of 3.4 million shekels; and Discount Investments, which gained 1.25 percent to 18,015 on volume of 2.5 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.246 shekels)</p>
