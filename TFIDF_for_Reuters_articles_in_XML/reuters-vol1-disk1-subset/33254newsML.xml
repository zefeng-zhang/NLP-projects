<p>A strike by Portuguese train drivers which paralysed rail transport for six days has ended and services resumed on Wednesday, railway and trade union officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;All services, including passengers and goods, began this morning,&quot; said a source in Portuguese state railway company Caminhos de Ferros Portugueses (CP).</p>
<p>Antonio Madeiros, a spokesman for the National Union of Portuguese Train Drivers, confirmed that his union had agreed with CP management late on Tuesday to end the strike involving some 1,500 drivers, which had been due to go on until Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are satisfied with the guarantees by the company to respect existing agreements,&quot; Madeiros told Reuters.</p>
<p>He was referring to agreements under which CP had pledged to improve career structures and set a nine-hour limit to the working day and 45-minute rest periods between journeys.</p>
<p>Madeiros said that before the strike CP had failed to respect the agreements, sometimes forcing drivers to work up to 13 hours a day and ignoring rules on rest periods.</p>
<p>The CP source said transport of coal by rail from the port of Sines to the 600 MegaWatt power station at Pego in central Portugal should resume on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The strike had halted the transport of 4,500 tonnes a day of coal from Sines to Pego, although stocks were sufficient to meet the electricity needs of customers nationwide, officials said.</p>
