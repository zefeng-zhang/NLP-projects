<title>UK: Pearson jumps on BSkyB bid rumour.</title>
<headline>Pearson jumps on BSkyB bid rumour.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>Shares in Pearson rose sharply in pre-market trade on Monday following press reports that BSkyB was planning to launch a four billion stg takeover bid for the diversified media group.</p>
<p>The shares were indicated 32p higher at 728-1/2p by 0720 GMT.</p>
<p>The daily Independent newspaper said on Monday that the satellite broadcaster was in the early stages of mounting a bid in cooperation with a U.S. based media group. A spokesman for BSkyB declined to comment.  </p>
<p>&quot;Its one thing to push the shares up on thin volume and hot air,&quot; said Anthony De Larrinaga, analyst at Panmure Gordon. &quot;But it's quite another to place 5 billion pounds worth of equity, it could be classic froth at the top of the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The resurgence of bid rumours in recent weeks has propelled the FTSE 100 index to record levels.</p>
<p>In a separate report the Sunday Times said Pearson was set to hive off its television interests either by joint venture or sale. &quot;This is really what has started the speculation, it may be that BSkyB want to acquire Grundy or Thames Television but whether they would want the entire group is another matter.&quot;  </p>
<p>But the analyst did not rule out a possible bid by BSkyB for the entire Pearson group.</p>
<p>&quot;BSkyB's valuation is touching the stratosphere at these levels,&quot; Larrinaga said. &quot;It makes some sense that they would consider expanding into other more mature operations.&quot;</p>
<p>At current levels, after a sharp rise in its share price recently, the satellite broadcaster has a market capitalisation of about 12 billion stg.</p>
<p>Analysts said Pearson's shares were now approaching the top end of their price target range for full valuation of the standalone business.  </p>
<p>The resurgence of bid rumours surrounding Pearson comes after the appointment of new chairman Dennis Stevenson and chief executive Marjorie Scardino last week, who are both said to be supporters of a smaller, more focused range of activities.</p>
