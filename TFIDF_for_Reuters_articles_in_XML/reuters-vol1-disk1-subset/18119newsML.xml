<headline>London precious metals quiet ahead of options expiry.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-28</dateline>

<p>The precious metals markets were quiet and prices mildly mixed on Wednesday as dealers stood by for the expiry of off-market options at 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $388.65 per ounce after $388.80 on Tuesday afternoon and $389.00, the high since August 5, that morning.</p>
<p>There was little in overnight business to give Europe direction. The New York markets were mainly slightly softer ahead of the expiry and an upcoming three-day weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not expecting too much before the expiry and after that they could turn lower,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Options give their owner the right but not the obligation to buy a commodity at a fixed price, called the strike price, at a given time, known as the expiry date.</p>
<p>Often they can influence the direction of physical gold prices as the option sellers buy gold to cover their likely liabilities when the options expire.</p>
<p>If they are not called upon to deliver gold to the option holders, the consequent selling can drive prices lower.</p>
<p>Tokyo gold futures were marked up in response to a slightly weaker yen following a below-forecast Bank of Japan (BOJ) business confidence report.</p>
<p>The BOJ's quarterly survey showed the index of business conditions for major manufacturers was much lower than in the previous quarter and well below forecasts.</p>
<p>The report coincided with the release of statistics showing Japan's gold imports for the first seven months of 1996 at 95.55 tonnes versus 178.73 in the like 1995 period as the weaker yen pushed up retail gold prices and crushed investment and jewellery demand.</p>
<p>But dealers said the gold market generally was receiving some support from physical buying although interest was still low-key.</p>
<p>Silver opened slightly firmer but soon returned to flat against Tuesday's $5.24 close.</p>
<p>&quot;Silver has had a nice bounce (from under $5.00 late July), but $5.25 is likely to be the level until the expiry. After that it's a flip of a coin whether it goes up or down,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Silver was giving off mixed signals, market sources said.</p>
<p>Technically it was capable of taking a shot at $5.30 and $5.40 after a couple of good closes and steady firmness through August. But interest remained stubbornly low. &quot;We are still in the summer period and business, especially in the white metals, is particularly quiet,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>Dealers put silver in a $5.15-$5.30 range medium term.</p>
<p>Platinum edged easier to straddle $400.00, down less than a dollar from the previous London close while palladium was indicated at $125.50, up $0.25.</p>
