<p>Italy's government, determined to show an unswerving commitment to join the European single currency by the end of the century, faces a sticky problem as it prepares to deliver unpalatable budgetary medicine for 1997.</p>
<p>Its worry is how to cut the public sector borrowing requirement by the promised 32.4 trillion lire ($21.4 billion) while holding true to a pledge to leave a bloated pensions system and generous public healthcare arrangements practically unscathed?</p>
<p>For many economists the simple answer is that it cannot do so without resorting to sleight of hand.</p>
<p>The government has a lot at stake. A weak budget would not only shred Italy's chances of joining European economic and monetary union (EMU) by 1999 but could result in a big delay beyond that date before it can climb on board.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left administration must present its budget to parliament by the end of September and the package has to pass into law before the year is out.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't cut five trillion lire from health spending and another five trillion from pensions you cannot produce a credible budget,&quot; said Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers say the budget will include big cuts in subsidies for state companies, a crackdown on excess spending by ministries and a new campaign to stamp out tax evasion.</p>
<p>To make matters more difficult for Prodi, the budget drama will be played out against a background of a faltering economy and threats by trade union leaders of a &quot;hot autumn&quot; of strikes as they renegotiate wage contracts.</p>
<p>This has led prominent public figures to question the wisdom of pursuing a tough fiscal policy in order to meet strict EMU guidelines if the price is a full-blown recession.</p>
<p>A stringent budget is a key plank of the government's strategy of convincing financial markets that Italy is no longer a risky investment proposition and that it should not have to pay such a high interest rate premium on its state debt.</p>
<p>The &quot;spread&quot; -- or difference in interest paid -- on Italy's main treasury instrument, the fixed-rate BTP, and Germany's 10-year Bund currently stands at 3.20 percentage points.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi is on record as saying that he checks the Bund/BTP spread several times a day.</p>
<p>The government has not yet publicly snuffed out all hope of being among the restricted circle of countries allowed into the EMU club as founding members.</p>
<p>Prodi has admitted that Italy has no chance of meeting a key qualifying target, that of narrowing its public sector deficit to within three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 1997 although it plans to reach that goal the next year.</p>
<p>The 1992 Maastricht treaty states that founding members of the EMU club will be chosen from those countries that fulfil the strict qualifying criteria by 1997.</p>
<p>However, Italy might still hope that the criteria will only be applied loosely because other countries may also fall short of qualifying, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;I think someone (in the government) hopes the criteria will be interpreted flexibly because France may not be able to meet them. Italy could argue that the same flexibility given to France should be granted to them,&quot; said a London-based economist with a major international investment bank.</p>
<p>But some economists now believe that, with slow growth biting into tax revenues, Italy's chances of cutting the debt/ GDP ratio to three percent even by end-1998 are fading.</p>
<p>&quot;That means the Maastricht criteria will be interpreted flexibly for France and Germany but not by as much as Italy would need to join as a founder,&quot; said the banker. ($1 = 1,510)</p>
