<p>Slovak blue chips close mixed in moderate trading on Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Wednesday, with losses to shares of oil and gas storage firm Nafta and oil refiner Slovnaft pulling the SAX index down.</p>
<p>Nafta accounted for a major part on of the index's 1.17 point drop, losing 35 crowns to close at 1,950. The SAX closed at 219.38.</p>
<p>Brokers characterised Nafta's drop as being psychological.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the price to fall further in near future, though it should rise in the long-term perspective to around 2,000 crowns,&quot; Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said.</p>
<p>Oil refiner Slovnaft, the most capitalised issue on the BSE, closed down only three crowns at 997, but its average price -- according to which the SAX is calculated -- eased by 2.60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The slight drop does not indicate a downward trend in the price of Slovnaft shares, as there is still interest in purchasing them and larger packages are sold for price of around 1,000 crowns,&quot; Sykora said.</p>
<p>Steel producer VSZ, which was one of the few major shares to post gains, closing up 15 crowns at 660 crowns, with brokers considering the current price of the issue as undervalued.</p>
<p>Overall volume decreased to 199,778 shares, from 240,279 shares traded on Tuesday. Turnover increased to 277.99 million crowns, from 177.32 million on Tuesday.</p>
