<p>An apartheid police chief told South Africa's &quot;truth commission&quot; on Tuesday his men had regarded killing black activists as better than arresting them and believed they had government approval to do so.</p>
<p>Retired police brigadier Jack Cronje, who commanded a secret police unit that spawned a death squad and is accused of 27 murders, said eliminating government opponents had been generally accepted behaviour among apartheid security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I understood and I am still convinced of it... (the) action against the liberation movements was sanctioned by the government of the day,&quot; said Cronje, one of five policemen asking for pardons in return for telling all about 40 state- sponsored murders in the last decade of white domination.</p>
<p>The white government's fight against the &quot;total onslaught&quot; by black liberation movements in the 1980s was part of the war against communism and had to be carried out on the military level, overseen by the state security council which included top police, soldiers and politicians.</p>
<p>&quot;A war psychosis was created by the South African government, with the use of the media, television, newspapers, churches and cultural organisations, that there was a total onslaught on the country,&quot; Cronje told the commission hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;And therefore the elimination of terrorists and activists under any circumstances was seen as justified and part of the fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Cronje, who faces trial in connection with over two dozen murders, said the only way to counter activists was to kill them. Jail was a short-term solution and the law too cumbersome.</p>
<p>As the struggle against Nelson Mandela's then-banned African National Congress and its communist allies intensified, police activity strayed further from normal policing and the judicial system.</p>
<p>Daily reports about police actions, including the murder of activists, were sent to police headquarters and then the state security council, Cronje said.</p>
<p>&quot;If anyone therefore alleges that the state security council had no knowledge of security force activities and of specific cases...it is not true,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has so far mainly heard testimony from blacks who suffered under apartheid.</p>
<p>Few people have come forward to ask for forgiveness for human rights abuses during the final 33 years of white rule.</p>
<p>Cronje and the four other policemen seeking amnesty said in an earlier submission that they doubted claims of innocence by F.W. de Klerk, the country's last white president.</p>
<p>South Africa's police commissioner from the last years of apartheid, Johan van der Merwe, told the committee on Monday that de Klerk's predecessor P.W. Botha had directly ordered dirty tricks.</p>
<p>Van der Merwe, now retired, said Botha had given instructions for the bombing of a Johannesburg building police believed was being used by the ANC during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Botha has not responded to the allegations but the commission said it expected him to do so and would subpoena him if he did not.</p>
