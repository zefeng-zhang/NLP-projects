<p>Digital Equipment Corp. said Tuesday the computer maker plans to spin off its AltaVista Internet Software Inc. unit, including the popular World Wide Web search tool named AltaVista.</p>
<p>After an initial public offering, Digital will hold 80 percent of AltaVista, which is considered one of the most powerful Internet &quot;search engines&quot; with access to more than 30 million Web pages.</p>
<p>The unit will also include other software for the Internet and corporate networks called intranets, such as security products, management software, electronic mail and workgroup collaberation software, a source close to the company said.</p>
<p>A Digital spokesman declined to give a size for the offering, but said shares of the unit will be sold to the public following regulatory approvals and upon favourable market conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the action enhances Digital's overall flexibility with respect to its Internet/Intranet software-related business,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>No price has yet been determined for the offering, he said.</p>
<p>The AltaVista search engine is currently available for free at Digital's Web sight. The rival Yahoo! website announced in June that it had agreed with Digital to offer AltaVista to its users.</p>
<p>Analysts said Microsoft Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and other companies have also entered the emerging market for search engines.</p>
<p>&quot;It's embryonic right now and a lot of people have search engines,&quot; said Gary Helmig, an analyst with Soundview Group of Stamford, Conn. &quot;Of course, (Digital's) plans are to make it an intranet software package so companies could use it to search their internal networks.&quot;</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers, Cowen &amp; Co and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co will manage the offering, Digital said in a statement.</p>
