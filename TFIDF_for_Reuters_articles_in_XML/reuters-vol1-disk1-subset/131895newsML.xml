<p>Australian National Industries Ltd said on Monday it had recorded a higher profit in the first quarter than in the same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p>However, the Holter environmental engineering group continued to incur operating losses, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very pleased to report that profits from the remaining businesses, I'm excluding Coates, are 84 percent higher than for the first quarter of last year,&quot; ANI Chairman Ted Harris told shareholders at the annual meeting.  </p>
<p>&quot;This result has been achieved on an increase of sales revenue. The group's profit in the first quarter is A$15 million before tax,&quot; Harris said.</p>
<p>He said most of the company's operations in Australia and the United States had improved their performances in the first quarter, but Comsteel's results were slightly lower due to interrupted production.</p>
<p>&quot;Holter has continued to incur operating losses, but these are unrelated to existing contracts and are due to costs involved in downsizing the business,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The group's overall improved profit performance in this quarter is a continuation of the trend which started in the second half of the last financial year,&quot; Harris said.</p>
<p>Harris did not forecast the full year result, but said that based on the first quarter improvement and on management's forecasts for the half year, ANI planned to reinstate an interim dividend payment.</p>
<p>ANI did not pay a final dividend in 1995/96 after it posted a A$213.9 million net loss for the year, due largely to abnormal losses from its Holter business.  </p>
<p>The first half dividend would be unfranked and most likely paid in April, three months earlier than the company previously paid its interim dividend.</p>
<p>ANI's operating profit fell to A$22.99 million for the full year to June 30, 1996, from A$105.62 million in 1994/95.</p>
<p>ANI's shares were down one cent at A$1.23 at 11.45 a.m. (0145 GMT)</p>
