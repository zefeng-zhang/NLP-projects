<p>Swedish finance minister Erik Asbrink on Wednesday hosed down renewed speculation about Sweden's plans for joining the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), saying public support was needed first.</p>
<p>However financial markets were upset when Asbrink, in a signed article in the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, said Sweden might choose not to join EMU when it starts in 1999.</p>
<p>The jitters sent Swedish debt yields edging up, particularly at the long end with nine year bond yields jumping 11 basis points (0.11 percentage point) to 8.16 percent, and softened the crown to 4.4800 against the mark from 4.4620 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Asbrink quickly moved to calm the markets, saying there was still no timetable drawn up and reaffirming earlier comments that the matter would go before the ruling Social Democratic Party congress in autumn 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;What I tried to express in the article is that Sweden will take the decision one year from now,&quot; Asbrink told a Reuters Financial Television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The time until then is to be used ... to have a thorough debate and then to come to a final conclusion. It is an open question as to whether we join the monetary union in the first round or not.</p>
<p>&quot;If we choose not to join at the first stage then of course we would like to have the option to join later on.&quot;</p>
<p>Askbrink said it was vital the move had popular Swedish support otherwise it would be hard to adhere to the EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to see a decision on joining EMU without quite stable support from the general public,&quot; said Asbrink.</p>
<p>To date opinion polls have shown the majority of Swedes opposed to EMU membership.</p>
<p>A survey by the Swedish Institute of Public Opinion Research (SIFO) last week found 56 percent of Swedes were opposed to joining the EMU with only 21 percent in favour.</p>
<p>But Asbrink said public opinion, although currently rather negative, could change.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm convinced the union will start according to plan. I'm convinced a number of countries will join. Sweden could be one of those countries but that's not 100 percent sure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The finance minister also acknowledged there were political problems for Sweden in joining EMU with large parts of the Social Democrats wanting Sweden to remain outside the new institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;I and the government see many advantages in Sweden joining EMU but we also see some problems and risks involved, politically and economically,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Several analysts believed Sweden may decide to wait with EMU membership even if the country would qualify to join from the start.</p>
<p>&quot;Sweden does not want to join in 1999 but wants to keep (its option) open to join soon afterwards,&quot; chief economist carl Hamilton of Handelsbanken told Reuters.</p>
<p>Economist James McKay at investment bank Paine Webber in London took a similar view.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe they will wait and watch to see how EMU emerges in the coming years to see whether it would be beneficial to Sweden,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
