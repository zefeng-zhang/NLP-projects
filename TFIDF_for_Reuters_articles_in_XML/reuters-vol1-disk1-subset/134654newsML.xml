<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. stocks were mixed in London on Tuesday, but brokers here were expecting Wall Street to ease on profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is looking a bit tired,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>However, the market could be influenced by Digital Equipment's results for its second fiscal quarter, due before Wall Street opens.</p>
<p>Technology shares were mixed, with Digital up $1/4 in London to $34-5/8. Shares in Microsoft Corp rose $3/4 to $134-3/4, buoyed by better-than-expected third quarter results, released after New York markets closed yesterday.  </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world's biggest computer software maker, said it earned a record $0.95 per share in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Shares in International Business Machines, which released its results during market hours yesterday, fell on profit-taking in London, brokers said. The shares were quoted at $129-3/4, down $1/4.</p>
<p>In other trading, shares in General Motors slipped $1/4 to $$53-5/8, despite a report in the Wall Street Journal that the car maker is close to an agreement with Canadian car workers that would end a 19-day strike.  </p>
<p>Philip Morris shares dipped $1/4 to $93-1/4 on profit-taking after a $1-1/4-gain in New York yesterday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the December S&amp;P 500 futures contract was down 0.90 point to 713.55 on Globex at 1052 GMT. The December 30-year Treasury bond futures contract was flat at 111-2/32.</p>
