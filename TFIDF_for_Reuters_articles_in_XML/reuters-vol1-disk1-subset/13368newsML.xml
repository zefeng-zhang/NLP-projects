<p>The condition of Mother Teresa, in hospital with a weakening heart, has improved slightly, a spokeswoman for the 85-year-old Nobel peace laureate's Missionaries of Charity order said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The doctors say her general condition has improved slightly although she is not out of danger,&quot; Sister Priscilla told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Sister Priscilla gave no further details.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa was taken to hospital on Tuesday with a high fever and severe vomiting. She later suffered heart failure before responding to treatment.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, a doctor at Woodlands Nursing Home, the hospital where Mother Teresa was being treated, said the missionary's condition had not changed appreciably.</p>
<p>Her heart problem was under control but she still needed respiratory support, the doctor said. She had a low-grade fever and was not allowed visitors, he added.</p>
