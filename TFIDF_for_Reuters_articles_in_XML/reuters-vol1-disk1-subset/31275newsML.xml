<p>Pan American World Airways said Wednesday it planned to resume flying this month following a merger agreement that will provide key financing for the airline.</p>
<p>Panam said Frost Hanna Mergers Group Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., agreed to merge with Pan Am and create Pan Am Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We would expect to consummate the merger and be in the air this month,&quot; it said. &quot;Frost Hanna's involvement provides Pan Am with an additional $10 million in cash and is a key part of the $40 million financing we have raised to launch a serious, high quality airline.&quot;</p>
<p>Pan Am and Frost Hanna had announced the proposed merger in January.</p>
<p>Pan Am said the new entity would likely become a publicly traded company listed on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The airline, temporarily headquartered in Miami, said it would begin service with A300 Airbus wide-bodied aircraft with daily flights serving New York, Miami and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It would later add San Francisco, Chicago and San Juan during the first year of operation, it said.</p>
<p>The previous Pan Am, one of the world's aviation pioneers, collapsed in 1991 under heavy debts.</p>
<p>Two years later, Florida businessmen Chuck Cobb and Martin Shugrue bought its name and logo with the intent of eventually resurrecting the airline.</p>
