<title>UK: Devil imagery in soft drink ad too scary for kids.</title>

<p>An ad for a British soft drink depicting a boy with horns and glowing eyes drew complaints from viewers who linked it to devil imagery too disturbing for children, the industry watchdog said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Independent Television Commission (ITC), which licenses and regulates Britain's commercial TV, said it had restricted the television ad for the fizzy drink Irn Bru by allowing it to be shown only late at night, after the ITC received 57 complaints.</p>
<p>The ITC's move underscores growing public concern about the use of demonic images in advertising. Many condemn such 'shock tactic' ads for the distress they can cause to children.</p>
<p>The ruling Conservative Party's controversial campaign this month -- featuring Opposition leader Tony Blair with red, satanic eyes -- is being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates press and poster ads.</p>
<p>Broadcasts of a Nike footwear ad last month, which showed a football match between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; teams and included a bat-eared devil with yellow eyes, were restricted to late evenings after viewers complained that it would harm children.</p>
<p>The Irn Bru soft drink ad was originally banned from being shown during children's programmes by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC), the body which vets ads for the ITC.</p>
<p>But the ad was inadvertently aired before the broadcasting &quot;watershed&quot; time of 9.00 p.m. because of a technical error, the ITC said.</p>
<p>The ad was created for Irn Bru by advertising agency The Leith Agency.</p>
