<title>UK: South Korea advertising market grows 15 percent.</title>
<headline>South Korea advertising market grows 15 percent.</headline>

<p>The South Korean advertising market is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the country's economy, rising 14 percent in 1995, according to a report released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The South Korean advertising market generated revenues of $5.94 billion in 1995, making it the sixth largest ad market in the world and second only to Japan in the Asia Pacific region, Zenith Media, the media buying and planning arm of Cordiant Plc , said in its report &quot;Television in Asia Pacific to 2001&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;As the government loosens its grip on the economic life of South Korea, advertisers, particularly foreign multinationals, are afforded new opportunities to enter the advertising market,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Television accounted for 28 percent of the advertising expenditure in 1995, and its proportion is expected to rise further as the South Korean television market is deregulated.</p>
<p>Television advertising expenditure in 1995 totalled $1.7 billion, a 15 percent rise over 1994. The expenditure, in constant 1995 prices, is expected to rise 14 percent in 1996 to $1.9 billion and reach $4.1 billion in 2001, Zenith said.</p>
<p>South Korea's population of 44.5 million includes 11.4 million households with televisions, or 99 percent of all homes. Viewers watch an average of 161 minutes of television a day.</p>
<p>The state-controlled Korean Broadcasting Advertising Corp (KOBACO) currently sells all the airtime for Korea's two terrestrial commercial networks, sets the cost of airtime, and limits the two networks to two, 90-second advertising slots per hour.</p>
<p>The networks currently are allowed to broadcast 14 hours a day during the week and 19 hours a day on the weekends. The government is expected to allow 24-hour broadcasting in 1997, and KOBACO is thought likely to lose its monopoly on terrestrial airtime sales by the end of the decade, Zenith reported.</p>
<p>&quot;A deregulated market supplying larger amounts of airtime should attract a greater share of advertising budgets, fueling rapid growth in television adspend in the last years of the decade,&quot; Zenith said.</p>
<p>Cable television, which debuted in South Korea in March 1995, continues to command only a very small proportion of the population.</p>
<p>Of South Korea's 11.4 million homes with televisions, only 800,000 had been connected to cable as of July 1996 and, of those, only 260,000 households were actually subscribers. The other 540,000 homes were receiving cable on a free trial basis.</p>
<p>Cable channels may air up to six minutes per hour of advertising, which they sell independently of KOBACO. Advertisers, however, have yet to leap at the cable market due to its low penetration rate and poor programming environment.</p>
