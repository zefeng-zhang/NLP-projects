<p>A package designed to look like a fertiliser bomb shut down all train traffic -- including Amtrak passenger trains on the main eastern seaboard route -- through Newark's Penn Station for about a half hour early on Monday night, police and railroad officials said.</p>
<p>A 5:05 p.m. (2105 GMT) call received by the Amtrak reservation centre in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, said that a bomb was on the Northeast Corridor train that was scheduled to depart New York's Pennsylvania Station at 5:15 p.m. (2115 GMT), said Amtrak spokeswoman Maureen Garrity.</p>
<p>The caller did not provide a reason for the bomb, she said.</p>
<p>The information did not reach the train until after it left the station, she said. Train personnel stopped the train at Hudson train yard, which is 8.6 miles (13.8 kms) outside of New York, she said.</p>
<p>After they realised they could not safely remove passengers there, they drove the train to the next station, Newark Penn Station, she said.</p>
<p>At Newark Penn Station passengers were put on other Amtrak or New Jersey Transit local trains, she said. Police pulled the train nearly out of the station, but left one door adjacent to the platform so that searchers could board the train, she said.</p>
<p>Police, aided by bomb-sniffing dogs, found a box containing fertiliser in an electrical locker in the second car of the train, she said.</p>
<p>It was made to look like a bomb, but it definitely was not a bomb, she said.</p>
<p>After police found the package, they shut down train lines for 26 minutes while X-raying the package, she said. Port Authority police said the station was closed for about a half an hour.</p>
<p>After the box was found to contain only fertiliser the line was re-opened at 7:06 p.m. (2306 GMT), Garrity said.</p>
