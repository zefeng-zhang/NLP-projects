<p>Indonesian cigarette company PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna continued to surge on Tuesday following a news report that it would sell its 2.85 percent stake in car maker Astra International, brokers said.</p>
<p>It had risen 500 rupiah, or 2.47 percent, to 20,750 rupiah on a volume of 485,000 shares by 0500 GMT after rising to 21,000 rupiah in early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The news has given a positive sentiment to the stock but the upside appears to be limited as many investors are waiting for further disclosure of its investment in Astra and the purpose of its $400 million loan,&quot; said one foreign broker.  </p>
<p>Another foreign broker said many investors were interested in buying-back Sampoerna shares as the firm was considered to have good fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent news that Sampoerna had increased the retail price of its cigarettes also helped to improve sentiment in the stock but players are buying only limited amounts,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brokers said the cancellation of Sampoerna's shareholders' meeting scheduled for November 2 had also boosted sentiment.</p>
<p>They said there had been speculation the meeting would have discussed the possible purchase of more Astra shares by Sampoerna, which recently secured a $400 million short-term bank loan.</p>
<p>Sampoerna had said the money would go towards &quot;corporate development&quot; but did not give details.</p>
