<title>UK: NWE gas oil slips, weather/supply shaves premiums.</title>
<headline>NWE gas oil slips, weather/supply shaves premiums.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil fell on easier futures on Tuesday and premiums for Russian heating oil and winter grade diesel weakened on more supply and balmy weather, traders said.</p>
<p>Nov IPE ended $3.50 lower at $230.75, depressed by news that Colonial pipeline said it had received a surge in heating oil orders for the next 40 days and by mild European autmun weather.</p>
<p>A cargo of lower suphur diesel winter grade (-7/-22) was traded at Nov IPE +26.50 cif NWE for prompt delivery, about $4 lower than Monday, shaving the differential to heating oil to around $20 from around $24 and $25 last week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's kind of a disaster (for sellers). It must be just the weather, because stocks are still low,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Low sulphur (diesel) is definitely less tight than before... refineries are catching up on production,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>On the barge market, traders reported a parcel of intermediate grade (-3/-13) traded for Nov IPE +$35, unchanged to slightly firmer than on Monday. A parcel of prompt refinery grade heating oil was traded for Nov IPE +2, unchanged.</p>
<p>Barge traders said more supply made buyers hard to find and predicted premiums for both heating oil and diesel would weaken.</p>
