<p>Magna Group Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Homeland Bankshares Corp., the second-largest banking company in Iowa, for about $216 million, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Magna will issue 5,038,934 shares of its common stock and $91,966,970 in cash in exchange for all the outstanding Homeland common shares. Homeland shareholders may choose to exchange each of their shares for either about 1.55 Magna shares, a comparable amount in cash or a combination.</p>
<p>Homeland's stock rose 50 cents to $34.50, while Magna edged down 25 cents to $24.625 early on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Waterloo, Iowa-based Homeland, with assets of $1.20 billion as of June 30, owns and operates four commercial banks and one savings bank and provides financial services through a network of 33 locations in Iowa.</p>
<p>St. Louis-based Magna Group, with $5.35 billion in assets, is the third-largest banking institution in the St. Louis metropolitan area and the nation's 95th largest banking company. It has 106 banking locations throughout Illinois and Missouri and a trust and brokerage company.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to approval by Homeland shareholders and regulators.</p>
<p>Magna said it expects the acquisition to boost earnings within 12 months, and save about $8 million through centralization of systems and procedures.</p>
