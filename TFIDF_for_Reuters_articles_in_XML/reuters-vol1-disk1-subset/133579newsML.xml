<p>French President Jacques Chirac has had a difficult Israel visit, but his reception in self-rule areas, where he will become the first foreign head of state to address the Palestinian legislature, promises to be warm.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's peace envoy Dennis Ross meanwhile on Tuesday reversed plans to leave PLO-Israel talks on a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron, citing progress.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said Ross would assess again on Wednesday whether to stay or return to Washington, based on negotiations that went through Tuesday night into early Wednesday.</p>
<p>In what commentators said was a sign talks were getting down to business on thorny security aspects of the partial withdrawal, Israel's army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Amnon Shahak, and top PLO official Abu Mazen, also known as Mahmoud Abbas, joined the talks at a Jerusalem hotel.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologised on Tuesday after Israeli security men jostled Chirac and manhandled journalists as he toured the Old City of Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A red-faced Chirac, teeth clenched and elbows flailing, had demanded that they leave him in peace to greet Palestinians and visit Christian, Moslem and Jewish holy sites.</p>
<p>&quot;This is provocation. Stop this now. Do you want me to go back to my plane and go home to France?&quot; Chirac protested in English to the head of security. His request was ignored.</p>
<p>Netanyahu explained security had become an obsession since the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin nearly a year ago by an extreme-right Jew. Chirac said that in the light of the apology, he regarded the incident as closed.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, Chirac takes leave of Israel and goes to the West Bank Palestinian self-rule enclave of Ramallah where he is to address the Palestinian legislative council, elected in January under interim PLO-Israel peace deals.</p>
<p>His public support on his Israel visit for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state and emphasis of the longstanding international refusal to recognise the Israeli annexation of Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 will ease his way in Palestinian areas.</p>
<p>Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and vows never to give up an inch of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israeli resentment flared when Chirac visited the Israeli parliament later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two far-right members walked out, one shouting &quot;antisemite&quot;. Knesset speaker Dan Tichon said in a barbed welcome speech: &quot;We have disagreements with you, Mr President. The things you say are not always music to the ears of all the citizens of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>As Chirac waged his Israel visit, Washington's Ross waded back into the PLO-Israel negotiating fray.</p>
<p>&quot;We delayed our departure last night because we were in the midst of the most promising discussions to date on the issue of civil affairs,&quot; Ross said in a statement.</p>
<p>But violence erupted. Witnesses said Israeli soldiers shot dead an Arab during a stone-throwing protest in the West Bank. The army said troops fired in the air and it was investigating.</p>
<p>The shooting near Ramallah followed the killing of an Arab motorist near a Jewish settlement in unclear circumstances.</p>
<p>The Hebron talks were decided on at a Washington summit called after 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed in West Bank and Gaza clashes last month.</p>
<p>Palestinians view whether the redeployment, set for last March, is implemented as a test of Netanyahu's commitment to peace deals signed by the government he ousted in May elections.</p>
