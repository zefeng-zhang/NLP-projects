<p>Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed, who brokered a peace deal with Chechen separatist leaders last week, will fly to the rebel region on Thursday for more talks, Lebed's spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He did not give any details of the trip, which comes after Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin clearly backed the agreement signed by Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov to end the 21-month war which killed tens of thousands.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, who ordered Lebed to restore peace in Chechnya, has so far kept silent about the deal reached on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lebed and Maskhadov agreed to defer for five years a decision on whether Chechnya should become independent -- the heart of the conflict started in December 1994 when Moscow sent troops to quell the region's three-year independence bid.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's top aide, Anatoly Chubais, said on Wednesday he was likely to meet Lebed later in the day to discuss Chechnya.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who disappeared from public in late June and is now vacationing outside Moscow, has not seen Lebed since he had named the former paratroop general his personal representative in Chechnya more than three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Ekho Moskvy radio station said Chubais also met the head of the pro-Moscow authority in Chechnya, Doku Zavgayev, who has been sidelined in the deal reached between Lebed and Maskhadov.</p>
<p>Zavgayev has accused Lebed of staging an effective coup d'etat and encouraging the separatists to grab full power in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Ekho Moskvy, quoting Chubais' spokesman, gave no details of the meeting with Zavgayev.</p>
