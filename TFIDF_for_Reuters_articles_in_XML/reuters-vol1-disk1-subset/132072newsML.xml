<headline>Burmese general urges people to crush traitors.</headline>

<p>One of Burma's most powerful generals has urged patriotic Burmese to crush &quot;axe-handles&quot; or traitors who are spreading Western ideals throughout the country, official media reported on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to urge all those who love the nation to crush axe-handles who are acting to the liking of neo-colonialists and spreading Western ideals for domination of western culture,&quot; state-run media quoted military intelligence chief, Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, as saying.</p>
<p>Khin Nyunt, who is also Secretary One of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), made the remarks in a speech.</p>
<p>Burmese officials have repeatedly called democracy leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi an &quot;axe handle&quot; and accused her of colluding with Western nations, especially the United States, to create instability and unrest in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Neo-colonialism today has its way of breeding their cohorts in a country they want to get under their influence and try to dominate it with their cultural ways,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today too, it is found that there are stooges and axe handles reared by neo-colonialists trying to dim and obliterate Myanmar culture, traditions and customs to enslave Myanmar people again, not only just to make the world look down on Myanmar,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Myanmar is what the SLORC renamed Burma after it seized power in 1988.</p>
<p>Roadblocks manned by heavily-armed security police barring access to Suu Kyi's street remained in place on Monday for the 10th consecutive day.</p>
<p>The government has said it set up the barricades to prevent unrest.</p>
<p>The blockades, which were also in place from September 26 to October 8 to stop Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party (NLD) from holding a party congress in late September, prevented Suu Kyi from holding regular weekend speeches to supporters for the fourth weekend in a row.</p>
<p>The government also arrested 573 democracy activists in late September but later released them in stages.</p>
