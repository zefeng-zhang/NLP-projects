<p>A South Korean court sentenced former president Chun Doo Hwan to death on Monday on charges of masterminding a 1979 coup and an army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators the following year.</p>
<p>His presidential successor, Roh Tae-woo, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison for playing a supporting role.</p>
<p>Both men were army generals during the putsch, which thrust Chun to power. The army massacre in the southern city of Kwangju killed about 200 civilians by official count and crushed democratic opposition to Chun's martial law rule.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel said Roh was spared the death sentence in recognition of his role in gaining South Korea entry into the United Nations in 1991 and his other diplomatic achievements.</p>
<p>Both were found guilty of taking bribes. Chun was fined 225.9 billion won ($276 million) and Roh 283.8 billion won, equal to the amount they were convicted of pocketing.</p>
<p>Chun's rise to power &quot;cannot be justified as it was obtained through illegal means which inflicted enormous damage on the people&quot;, according to the judges' verdict.</p>
<p>Referring to the Kwangju massacre, it accused the defendants of &quot;putting down popular resistance to clear the way for their rise to power&quot;.</p>
<p>Chun and Roh are expected to appeal the sentences handed down by the Seoul District Criminal Court after what was dubbed South Korea's &quot;trial of the century.&quot;</p>
<p>Many Koreans are convinced that current President Kim Young-sam, whose campaign to &quot;right the wrongs of history&quot; prompted the legal action, will offer them pardons.</p>
<p>The two have remained defiant, defending the coup as needed to prevent turmoil following the assassination of president Park Chung-hee.</p>
<p>The court also passed judgment on 14 former military cronies of Chun and Roh. One was cleared of charges relating to Chun's grab for power while the other 13 were sentenced to jail terms of four to 10 years.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, nine business tycoons and nine former officials were to be sentenced on bribery charges. Among the moguls are the chairmen of the mighty Samsung and Daewoo groups.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, women relatives of the Kwangju victims attacked Roh's son, Jae-hun, as he left the court and shouted &quot;Kill the murderer's son.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier the women, dressed in white mourning garb, cheered when news of the death sentence reached them. Some burst into tears when they heard Roh had escaped capital punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Hand over all the slaughterers to us and we will finish them off, as they killed our children,&quot; sobbed one old woman.</p>
<p>Chun and Roh, former military academy classmates, arrived in court dressed in pale blue prison pyjamas. They briefly squeezed hands as they took their places in the defendants' box.</p>
<p>Their administrations spanned 13 years from 1980-1993 during which South Korea traversed a path to democracy and built a world-class economy.</p>
<p>In a society where &quot;face&quot; is everything, their downfall has been spectacular. Part of a ruling elite of tough officers who emerged from the barracks to orchestrate the country's military-style economic charge, they are now despised.</p>
<p>The trial is being closely watched by other young Asian democracies struggling to lay to rest the ghosts of past military excesses.</p>
<p>Chun gained respect for his rigid defiance of court proceedings. A protest hunger strike in his detention cell brought him to the brink of death.</p>
<p>But public thirst for vengence waned as evidence mounted that not just the star defendants but almost every leading politician and tycoon in the nation were tainted by corruption.</p>
<p>Visceral anger against Chun and Roh is confined mainly to Kwangju and surrounding South Cholla province. The two former presidents still enjoy support in their home provinces, a factor President Kim must weigh as he seeks backing for a candidate of his choice to contest presidential elections next year.</p>
