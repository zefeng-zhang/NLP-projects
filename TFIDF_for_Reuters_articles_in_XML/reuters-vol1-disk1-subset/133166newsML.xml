<p>Lithuania's Vytautas Landsbergis celebrated a political comeback on Tuesday, but analysts say he may have to learn to tone down a confrontational style in his comments on Russia and the West.</p>
<p>The 64-year-old former music professor and leader of Lithuania's 1990-91 struggle for independence savoured victory after his Homeland Union Party unseated the ex-communists in a weekend election, sweet revenge for a defeat in 1992.</p>
<p>The victory may leave the way open in two years time for Landsbergis to challenge his old rival, Algirdas Brazauskas, for the presidency of the Baltic state.</p>
<p>But with a new order and new challenges in Europe analysts say Landsbergis will have to curb any instinctive anti-Moscow impulses.</p>
<p>Landsbergis so infuriated former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that Gorbachev refused to call him by his name, referring to him only as &quot;that musician.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats said Landsbergis' natural sentiments may in the end be tempered by the weight of duty.</p>
<p>&quot;He will find that the responsibilies of government will be a disincentive to annoying Russia,&quot; said one Western diplomat.</p>
<p>Landsbergis often accused Russia of imperialism and anti-democratic tendencies, airing a mistrust of Lithuania's huge neighbour which many Balts share.</p>
<p>This was in contrast to the outgoing Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP) administration, which worked pragmatically to sooth the wounds of past struggles and solved the issue of Russia's access to its Kaliningrad enclave, southwest of Lithuania.</p>
<p>It was also under LDLP rule that Russian troops quit Lithuania in 1993, a full year before leaving Lithuania's neighbours Latvia and Estonia.</p>
<p>But with Lithuania now bidding for NATO membership, analysts say he will need to put aside confrontation and work for warmer ties with Moscow.</p>
<p>NATO, which is trying to forge a new relationship with Russia, expects any eastern Europe leader aspiring to alliance membership to abandon anti-Russian sentiment before entry, western diplomats say.</p>
<p>Landsbergis often criticised the LDLP government for taking too soft a line with NATO and the European Union and advocated a more forceful, pro-active policy.</p>
<p>Lithuania is bidding to be a full member of NATO and is on the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme but is unlikely to enter in a first wave of expansion. It is also an associate member of the EU.</p>
<p>Diplomats said that what the West understood and appreciated most was thoughtful and well worked out policy.</p>
<p>&quot;What impresses the West is not table thumping but policy papers and serious thought,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;The challenge will be to deliver the structures so you don't just have the laws that are in line with the EU but you can enforce them as well,&quot; the diplomat added.</p>
