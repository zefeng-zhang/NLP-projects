<headline>RTRS-AWB Report-Australian wheat in weather watch.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wheat growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) were watching the developing weather pattern nervously, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said in its weekly report on Monday.</p>
<p>Early deliveries of wheat in central Queensland were not showing the degree of rain damage that many had expected but &quot;it's early days yet&quot;, AWB said. There may be more seriously damaged wheat to be delivered, it said.</p>
<p>Harvest began in Western Australia in the week just ended.  </p>
<p>Feed grain prices generally firmed about A$2.00-A$3.00 during the week but there was no consistent trend to milling wheat prices.</p>
<p>In Victoria and Queensland, the bids for premium grades firmed by about A$2.00 a tonne but fell by A$3.00 a tonne in NSW, it said.</p>
<p>There was a very big reaction to the jump in soy bean prices throughout the oilseed complex and the AWB's bid for canola dropped by A$30.00 a tonne during the week.</p>
<p>The AWB's wheat indicator price fell by A$6.00 to A$144.75 a tonne delivered Newcastle over the past week.  </p>
<p>The price is that at which the AWB will strike a multigrade contract and represents a daily snapshot of the whole cross section of international customers.</p>
<p>The AWB has held its estimate of the 1996/97 crop at 20 million tonnes.</p>
<p>On the international market, the AWB said some activity occurred in the cash marklet in the past week with sales confirmed to Algeria, Morocco, Jordan and Japan.  </p>
<p>Argentine wheat continues to be the most aggressively priced in the market and sales of 150,000 tonnes to Jordan were recorded at A$208.00 a tonne and 25,000 tonnes to Algeria at A$214.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Turkey is a rumoured buyer of 200,000 tonnes of Argentine wheat. Algeria paid A$214.00 a tonne for 100,000 tonnes of French wheat. Japan bought 20,000 tonnes of Australian Prime Hard and 20,000 tonnes of Australian Standard White wheat as well as U.S. and Canadian wheat, it said.</p>
<p>Exports of U.S. wheat continue at levels above those necessary for that country to reach its export target, AWB said.</p>
