<p>European stocks faded on Tuesday as investors took profits after Wall Street's rally faltered, while the dollar lost ground against the mark.</p>
<p>The London, Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges all fell during the morning, with London slipping from Monday's record close.</p>
<p>News that Tokyo prosecutors had arrested Sumitomo Corp's former top copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, on charges he falsified documents in connection with the largest ever financial scandal had little impact on London metal prices.</p>
<p>The prosecutors' office said Sumitomo had filed formal legal charges against Hamanaka, who it blamed for a massive $2.6 billion loss from unauthorised copper trades.</p>
<p>Precious metals prices climbed higher in a bullish mood in early trading, extending gains posted on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold broke out of its $378-$382 range and the market is very bullish,&quot; a dealer said. Bullion fixed at $382.40 an ounce, compared with a London close on Monday of $381.75.</p>
<p>Europe's equity markets took their lead from Wall Street and Tokyo, where the the Nikkei also ended 0.8 percent down.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average settled 3.36 points lower at 6,090.87 on Monday after lurching along in fits and starts as investors reacted to IBM's third-quarter results.</p>
<p>Profit-taking pushed British shares back from Monday's record finish after disappointment over Wall Street saw prices edge steadily lower through the morning.</p>
<p>News of a special dividend payout from foods and household products group Reckitt &amp; Coleman and a merger of Cable &amp; Wireless's British operations with Nynex CableComms and Bell Cablemedia provided bright spots in otherwise subdued trading.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing a pause in proceedings as a little bit of profit-taking sets in. We'll probably see a run up in shares ahead of Christmas but there are concerns about inflation and a possible rise in interest rates. We are at levels where you can fidget people into being sellers,&quot; said one senior trader.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index, which hit a new closing best of 4,073.1 on Monday, was 13 points down at 4,060 by 1115 GMT.</p>
<p>German shares also traded lower but were off their lows by mid-session, with the 30-share DAX index showing a loss of nearly seven points at 2,721.</p>
<p>Traders said the bourse was weighed down by losses on Wall Street and predicted the market would consolidate this week.</p>
<p>Utility stock RWE was weaker despite saying it was confident of reporting higher profits in its 1996/97 business year.</p>
<p>French stocks were marginally lower by midsession but off their lows as the market continued to digest last week's rally.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 2.47 points or 0.11 percent at 2,177.75 at 1115 GMT, while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at down 3.0 at 2,184.0 from Monday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little consolidation and profit-taking tied to the dollar and a steady New York,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The dollar extended its retreat from 4-1/2-month highs against the mark, traders blaming a combination of changing sentiment, profit-taking, softer oil prices and Deutsche Telekom's share sale next month.</p>
<p>Losses were limited to 1.53 marks, however, as players assessed whether recent dollar strength had run its course or was just building strength for a fresh push higher.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that some of the recent forex moves were overcooked and a lot of trend-followers, who are always first to go when momentum stalls, have pulled positions,&quot; said Peter Von Maydell, senior currency economist at UBS in London.</p>
<p>The British pound set 13-month high against dollar at $1.5958 during the morning and bounced back against the mark after dropping below 2.44 marks.</p>
<p>By mid-session, however, sterling had pegged back its gains to $1.5948 and 2.4465 marks</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1115 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5343 marks and 112.70 yen, compared with Monday's London close of 1.5357 marks and 112.72 yen .</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 1115 GMT</p>
<p>London - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 13.1 points at 4,060.</p>
<p>Paris - The CAC-40 share index was down 2.47 points at 2,177.75.</p>
<p>Frankfurt - The 30-share DAX index was off 6.79 points at 2,72s2.24.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed stronger at $382.40 against $381.00 on Monday afternoon and $380.00 in the morning. Silver rose two cents to $4.96.</p>
