<title>FRANCE: Algerian forces kill 20 Moslem rebels.</title>

<p>Algerian security forces killed 14 Moslem rebels in a gunbattle in Algiers and another six rebels died in raids in and outside the capital, Algerian newspapers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Algiers mayor Ali Boucetta was killed during the 14-hour gunbattle on Monday when a stray bullet pierced his heart as he peered out his window in Telemely, a middle-class Algiers district, Liberte and El Watan newspapers reported.</p>
<p>Security forces stormed a rebel hidout on Sunday night, setting off the clash as guerrillas fled and took refuge in a building a few blocks away, where the two sides battled through the next day.</p>
<p>El Watan said security forces also killed six Moslem guerrillas in two operations carried out Algiers's Beau Fraisier suburb and in Kolea, 30 km (20 miles) west of Algiers.</p>
<p>Ali Boucetta, like almost all other mayors, was named by the authorities to replace Moslem militant mayors sacked four years ago after their radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party was outlawed in 1992.</p>
<p>The authorities accused militant mayors of turning most of Algeria's 1,500 townhalls into a &quot;spider's web&quot; for lending logistics support for the then nascent Moslem guerrilla.</p>
<p>The FIS swept to the top most of the North African country's townhalls and councils, particulary in main cities, in local elections in 1990.</p>
<p>Moslem guerrillas have killed more than 200 appointed mayors and local officials since 1993.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people have died in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities scrapped a general election in which the FIS had taken a commanding lead.</p>
