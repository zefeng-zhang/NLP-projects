<p>U.S. broadcaster NBC, which launched with Microsoft the MSNBC cable TV and online news and information service in July, said on Tuesday it  expected the channel to make its debut in Europe in late 1997.</p>
<p>The venture plans to develop sufficient European programme content and distribution before launching in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;In late '97 we would intend to launch,&quot; Roger Ogden, president and managing director of NBC Europe, told a news conference.</p>
<p>While developing European programming is a key issue in launching the channel in Europe, the most crucial hurdle is ensuring sufficient distribution.</p>
<p>&quot;Analogue distribution is very tight,&quot; Odgen told Reuters after the news conference. &quot;Existing distributors are struggling to stay on. It's a very difficult time to launch a new channel.&quot;</p>
<p>The development in Europe of digital TV, which allows a far greater number of channels to be transmitted via a single transponder, will open opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the key to the launch,&quot; said Ogden. &quot;We think the early stages of distribution will be slow,&quot; he added. &quot;We'd like to have at least four or five million homes at launch.&quot;</p>
<p>Two programmes from MSNBC will be broadcast in Europe this autumn on the NBC Super Channel -- &quot;Internight&quot;, a television talkshow with an interactive twist, and &quot;The Site&quot;, which offers news on new technology and the information revolution.</p>
<p>The NBC Super Channel, which is broadcast to nearly 70 million homes in 44 countries across Europe via cable and satellite, has changed greatly since NBC bought the London-based Super Channel in 1993.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue for NBC Europe has more than doubled over the last year and is expected to grow 80 to 100 percent over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be in the 80 to 100 percent range,&quot; Odgen told Reuters. He said advertising revenue had more than doubled over the past year and continued to be the channel's most important source of income.</p>
