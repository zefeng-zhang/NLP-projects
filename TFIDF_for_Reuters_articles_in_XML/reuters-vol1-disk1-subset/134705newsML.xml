<p>Istanbul shares fell sharply in consolidation on Tuesday after the recent sharp gains, but recovered slightly on fresh support, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100  .ISEC ended at 81,504.41, down 1,796.55 points, or 2.16 percent from Monday's all-time high close of 83,300.96. It brushed a low of 81,160 before rebounding on late reaction buys.</p>
<p>Trade volume plunged to 17.30 trillion lira from Monday's record high 28.83 trillion lira.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's profit-taking was a normal technical development which may continue tomorrow. If the index falls through 81,500 it may touch 78,000 levels before turning up again,&quot; said Murat Emrali from Eczacibasi securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales accelerated in the afternoon which may create downward pressure at the opening tomorrow,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brokers expect selective demand to be fuelled by nine-month profit prospects. Companies have to announce their nine-month financial statements by October 25 the latest and banks by November 8.</p>
<p>The index had surged 28.6 percent from September 13 to Monday, breaking nine record closes in the strong medium-term uptrend which began with the breaching of 65,000 barrier.</p>
<p>Of the 226 shares traded, losers outdid gainers by 150 to 45 and 31 ended steady. The 85-share industrial index  .ISEI fell 2.2 percent to 85,864.51 while the 15-share financial index .ISEF dropped 2.06 percent to 79,386.59.</p>
<p>Actives were led by utilities -- Aktas Elektrik, steady at 81,000 lira, Cukurova Elektrik, down 2,000 lira at 73,000 and its associate Kepez Elektrik, down 3,000 lira at 89,000.</p>
