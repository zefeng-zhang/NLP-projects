<p>Canadian spot natural gas prices continued their across-the-board rise in brisk trade on Wednesday, with British Columbia markets leading the way amid high California demand and tight supply, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Any gas that can go west is going west,&quot; said a harried Calgary-based trader.</p>
<p>Most players in the B.C. market, which until last week was the site of rock-bottom prices for well over a year, said they were not shocked at current levels, but surprised by how quickly prices ran up over the past week.  </p>
<p>Gas for export at the Huntington/Sumas export border on the west coast was quoted as high as US$1.96 per million British thermal units, a dramatic 64-cent jump from last week. Gas at Westcoast Energy's Compressor Station 2 was quoted as high as C$2 per gigajoule, up nearly 60 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;There's another cold front predicted (for the West Coast) next week, so I don't see much downside from here,&quot; said a Vancouver-based trader.</p>
<p>AECO gas was also pushed up thanks to western demand, marketers said. Gas at the Alberta storage hub was discussed at C$1.42/1.44 per GJ, up a dime from last week. November gas was fetching C#$1.41 up by as high as five cents. -- Reuters Calgary Bureau 403 531-1624</p>
