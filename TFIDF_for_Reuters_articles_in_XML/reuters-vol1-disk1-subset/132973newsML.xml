<p>Russia is expected to start investor presentations for its long-awaited debut Eurobond in mid-November, investment bankers in London said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some bankers said they had heard Russia would probably conduct a roadshow in London on November 14.</p>
<p>The bond, which bankers currently expect to be a five-year issue of as much as $500 million, has been talked about in the Euromarket for months. Joint lead managers are J.P. Morgan and SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, a Russian finance ministry official told Reuters in Moscow the country planned to issue its first Eurobond in November and would soon start a roadshow in major financial centres.</p>
<p>Vladimir Dmitriyev, deputy head of the ministry's foreign credit department, said November was the most likely time for the Eurobond issue as markets would be closed for much of December for the Christmas and New Year holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;But for us it is not necessary to launch the bond at any price this year, but to choose the right time for it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Previously government officials had said the Eurobond would be launched at the end of October or start of November.</p>
<p>Last month Russia received better-than-expected credit ratings, paving the way for the Eurobond issue.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service gave Russia a Ba2 rating while Standard &amp; Poor's Corp assigned it a BB minus and IBCA rated it BB plus.</p>
