<headline>OPTIONS - Bund vol decent halted as rate hopes fade.</headline>

<p>Implied volatility levels on Bund options rose late on Wednesday as hopes of any further German interest rate cuts faded, trader said.</p>
<p>They said vol levels had been relatively subdues earlier in the session, before Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing told German television there was no reason to expect further reduction in key German interest rates, saying the German economy was performing better than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of a panic, everyone was a bit nervous anyway, especially as you get locals on the back of it trying trigger stops,&quot; said a trader on the LIFFE floor.</p>
<p>Brokers quoted volatility levels for December at 4.96 to 5.05 percent compared with 4.70 percent earlier in the session and 4.80 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>For March implied vol had also risen to around 4.97 to 5.04 percent from 4.95 percent earlier and 4.99 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility will go down but has been temporariliy halted,&quot; said Luke White, broker at Fimat Futures UK in London. &quot;Locals were hunting for stops around the 99.80/85 level yesterday. There are big stop levels around the 99.85 level and definitely at the 99.95 level.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People are not being overly aggressive but would like to sell vol on the December,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At 1456 GMT the underlying December Bund future was at 99.54, down 27 basis points on the day, having touched 99.85 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>November serial options are due to expire on Thursday and White said investors would not want to start selling the 99.50 straddle because it would be seriously in-the-money if the stops around 99.90 came off and the underlying future went up.</p>
<p>&quot;If they're short of the money at the 99.50 straddle they're not going to be very happy so that is why they stopped,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said normally the strike with the highest level of open interest was the thing to watch for because Bunds would tend to stay around that strike during the expiry window -- a period of an hour and a half towards the middle of the session.</p>
