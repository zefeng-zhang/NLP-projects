<p>China is stepping up its struggle against tax cheats and fradulent expense accounts with new receipts that will make forgeries more difficult, official media said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The State General Administration of Taxation would start requiring businesses to install computer equipment to issue value-added tax (VAT) receipts for transactions over 100,000 yuan, the Business Weekly said.</p>
<p>The computer system has been used since January for receipts of more than one million yuan and this has made forgeries more difficult, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China had lost billions of yuan in tax revenue to forged receipts since a new tax code was adopted in 1994, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's VAT is 17 percent.</p>
<p>Tax authorities would also issue a new style of receipt for smaller transactions using anti-forgery markings. It has also ordered inspections of printing shops to try to crack down on counterfeiting of receipts, the Economic Information Daily said.</p>
<p>The new receipts would be used nationwide from January next year, the newspaper said without giving further details.</p>
<p>Many officials and businessmen inflate their expense accounts by buying forged receipts. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
