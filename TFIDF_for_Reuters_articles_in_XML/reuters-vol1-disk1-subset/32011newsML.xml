<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat shook hands for the first time on Wednesday promising to pursue Middle East peace together.</p>
<p>The meeting marked the right-wing Israeli leader's formal acceptance of Arafat as a negotiating partner three years after the former guerrilla chief sealed a peace deal with a historic handshake with Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn.</p>
<p>But their hour-long summit at the Israel-Gaza border began awkwardly with a brief handshake too quick to photograph and did not resolve a major obstacle delaying the implementation of Palestinian autonomy --  the date and scope of Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will meet Arafat on Sunday to tackle that issue and discuss Israel's six-month-old closure of the West Bank and Gaza, Netanyahu said in Tel Aviv after the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;The next day, we will convene the (Israeli-Palestinian) steering committees for the first official meeting and we will begin the discussions,&quot; the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Although short on substance the meeting and handshake were seen as vital symbols of both sides' commitment to the stalled Oslo peace agreement.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had delayed meeting Arafat, whom he used to brand a &quot;terrorist&quot;, citing security concerns. But the Likud prime minister came under strong pressure from the United States, co-sponsor of Middle East peace efforts, to meet the PLO chairman. Netanyahu visits Washington next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that we will work with Mr Bibi (Netanyahu) and his government to push the peace process, the peace of the brave,&quot; Arafat said at a post-summit news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Both parties reiterate their commitment to the interim agreement and their determination to carry out its implementation,&quot; Netanyahu said, referring to self-rule deals between the previous Israeli government and the PLO.</p>
<p>But he told the news conference: &quot;We have to take into account the needs and requirements of both sides on the basis of reciprocity and the assurance of the security and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinians alike.&quot;</p>
<p>By security, Netanyahu means protection for the 400 Jewish settlers living among more than 100,000 Arabs in Hebron and changes to the troop redeployment set in a 1995 agreement with the PLO.</p>
<p>&quot;We made it clear that with all our good intentions to carry out the agreement, a security underpinning must be added to allow the Jewish population in Hebron to live as normal and safe a life as possible,&quot; Netanyahu said in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Arafat appeared to be content with the victory Palestinian officials said he achieved by getting a reluctant Netanyahu to meet him, and gave a muted response when asked at the news conference about the Hebron issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I have nothing to add but to state that we will continue to negotiate and to coordinate all efforts, by all means,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;The road is paved for the negotiations between us on all aspects and at every level, including the final-status talks, of course,&quot; he said. But Palestinian officials said from their perspective the talks were on implementation rather than changing previous accords.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, with the help of Terje Larsen, a U.N. official and Norwegian middleman who helped broker the original Oslo self-rule accord in 1993, struggled in the past week to find a formula for a summit and peace talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's agreement to meet Arafat followed some tough talk and strident action from the Palestinian leader.</p>
<p>Arafat said last week's Israeli decision to expand Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza and its policy on Jerusalem were tantamount to declaring war on the Palestinians.</p>
<p>He also called a four-hour general strike in the two areas last Thursday, the first such stoppage in two years.</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Arafat started the meeting at the Israel-Gaza border with a quick handshake that caught photographers off-guard.</p>
<p>They shook hands again -- this time for four seconds -- as cameras clicked but ignored shouted appeals from photographers at the end of their news conference for another replay.</p>
<p>The meeting followed four days of intensive talks to fix a summit seen as vital to reviving peace talks suspended since Islamic suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
