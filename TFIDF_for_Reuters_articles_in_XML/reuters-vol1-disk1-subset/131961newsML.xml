<p>Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk opened a new parliamentary session on Monday with attacks on rampant deforestation and the continuing plunder of his Asian nation's cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Sihanouk, opening the seventh ordinary session of the 120-member national assembly, appeared to link deforestation to recent floods that killed more than 20 people, left hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed thousands of hectares of rice.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the unsatisfactory outcome of efforts to halt thefts of archaeological treasures from the pre-Angkorian and Angkorian Khmer eras.</p>
<p>&quot;Our struggle against deforestation, as well as that against the plunder of the pre-Angkorian and Angkorian Khmer archaeological treasures, has not produced, until this day, a satisfactory outcome,&quot; he told assembled MPs and diplomats.</p>
<p>The government acknowledges problems with deforestation and the theft of treasures from temples of the great Angkor civilisation (9th-15th Centuries) and earlier eras, but denies involvement in, or encouragement of, either problem.</p>
<p>The king said the national solidarity manifested during the floods, &quot;Assuages our pain caused by so many misfortunes inflicted by nature and also by those who are responsible for the deforestation and its manifold disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Environmentalists say Cambodia's forest cover has shrunk from 70 percent of the territory in the late 1960s to less than 40 percent today, with tree-felling soaring in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The government banned fresh cutting and exports of logs this year but environmental groups say the bans are being circumvented.</p>
<p>The government has set up a special force around the Angkor temples in the northwest to tackle thieves. Earlier this month, the Thai government returned 13 valuable artefacts of the Angkor and pre-Angkorian era that were seized in Bangkok.</p>
<p>MPs said the three-month session of parliament would address several draft laws, but added that the legislation for general elections scheduled for 1998 was not on the agenda.</p>
<p>Most MPs, including co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, attended the opening session in white tunics and traditional trousers.</p>
