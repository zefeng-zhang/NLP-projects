<p>Former Spanish premier Felipe Gonzalez and his one-time Portuguese counterpart Anibal Cavaco Silva said on Monday the decision on who joins monetary union would be made on political and not just economic grounds.</p>
<p>The two men have two decades of European Union politics between them.</p>
<p>&quot;There is going to be a political decision,&quot; Gonzalez told a one-day conference on Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;That does not mean that the interpretation (of the economic rules) will be lax. But in the end, it will be the trend...rather than the exact numbers that count,&quot; said the Socialist leader who lost elections last March after 13 years in power.</p>
<p>The 15-nation European Union has set a series of economic entry qualifications for membership of the single currency and government leaders will meet in the spring of 1998 to decide which countries meet them.</p>
<p>Both Spain and Portugal have made significant steps towards fulfilling the requirements, which include limits on budget deficits, but the issue of how strictly the criteria will be applied remains the subject of fierce debate within the Union.</p>
<p>Echoing the former Spanish leader, Cavaco Silva said that the decision, based officially on a country's economic performance in 1997, would have &quot;a strong political component.&quot;</p>
<p>The Social Democrat, whose party was defeated in parliamentary elections just over a year ago, warned that by taking too severe a line on who qualified, the EU risked putting the block under intense strain.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be desirable if all, or nearly all (aspiring members) passed to the final phase (of monetary union),&quot; said Cavaco Silva, who was making his first appearance in a public forum since losing presidential elections last January.</p>
<p>&quot;The project of monetary union needs at least a dozen...starting with fewer would be a big risk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cavaco Silva said that failure to qualify could weaken political support for the ideal of the EU, particularly if the spurned country felt the decision were politically and economically unfair.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said that it would be absurd for a country to be ruled out of contention just because its budget deficit was a shade over target, providing that it had been moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it (will happen),&quot; he said, adding that he felt freer to speak about such issues since leaving government.</p>
