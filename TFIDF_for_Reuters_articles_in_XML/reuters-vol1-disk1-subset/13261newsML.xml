<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda wants Israel's Likud government to adhere to the land-for-peace formula to advance Middle East peace talks, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;In Israel we will be underscoring what we have been saying about the need for further progress on implementing agreements reached so far on the principle of land-for-peace and relevant U.N. resolutions,&quot; a Japanese spokesman told reporters after talks between Ikeda and Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti.</p>
<p>Arabs have condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for refusing to exchange occupied Arab lands for peace, a principle endorsed by his predecessor Shimon Peres and the basis of the peace talks since 1991.</p>
<p>Ikeda arrived in Amman on Saturday on the third leg of a regional tour after Egypt and Syria to boost bilateral ties and discuss the stalled Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>He is due to visit Palestinian self-ruled areas and Israel to meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli officials before heading to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Japan was committed to advancing Palestinian-Israeli talks, suspended since the victory in May elections of the hardline Netanyahu, the Japanese spokesman quoted Ikeda as saying.</p>
<p>Israel has given no date for a long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron. Palestinians see the move, agreed by Israel's previous government last September, as a test of Netanyahu's intentions.</p>
<p>Netayahu has also lifted restrictions on more Jewish settlement of occupied land and has done little to ease a ban on Palestinians working in Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge the Palestinian-Israeli track should be advanced and the redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron and the resumption of final status talks as soon as possible and an immediate lifting of the closure and urge restraint by the Israelis on the issue of settlements,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ikeda and Kabariti signed an accord for a $7 million grant for Jordan to modernise the northern border crossing with Israel to help trade.</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesman said Ikeda told Kabariti that Jordan's request for extra balance of payments support could only be considered within the context of multilateral agreements with other donors.</p>
<p>Japan's soft loans and grants to Jordan in the last year have totalled $340 million, including $215 million in balance of payment support and a $100 million loan to expand Jordan's largest power plant in Aqaba.</p>
