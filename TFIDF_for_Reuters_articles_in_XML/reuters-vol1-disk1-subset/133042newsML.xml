<p>Nearly 10,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees fled a camp near the eastern Zairean town of Bukavu on Tuesday for fear of being attacked by Tutsi rebels fighting Zairean troops further south, a U.N. spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Bukavu with 22 camps for Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees with a total population of 307,000 people, had so far been unaffected by the chaos in Uvira, 100 km (65 miles) to the south, where the fighting sparked an exodus of 221,000 refugees -- with some fleeing towards Bukavu.</p>
<p>Michelle Quintaglie, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Programme in Kenya, told Reuters a total of 9,950 refugees fled Nyangezi camp in Bukavu.</p>
<p>Quintaglie said there were indications that refugees from neighbouring camps were also taking to the road in Bukavu, the provincial capital of south Kivu.</p>
<p>&quot;Nyangezi is the southern-most refugee camp in Bukavu. It is therefore natural that the camp should be affected. The refugees are fleeing because of fears they would be attacked by rebels,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Hutu refugees are likely to seek shelter in surrounding hills, rather than return to nearby Rwanda which they fled in 1994 fearing reprisals for the genocide led by extremist Hutus of hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis.</p>
<p>Zaire's ragged army is battling Banyamulenge rebels - an ethnic Tutsi group which came to Zaire from Rwanda at the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>The fighting has fuelled fears that the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry which triggered the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the equally bitter civil war in Burundi could engulf the whole Central African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>Zaire accuses neighbouring Rwanda, controlled by a Tutsi-dominated military, of supporting the Banyamulenge. Kigali denies the charge.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the United Nations evacuated 48 aid workers from Uvira, where they have been trapped in fighting between the Zairean army and the Banyamulenge.</p>
<p>&quot;They had been held up for three days in aid agency compounds due to heavy fighting in the area,&quot; a spokesman for the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said.</p>
<p>He also warned that humanitarian aid workers would not return until the security situation had improved.</p>
<p>WFP has been providing emergency food rations to all refugees in the 12 camps in Uvira.</p>
<p>The food agency warned that supplies for refugees in south Kivu were running out.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have enough food to feed them. We are left with six days of food supply. We are facing a catastrophe. The future is bleak,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
