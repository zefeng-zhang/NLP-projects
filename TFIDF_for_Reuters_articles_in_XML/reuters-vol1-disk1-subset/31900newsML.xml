<p>Asian crude prices softened on Wednesday along with a dip seen on Brent and NYMEX futures which were said to have been overbought, but concerns over the Middle East crisis persisted, traders said.</p>
<p>An analyst said the market has already seen the emotional reaction to the U.S. attack on Iraq and traders now have time to observe the true facts of the matter. The November Brent/Dubai spread was offered at $2.20 while the Dubai intermonth spreads were steady at 43/46 cents for Oct/Nov and 42/46 cents for Nov/Dec. Yemen decided to roll-over the price of Masila crude to maintain it at dated Brent minus 45 cents.  </p>
<p>Following this, Masila term lifters in Japan, S.Korea and others in Asia said they were prepared to cease fourth-quarter contracts if prices were not lowered. Marib light price for the fourth quarter was also rolled-over at dated Brent flat. Oman raised the price of August-lifting crude by 83 cents a barrel to $19.60 from July's $18.77, traders said.</p>
<p>Despite initial uncertainties over its crude purchases after the price spike amid the U.S. attack, China's Sinochem was said to have bought 150,000 barrels of September lifting Minas crude at ICP minus 22 cents a barrel. Another 200,000 barrels of Minas was bought by a Japanese refiner at ICP plus 28 cents.  </p>
<p>Traders said China needed to buy September Minas as they did not want to see cargoes moved to the west and dry up Asian supplies. They said if West Texas Intermediate crudes remained over $23, it would be attractive to move Minas to the U.S. as seen in August. About 1.0 million barrels of Minas and another million barrels of Bontang and Attaka were moved to the U.S. in August. Tapis prices slipped on buyers concerns with high sale premiums of 70 cents. Traders said the shutdown of Australia's Jabiru field from mid-September to end-November would remove 25,000 bpd from the light sweet market.--Ramthan Hussain, Singapore, (+65 870 3084), J.
