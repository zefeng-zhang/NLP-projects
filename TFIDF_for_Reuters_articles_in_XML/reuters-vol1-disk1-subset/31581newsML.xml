<p>Bulgaria's Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a green light to the opposition presidential candidacy Petar Stoyanov after the Central Electoral Committee (CEC) refused to register him due to legal inconsistencies.</p>
<p>&quot;The Supreme Court accepted the claim of the Union of Democratic Forces against CEC's decision...and ruled to register the team Stoyanov and Kavaldjiev as candidates in the presidential election,&quot; a court official told reporters.</p>
<p>Petar Stoyanov, a lawyer who beat incumbent President Zhelyu Zhelev in Europe's first primary election in June, has had difficulty having his application papers signed after one of the opposition coalition of parties backing him, sacked its leader.</p>
<p>The court decided to acknowledge the coalition with the Agrarian Party as legitimate. Stoyanov is flanked by Todor Kavaldjiev as vice-presidential nominee from the Agrarian Party.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is final and cannot be appealed,&quot; said the court official.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday the ruling Socialists named culture minister Ivan Marazov as their new presidential candidate, after the Supreme Court blocked the candidacy of foreign minister Georgi Pirinski, on the grounds that he was born in the United States.</p>
<p>The constitutional court ruled in July that the president must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth.</p>
<p>Marazov, 54, had been Pirinski's vice-presidential candidate in the campaign for the October 27 polls. He was nominated during a night meeting of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) high council, composed largely of former communists.</p>
