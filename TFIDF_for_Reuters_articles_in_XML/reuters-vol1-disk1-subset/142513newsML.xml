<p>A riot involving around 500 angry fans of CSKA Moscow overshadowed the penultimate round of matches in the Russian league on Friday.</p>
<p>There were reports of more than 55 injuries after CSKA supporters battled with police after watching their team lose 3-1 at home to lowly Chernomorets Novorossisk. Police were forced to fire into the air in a bid to restore order, RIA news agency and a Moscow television station said.</p>
<p>The riot was the latest in a series of violent incidents to mar soccer games in Russia, where until recently hooliganism was almost unheard of.</p>
<p>The violence in the town of Selyatino, some 50 km (35 miles) south of Moscow, distracted attention away from defending champions Alania Vladikavkaz, who moved to the top of the league with one game to go.</p>
<p>Alania, who have trailed Spartak Moscow and outsiders Rotor Volgograd for much of the season, won 2-0 at already relegated Tekstilshchik Kamyshin while Spartak needed an 85th minute goal to secure a 1-1 home draw against mid-table Rostselmash Rostov.</p>
<p>Both sides are now on 69 points but Bakhva Tedeyev's goals in the 37th and 87th minutes put Alania top because they have one more win. Alania look to have the easiest remaining fixture on November 3 when they play Lokomotiv Nizhny Novgorod at home.</p>
<p>Spartak face a difficult away tie at Zenit St Petersburg, whose coach Pavel Sadyrin detests the Moscow side and inspired his team to a fine 2-0 away win over them in July.</p>
<p>Rotor, who before last weekend's games headed the 18-team premier division, stumbled again by losing 2-0 at Lokomotiv Moscow and stay on 67 points, dropping to third place.</p>
<p>They face struggling Uralmash Yekaterinburg next week but can only win the title in the unlikely case of both Spartak and Alania losing.</p>
