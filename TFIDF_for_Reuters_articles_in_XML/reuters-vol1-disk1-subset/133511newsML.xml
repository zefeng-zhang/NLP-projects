<p>The chairman of South Korea's sprawling Daewoo Group was summoned by Seoul prosecutors on Tuesday in connection with an arms scandal involving a former defence minister, a Daewoo spokesman said.</p>
<p>Yoon Young-suk, who is also chief executive officer of Daewoo Heavy Industries, returned on Tuesday morning from an overseas business trip, spokesman Kim Yoon-shik said.</p>
<p>Kim emphatically denied any wrongdoing by the company, one of South Korea's leading business conglomerates.</p>
<p>South Korea's main opposition party has alleged an arms dealer was paid bribes of 300 million won ($362,000) by Daewoo Heavy last year to arrange a government purchase of military helicopters.</p>
<p>The dealer paid half the money to former defence minister Lee Yang-ho, who was sacked last week by President Kim Young-sam, according to the allegations made in parliament by the National Congress for New Politics.</p>
<p>Lee Yang-ho has denied the accusations, according to domestic media reports.</p>
<p>The Daewoo spokesman said Daewoo Heavy had paid money to the arms dealer, but not as a bribe.</p>
<p>&quot;The amount did not exceed 300 million won. But it was a commission and not bribery. We have been framed by this fake. That's all we can say at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time, Yoon was chairman of Daewoo Heavy, a leading government arms contractor. Currently, Yoon is in day-to-day charge of the Daewoo group while its powerful founder, Kim Woo-choong, focuses his attention on running its auto division.</p>
<p>Prosecutors denied all comment on the case.</p>
<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam has ordered an investigation into the scandal.</p>
<p>The affair has embarrassed the president, who has staked his reputation on rooting out corruption in high places in a campaign that has led to the trial and conviction of former presidents Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.</p>
<p>Daewoo founder Kim Woo-choong is currently appealing a two-year jail sentence imposed for bribing Roh. He was one of nine businessmen convicted on similar charges.</p>
<p>The latest scandal has also cast a further pall over a military already reeling from criticism over its failure to intercept a North Korean submarine that intruded last month.</p>
<p>Lee was removed as part of a sweeping reshuffle of the military top brass. The changes were portrayed as a move to shake up a military heirachy accused by politicians and the media of becoming lax and complacent.</p>
<p>The National Congress also accused Lee of leaking classified information on military purchasing plans to the Korean-American arms dealer, Kwon Pyong-ho.</p>
<p>And it alleged he bought expensive jewellery for Roh's daughter on behalf of Lee to secure a promotion for Lee earlier in his career.</p>
<p>Lee Yang-ho has not commented in public on the charges. State media have reported he has been barred from leaving the country.</p>
<p>The submarine ran aground off South Korea's east coast city of Kangnung on September 18. The military was alerted by a taxi driver who saw it looming out of the darkness.</p>
<p>The 26 North Koreans on board fled to the mountains where 22 have been killed or found dead and one captured. A hunt is underway for the three others.</p>
<p>Former President Chun was sentenced to death and Roh to 22-1/2 years in jail after being convicted in August on charges of corruption, mutiny and treason. Both men are currently appealing their convictions.</p>
