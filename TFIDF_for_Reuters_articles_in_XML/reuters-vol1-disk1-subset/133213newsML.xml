<p>The Polish zloty drifted upward against the basket of currencies in light trade on Tuesday as some banks reacted to the dollar's recent fall on world markets by buying zlotys, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the zloty tracked dollar/mark swings in European trade for most of the session but said some bought the Polish currency as zloty deposits remained more attractive than those held in western currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally the market trailed dollar/mark moves but some acted on the dollar's recent fall and bought zlotys,&quot; said Katarzyna Solarz, forex dealer at Pekao SA.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 1.91/1.86 percent from the trading band centre, stronger than Monday's close at 1.85/1.79 percent.</p>
<p>It finished at 2.8261/76 per dollar, up from 2.8305/20 on Monday and at 1.8418/27 to the mark, down from 1.8395/10.</p>
<p>One-day deposit rates rose as monthly tax payments evaprorated the market's liquidity on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight rates closed at 19.10/19.30 percent, up from this morning's 19.85/19.10. Tomorrow/next rates were at 19.15/19.45 percent, also up from 18.70/19.10 despite the central bank's decision not to stage a reverse-repo auction on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>On the secondary T-bill market yields inched up in line with Monday's primary tender. Dealers said 52-week paper bought on Monday with an average yield of 19.46 percent was quoted at 19.47/42 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The treasury sold 183 million zlotys of its three year floating bond, maturing November 6, 1999, after investors bid to buy 373 million zlotys at the 600 million zloty tender.</p>
<p>The treasury cut minimum price of the three-year bond to 100.0 from 100.6 and the average price to 100.37 from 101.21 at the last auction on July 23.</p>
