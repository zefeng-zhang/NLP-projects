<headline>Former HK judge declares bid for post-97 chief.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior former Hong Kong judge announced on Tuesday he would bid to become leader of the territory when the British leave next year.</p>
<p>Former Appeal Court Judge Simon Li called a news conference for Wednesday and said he would outline his plans then.</p>
<p>His very brief written statement gave no further details.</p>
<p>Li is the sixth prominent Hong Kong citizen to make a bid for the job of Chief Executive to take over the helm from Governor Chris Patten when the British colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30, 1997, a date now 252 days away.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's outgoing chief justice Sir Ti Liang Yang, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, and businessman, Peter Woo, have also declared an interest in the job.</p>
<p>Two self-declared candidates, a solicitor and another former High Court judge, withdrew their bids last week.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader will be picked by a Beijing-controlled 400-strong selection board chosen by the Preparatory Committee responsible for overseeing the transition of Hong Kong from British colony to Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR).</p>
<p>Both Li and Tung are Preparatory Committee vice chairmen.</p>
