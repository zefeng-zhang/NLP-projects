<p>Oct 21 SETTLEment  prev settlement</p>
<p> TIFFE Euroyen 3M (M)     99.21		   99.14</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The key June three-month Euroyen deposit rate futures contract on TIFFE ended the day session higher on Monday, tracking the key December Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract, which soared in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Euroyen futures were up early in the day on short-covering after Sunday's general elections. They received a further boost in the afternoon following a jump in JGB futures,&quot; said a trader at a Japanese city bank.  </p>
<p>The December JGB futures contract soared in afternoon trading, due largely to the unwinding of short JGB positions and long Nikkei 225 futures which were taken by foreign speculators last week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The June Euroyen contract was squeezed higher after breaking key technical resistance of around 99.17. For a while, it is likely to be susceptible to movements in Tokyo stocks, JGBs and the yen,&quot; said another city bank trader. Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita's various remarks about the economy at the opening of the BOJ branch managers' meeting were virtually ignored, traders said.  </p>
<p>Matsushita said that the monetary policy will continue to emphasise making Japan's recovery more solid.</p>
<p>In the interbank call market, the key unsecured overnight rate was trading at 0.48 percent, up from 0.47 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Although the BOJ maintained a neutral stance in this morning's money market operations, demand for funds was strong due to a shortfall caused by an increase in bank note issues, traders said. The key three month certificates of deposit rate was at 0.52 percent, unchanged from Friday. Turnover was 30 billion yen.</p>
