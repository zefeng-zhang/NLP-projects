<headline>Iraq Kurds dig in for hill defence against rivals.</headline>
<dateline>HEIBET SULTAN, Iraq 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Kurdish guerrillas prepared defensive positions on a hill in northern Iraq on Tuesday in readiness for a counter attack by rival forces towards the region's capital Arbil, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) fighters set up mortar and machinegun posts on the steep 500-metre (1,500-feet) Heibet Sultan hill to fend off advancing Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) forces.</p>
<p>&quot;We know from their wireless communications that they are ready to attack so we are preparing a defence,&quot; local KDP commander Hassan Balamarani told Reuters.</p>
<p>The PUK, led by Jalal Talabani, beat off a KDP attack on the strategic Dukan Dam on Monday in fighting that defied U.S. attempts at ending the conflict.</p>
<p>Some of Barzani's fighters, looking weary, were walking the 35-km (20-mile) back to the hill from Dukan.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of deaths at Dukan, including civilians,&quot; Balamarani said. He did not say how many people been killed.</p>
<p>Barzani, accompanied by a convoy of around 30 vehicles, spent an hour inspecting his forces encamped at Heibet Sultan, overlooking a main road to Arbil. He refused to speak to journalists.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Robert Pelletreau was due to meet Talabani in Turkey on Tuesday after talks with Barzani on Monday on a U.S. bid to end the fighting.</p>
<p>Iraq condemned the U.S. efforts and said it was trying to end the inter-Kurdish fighting itself.</p>
<p>Barzani, who joined Iraqi troops to take Arbil from the PUK in August, accuses Talabani of receiving men and munitions from Iran. Tehran and the PUK deny this.</p>
