<p>A Florida pilot whose light plane developed engine trouble on Tuesday landed it on the roof of a supermarket and was able to walk away unhurt, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Raymond McClelland suffered only a minor cut on his knee and no one else was hurt but the airplane was destroyed and the store roof was damaged.</p>
<p>McClelland, 52, of Venice, Florida, was trying to reach a Venice airport when the single-engine Cessna lost oil pressure. He crash-landed the plane on the Publix supermarket roof about a mile (1.6 km) short of the runway, police said.</p>
<p>Sarasota Sheriff's Department spokesman Cpl. Tim Carney said the plane skidded across the roof and hit the inside of a three-foot (metre)-high parapet around it. &quot;He may have chosen the roof of a Publix supermarket because it was a large open space with no pedestrians,&quot; Carney said.</p>
<p>A shopper was treated for minor breathing problems after the store was hastily evacuated when fuel leaked onto the roof.</p>
