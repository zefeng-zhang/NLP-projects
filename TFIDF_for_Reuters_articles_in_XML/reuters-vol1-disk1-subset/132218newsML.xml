<headline>PRESS DIGEST - Denmark - Oct 21.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--- New local authority computer programmes are revealing large numbers of Danes claiming inflated allowances in their income tax returns. Numbers detected were 57 percent higher in 1995 than in the previous year.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--- A new survey made by Vilstrup Research shows that most voters do not believe that Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will be able to fulfill his pledge to bring warring motorcycle gangs under control.</p>
<p>--- A Chamber of Commerce survey shows that 44 percent of 145 companies surveyed do not consider political or human rights conditions when deciding whether to trade with or invest in a foreign country. Seventy-five percent of the companies did not think they would respond to media campaigns urging them to boycott a particular country because of its political or human rights conditions.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS POSTEN</p>
<p>--- Danish companies miss many export sales opportunities because of excessive morality and uncreative thinking, the Danish Confederation of Industry says.</p>
<p>While opposing kickbacks, it says there are grey areas where a more flexible attitude can save time and money. Taking over an existing telephone line and paying off the subscriber's outstanding bill, for example, or &quot;tipping&quot; customs officials at some frontiers where a four or five-day wait is otherwise not uncommon.</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--- Environmental consequences of the expansion of Copenhagen airport have now been submitted to an official hearing and airline companies are expected to raise objections to future noise limits. However 50 percent more landings and take offs in 2005 are expected to make less noise, due to quieter aircraft types.</p>
