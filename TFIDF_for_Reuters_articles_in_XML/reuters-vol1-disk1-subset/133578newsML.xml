<p>Yemen on Tuesday arrested 18 members of a tribe that kidnapped a French diplomat in the capital Sanaa, security sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Security authorities arrested 18 members of the al-Toaiman tribe to put pressure on the abductors,&quot; a security official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the arrests were made in Marib, a few in Sanaa.&quot;</p>
<p>Security officials said on Monday the diplomat was abducted while he was driving his car in Sanaa and taken to the province of Marib, 170 km (100 miles) north of the capital.</p>
<p>But later the officials said they were still trying to determine where he was being held.</p>
<p>The deputy governor of Marib, Yahya Shayef, said the tribe was seeking government compensation for losses inflicted on homes, farms, water pumps and wells from the impoverished Arab state's worst floods in June.</p>
<p>More than 65 people were believed killed, dozens went missing and hundreds were made homeless in the floods that caused damage estimated at more than $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;They are demanding financial compensation for these losses,&quot; Shayef told Reuters. &quot;Negotiations with the tribe are continuing, every once in a while, and we are using flexibility and self-restraint with them to maintain his safety.&quot;</p>
<p>Shayef said police and army forces, using light and heavy weapons, were keeping a tight lid on the tribe's al-Mahjaza village.</p>
<p>(Corrects name of village).</p>
<p>Officials said the diplomat's car had been spotted in Marib by local police before they were informed of his abduction.</p>
<p>No details were available on the identity of the diplomat.</p>
<p>The Toaiman tribe earlier this month hijacked the car of Yemen's minister of agriculture and kidnapped his driver in Sanaa. The minister was not in the car at the time. The driver was beaten up and later set free.</p>
<p>The tribe demanded then that the government provide it with water pumps and drilling equipment for wells in Marib.</p>
<p>In recent years, tribes in Yemen with grievances against the government or foreign oil firms have kidnapped tourists or foreigners for use as bargaining chips.</p>
<p>At least two diplomats, an American and a Saudi ambassador, have been among the kidnap victims.</p>
<p>The tribes' demands have usually involved land or water issues, and have rarely been political. There have been no reported casualties from the abductions.</p>
<p>In January, members of a tribe kidnapped 17 elderly French tourists in Marib who were later released.</p>
