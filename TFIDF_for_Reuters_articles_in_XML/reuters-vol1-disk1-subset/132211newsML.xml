<p>Israel and the PLO have decided to continue informal talks on a Hebron redeployment and to delay resumption of formal talks that should have opened in Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat on Monday, an Israeli spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Saeb Erekat and Dan Shomron decided at the end of the talks in the early morning hours that the talks will continue without going down to Eilat,&quot; Israeli delegation spokesman Moshe Fogel told Reuters on Monday referring to PLO team leader Erekat and Israeli chief negotiator Shomron.  </p>
<p>Israel Radio said the decision was made when negotiators realised there were tougher problems on civil affairs issues relating to the partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron than had first been thought.</p>
<p>Fogel said: &quot;I think you have to see it in this context: the security parts of the redeployment are at a somewhat more advanced stage than civil affairs aspects but I don't think it has anything to do with going down to Eilat.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel's previous government signed a deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation a year ago that included the Hebron redeployment. The redeployment, set for March, was delayed after Islamic suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who took office in June, put the partial withdrawal on hold demanding changes to enhance security for some 400 Jewish settlers living amid 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron. Palestinians say there can be no substantive changes to the signed deal.</p>
