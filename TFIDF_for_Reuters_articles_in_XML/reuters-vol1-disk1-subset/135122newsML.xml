<headline>RTRS-AGL eyeing Tenneco's Australia assets.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian Gas Light Co's (AGL) managing director Len Bleasel said AGL is interested in acquiring some of the Australian assets of Tenneco Inc..  </p>
<p>&quot;We are interested in a number of their assets,&quot; Bleasel told reporters after the company's annual meeting.</p>
<p>The company was more interested in Tenneco's Australian assets than in joint ventures the U.S. energy group has in Indonesia, he said.</p>
<p>But he added that the company would be interested in the Indonesian assets if they were sold with the Australian assets.</p>
<p>Tenneco has announced a planned restructuring that includes a proposed merger of El Paso Energy Corp with Tenneco's Energy unit.  </p>
<p>Bleasel said AGL was mainly interested in Tenneco's pipeline businesses in Australia. Tenneco operates the 1700 km of pipeline in South Australia including the state's primary gas pipeline from Moomba to the Adelaide pipeline system.</p>
<p>Tenneco is currently building a 760 km gas pipeline in southwest Queensland. The U.S. group has formed a joint venture in Indonesia with Australia's Energy Equity Corp Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not really interested in the Indonesian joint ventures, but it depends on how the assets are sold,&quot; Bleasel said. He added AGL had made it known to Tenneco that it was interested in its Australian assets.  </p>
<p>Bleasel said the company had been in talks were parties that were acting as brokers to the sale of Tenneco's local assets.</p>
<p>He could not disclose whether the company was close to forming a deal with Tenneco or related parties.</p>
<p>At 1.15 p.m. (0315 GMT), AGL shares were 13 cents or 1.97 percent higher at A$6.73.</p>
