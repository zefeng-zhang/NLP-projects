<p>Indian soymeal exporters have sold 575,000 tonnes of soymeal but offtake was limited due to a fall in demand in foreign markets, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said soymeal yellow was quoted at $255 fas (free alongside ship) for November shipments compared to $292-293 in mid-September.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian soymeal prices may further decrease due to weak domestic and international market,&quot; said Prakash Mutha, a senior official of the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA).</p>
<p>Mutha said soybean arrivals were expected to increase in the central Indian markets after limited arrivals during the past two days due to a Hindu festival.</p>
<p>Till last week traders had signed contracts for sale of 550,000 tonnes of soymeal.</p>
<p>On Tuesday new soybean of around 1,000 tonnes had arrived in the markets in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>Traders said contracts were being signed for November, December and January shipments with main buyers from Singapore and Germany.</p>
<p>Soybean was quoted at around 9,600-10,150 rupees per tonne in the domestic markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices of soybean, soymeal and soyoil may further decrease because availability of soybean will increase at the end of the week,&quot; said Prakash Vohra, a trader.</p>
