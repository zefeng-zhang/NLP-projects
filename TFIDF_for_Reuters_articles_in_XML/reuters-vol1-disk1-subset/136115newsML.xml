<p>Advanta Corp said on Wednesday that its Advanta National Bank USA and Advanta National Bank subsidiaries, priced a $500 million credit card securitization transaction.</p>
<p>The closing was set for November 1, Advanta said.  </p>
<p>The Series 1996-E securitization consisted of three classes of uncapped floating-rate certificates issued by Advanta Credit Card Master Trust II, the company said.</p>
<p>The senior class A certificates, representing $432.5 million in receivables, would have an expected average life of about five years, it said. The Class A coupon rate would be reset monthly and would equal one-month LIBOR plus 10 basis points, the company said.</p>
<p>The $27.5 million in subordinated Class B Certificates would have an average life of about 5.1 years, carry a coupon reset monthly and equal one-month LIBOR plus 33 basis points.  </p>
<p>The Class A certificates were priced at a discount of 99.959 percent, while the Class B certificates were priced at par, the company said. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co is the lead underwriter, it said.</p>
<p>In addition to the publicly offered certificates, a $40 million interest in Master Trust II, which would be subordinated to and provide credit enhancement for both the Class A and Class B certificates, would be sold in a private placement, Advanta said.</p>
