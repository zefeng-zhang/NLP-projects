<title>RUSSIA: Rouble firm on arbitrage, ahead T-bill sales.</title>
<headline>Rouble firm on arbitrage, ahead T-bill sales.</headline>

<p>The rouble was stable against the dollar but overnight credit rates firmed ahead of Wednesday's government bond auctions and on arbitrage operations, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Roubles are scarce ahead of the auctions, this is why the dollar is not rising at the moment,&quot; Moscow Business World Bank dealer Nikolai Zolotaryov said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday October 23, the central bank is auctioning eight trillion roubles of six-month GKO T-bills and 2.5 trillion roubles of two-year OFZ bonds.</p>
<p>Another dealer said relatively high overnight rates had made it attractive to carry out a swap, selling dollars for today settlement and buying them back for tomorrow settlement, while investing the rouble proceeds on the overnight credit market.</p>
<p>Roubles for today settlement were quoted at 5.431-34 per dollar, the same as in early trading. They were at 5.434-36 late on Monday. Tomorrow roubles were unchanged from yesterday's late 5.437-40 per dollar.</p>
<p>The central bank said it had set 5.435/5.445 as its bid and offer rates against the dollar on Monday.</p>
<p>Overnight rouble credits yielded 40-50 percent compared with Monday's late 20-30 percent.</p>
