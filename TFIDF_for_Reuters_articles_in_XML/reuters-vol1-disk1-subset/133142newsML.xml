<p>Russia, signalling a big crackdown on tax dodgers, plans to start bankruptcy proceedings against four companies that owe large sums to the federal budget, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin told Interfax news agency the decision to get tough was &quot;final, but until tomorrow there is still time for them to take the steps to pay off their debts to the budget.&quot; He said the four firms would be named on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Presidential chief of staff Anatoly Chubais said &quot;punitive measures,&quot; possibly legal action, would be taken against those officials guilty of undermining budget revenues, Interfax reported.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Russian companies are technically insolvent, but bankruptcy proceedings have been launched only rarely and enterprises usually stay in business due to the high social cost of closing them down.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin gave no details of what the practical impact of the latest crackdown might be, but it could result in company restructurings or management shakeups.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday Chernomyrdin chaired a meeting of a recently created special tax commission and said urgent measures were needed to improve budget revenues in a reference to Russia's woeful tax collection performance.</p>
<p>The shortfall in revenues has deprived the state of funds to pay salaries and fund investment.</p>
<p>Interfax also quoted Chernomyrdin as saying two officials of the state customs committee had been fired over &quot;an unfounded decision on the granting of customs privileges.&quot; Their names were not given.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin also delivered &quot;stern warnings&quot; to finance minister Alexander Livshits and the head of the state tax service Vitaly Artyukhov about the need to boost revenues, Interfax reported.</p>
