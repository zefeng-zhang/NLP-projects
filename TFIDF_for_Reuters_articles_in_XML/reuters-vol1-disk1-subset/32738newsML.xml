<title>USA: U.S. debt futures erode to close lower, off lows.</title>
<headline>U.S. debt futures erode to close lower, off lows.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. debt futures steadily eroded most of the afternoon, barely cutting losses into the clsoe but still finishing lower.</p>
<p>Traders said order flows remained thin, however, a condition that some expected to persist until Friday's August U.S. employment figures.</p>
<p>December Treasury bond futures shaved losses late as some shorts covered when downside lacked followthrough despite the contract's breach of support pegged at near 106-24/32.</p>
<p>&quot;Day-traders were short, hoping for more downside...below 106-25/32,&quot; said one floor broker in U.S. T-bond futures.  </p>
<p>The inability of December T-bond futures to mount any sustained recovery on Wednesday fostered perceptions among some brokers that prices would head lower into Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The price action was pretty bad,&quot; the broker added. &quot;There was not much of a bounce. I think it was a bad close. I'm going with the camp that we're going down into Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's more of a reversal of yesterday's emotion,&quot; said another floor broker of Wednesday's pullback. &quot;But you've got to keep in mind we've been eroding since the opening bell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're just retracing some gains from yesterday,&quot; added a third broker.  </p>
<p>The first broker pegged the next line of support at the 106-16/32, with a zone of support spanning the 106-02/32 to 10/32 area.</p>
<p>On the upside, the contract during the morning proved unable to scale 107-20/32, with traders noting good selling from the outset.</p>
<p>&quot;Sellers were very happy with the higher open,&quot; added the first broker. &quot;They were selling out of the box...and we never saw those (higher price) levels again.&quot;</p>
<p>Reports of explosions and anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad initially added more weight after midday, traders said.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, debt futures initially had sagged as crude oil rallied and fanned inflation fears after news of the first U.S. missile attack against Iraq military targets.</p>
<p>But debt futures reacted little early on Wednesday to news the United States had launched the second round of missiles against targets in southern Iraq that had not been destroyed in Tuesday's operation.  </p>
<p>Futures already had weakened on Wednesday when BTM/Schroders chain store sales for the week ended August 31 jumped 1.3 percent. Some traders said they had heard talk before the futures market opened that the sales figure would be strong.</p>
<p>News of a bigger-than-expected, 1.4-percent drop in July U.S. construction spending, however, had little impact.</p>
<p>December T-bonds ended down 13/32 at 106-31/32, T-notes fell 6/32 to 105-19/32, muni-bonds fell 20/32 to 111-10/32, Eurodollars lost four bps to 93.87, and T-bills gave up four bps to 94.47. --Derivatives Desk 312-408-8750 E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
