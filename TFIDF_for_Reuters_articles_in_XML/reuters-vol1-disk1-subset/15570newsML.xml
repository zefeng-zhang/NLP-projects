<p>Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between 60 and 70 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman, authorities said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association, called Mr Sadiki, and that police were trying to trace him.  </p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Kim White said police had already contacted Sadiki and were trying to arrange to bring him to Stansted, 30 miles (48 km) north-east of London, to talk to the hijackers.</p>
<p>The airport spokesman said the six hijackers, who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives, were believed to be Iraqi nationals.</p>
<p>The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 10, starting with women and children, in what police described as a &quot;controlled release&quot;.</p>
<p>Police said most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis, Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis. Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80.</p>
