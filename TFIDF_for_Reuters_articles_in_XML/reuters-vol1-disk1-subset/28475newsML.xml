<headline>FOCUS-Rate fears, Iraq crisis hit Euro/U.S. shares.</headline>

<p>Fears of higher interest rates and news of U.S. missile attacks on Iraq conspired to rattle Wall Street and European stock markets on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But news that a key U.S. economic indicator turned out weaker than expected took some pressure off stock and bond markets by mid-afternoon in Europe.</p>
<p>The U.S. retaliation for weekend incursions by Iraqi troops into Kurdish areas stoked up the oil market. However, oil prices later eased well below post-Gulf War peaks hit in Asian trading.</p>
<p>Gold and the dollar, often safe havens for funds at times of crisis, also slipped from earlier highs, although the U.S. currency stayed quite buoyant against the yen in view of Japan's dependence on imported oil.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks lost more than 50 points within 10 minutes of Wall Street's opening, the first time the key New York share market had traded this week and could react to the renewed tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton said he ordered missile strikes on Iraqi targets to punish Saddam Hussein for attacking Kurds and warn him against future provocative military actions.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Saddam Hussein is testing us,&quot; said one New York trader as stocks dropped. Oil industry shares bucked the trend.</p>
<p>The selloff on Wall Street following Monday's Labor Day holiday was also prompted by mounting fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve might increase interest rates before elections in November to keep inflationary pressures in check.</p>
<p>A report in the Wall Street Journal said U.S. policy makers were considering a larger-than-expected 0.5 percent rise in the key Fed funds interest rate.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to have a view that the Federal Reserve will tighten at the September 24 meeting,&quot; said Lehman Brothers strategist Jeffrey Applegate.</p>
<p>The sharp drop in U.S. blue chip share prices activated the New York Stock Exchange's limits on computer program trading and after an hour the Dow was down around 30 points at 5,586.</p>
<p>Market nerves steadied after the U.S. NAPM purchasing managers index for August came out at 52.6, less than an expected 52.9 and likely to provide the U.S. central bank with fewer fears about overheating.</p>
<p>But traders were on alert for even more important news on Friday of the key U.S. August non-farm payrolls data for clues on when interest rates are likely to rise.</p>
<p>Leading European stock markets had looked for a lead from Wall Street and were about one percent lower, although above their lows, in line with New York.</p>
<p>On London's International Petroleum Exchange, October futures for benchmark Brent crude were up 23 cents to $22.22 a barrel to add to a gain of $1.21 on Monday after the United Nations delayed implementation of an Iraqi oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Brent earlier hit a post-Gulf War high of $23.50 in Asia.</p>
<p>Gold prices gained around 60 cents an ounce to $387.50 in early European trade but then turned round to show a loss on the day. Bullion traders remembered losing a lot of money during the 1990 Gulf War when gold prices soared and then collapsed.</p>
<p>The dollar also slipped from earlier highs around 109.45 yen and 1.4912 marks as market operators took profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets seem to feel that this situation is not going to escalate much more,&quot; said David Bloom, currency economist at HSBC James Capel. &quot;It has helped boost the dollar initially but the focus is now back on economic data.&quot;</p>
<p>British stocks hit their day's lows in early afternoon trade as Iraq tensions dragged down British Airways and airport operator BAA among others and U.S. rate fears were strongest.</p>
<p>&quot;People are sitting on their hands, doing nothing and just watching the U.S. situation,&quot; said the head of equity trading at one London brokerage. &quot;It's the interest rate situation that is affecting things.&quot;</p>
<p>Paris shares also dropped amid added concern over French economic problems, social unrest and pessimism over corporate profits. German equities ended bourse trade sharply lower but revived in later electronic business.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1445 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 109.20 yen and 1.4843 marks, compared with 109.14 and 1.4863 in late business on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1445 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 32.3 points at 3,852.1.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index ended floor trade 22.11 adrift at 2,510.77 but revived in later computerised business.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 7.75 at 1,969.23.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $386.60 an ounce in the afternoon, down from the morning fix of $387.20 and previous London close of $386.90. Silver eased one cent to $5.18.</p>
