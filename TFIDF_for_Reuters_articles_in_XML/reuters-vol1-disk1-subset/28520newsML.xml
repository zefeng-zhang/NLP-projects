<headline>Olivetti chairman De Benedetti to step down.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN, Italy</dateline>
<text>
<p>Carlo De Benedetti is stepping down as chairman of Italian electronics group Olivetti, company sources said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sources said De Benedetti was stepping down as chairman and would be replaced by a member of the board, Antonio Tesone.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Olivetti group declined to comment, saying a statement was due later.</p>
<p>Olivetti shares fell more than 5 percent on the Milan stock exchange on Tuesday as rumours abounded about the company's financial problems and on talk of conflict between De Benedetti and new Managing Director Francesco Caio, who took over from Corrado Passera in July.</p>
<p>The ANSA news agency later reported that De Benedetti would also leave the Olivetti board. It said Caio would be in charge of day-to-day management, while the company was expected to set up an executive committee.</p>
