<title>IRAQ: U.S. missiles hit Iraq again in &quot;mop-up&quot; operation.</title>
<headline>U.S. missiles hit Iraq again in &quot;mop-up&quot; operation.</headline>
<dateline>BAGHDAD 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States fired a second wave of missiles at targets in southern Iraq on Wednesday and enforced a wider no-fly zone, pursuing one of its most serious confrontations with President Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War.</p>
<p>Iraq said one person was killed and seven were wounded.</p>
<p>Seventeen cruise missiles were fired from four ships in a &quot;mop-up&quot; operation ordered by President Bill Clinton, U.S. officials said. The second wave was aimed at targets in southern Iraq not destroyed in an attack by 27 missiles on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said the mission was intended to destroy Iraq's ability to attack aircraft enforcing an expanded no-fly zone.</p>
<p>Saddam on Tuesday vowed to resist the attacks, retaliation for Iraqi military intervention in the country's Kurdish north.</p>
<p>As Washington faced more international condemnation over the missile strikes, Iraq's official newspapers reiterated that Baghdad would ignore restrictions on flights by Iraqi aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again we say to the ungodly Americans in a loud voice ... from today there are no more imaginary parallel lines ... from today there will be no (part) of Iraqi territory off limits to us whether in the north or the south,&quot; said Babel, run by Saddam's son Uday. &quot;We shall defend our sovereignty with our nails and teeth.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. decided on Tuesday to extend the limit of the air exclusion zone in southern Iraq to the 33rd parallel, on the outskirts of Baghdad, from the 32nd parallel where it was fixed after Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>&quot;Operation Southern Watch begins at noon Baghdad time (0800 GMT) the enforcement of the extended no-fly zone,&quot; a U.S. military spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Any Iraqi air activity beyond the 33rd parallel as of 0800 GMT &quot;would be considered a violation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Expansion of the zone almost to Baghdad's suburbs would sharply curb Iraqi air power and hand America's oil-rich Gulf allies valuable extra warning time of potential trouble from Baghdad, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a just a matter of additional real estate. It backs him (Saddam) right up to his capital. It also denies him effective use of a huge chunk of his air force transport staging capability,&quot; a senior diplomat said. &quot;My assessment is the most significant action was not the missile strikes but the expansion of the zone.&quot;</p>
<p>World markets reacted calmly to the second wave of missile strikes, which briefly boosted oil prices in Asia. In Europe, shares moved higher while the dollar was steady and gold lower.</p>
<p>But in one of the sternest reactions yet, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the U.S. strikes could lead to &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot; and &quot;anarchy&quot; on the world scene. President Boris Yeltsin, backing the condemnation, saw serious complications from the attack, his chief of staff said.</p>
<p>The United States has also hit at Iraq's already crippled economy, saying Baghdad would not be able to export oil for &quot;some time&quot;, putting on hold a U.N. oil-for-food plan that would have allowed Iraqi crude onto the world market within weeks for the first time since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>France, a U.S. Gulf War ally, called on Wednesday for new negotiations to ensure that a U.N. resolution allowing Iraq to use the proceeds of oil sales for food and medical supplies could come into force as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani criticised the United States, saying: &quot;The Americans are moving wrong in Iraq and the Iraqis have given them the pretext.&quot;</p>
<p>Syria, another neighbour of Iraq, joined in widespread criticism for the Arab world, warning Washington that further raids could have unpredictable consequences.</p>
<p>But Clinton's political rival, Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, avoided criticising the attacks. &quot;In matters like this, all of us think not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans,&quot; he said. &quot;The bottom line is that Saddam Hussein is an outlaw, he's a tyrant, he's a butcher, and we cannot tolerate any further action by him in that part of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>An ABC News poll showed that Americans overwhelmingly approved of Clinton's action but indicated that most did not think the attack would stop Saddam from further violating terms of the Gulf War ceasefire.</p>
<p>Britain, one of the few countries to offer Clinton all-out backing, voiced support for the second round of strikes.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said on Tuesday night that damage from the first wave of missiles was &quot;considerable&quot; but dismissed as very unlikely Iraqi reports that civilians were among the casualties, noting that the target sites were remote.</p>
<p>Iraq said minimal damage was done in the first attacks on Tuesday and that five people had been killed and 19 wounded.</p>
<p>A divided U.N. Security Council is struggling with a response to the crisis, agreeing that Baghdad should withdraw its troops from the north but troubled by the U.S. intervention.</p>
<p>The United States used a 1991 U.N. Security Council resolution to justify its missile attacks but it was questionable if the resolution in fact mandated such action.</p>
