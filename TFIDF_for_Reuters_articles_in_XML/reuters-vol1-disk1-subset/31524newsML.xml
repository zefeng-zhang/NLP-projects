<p>Zimbabwe's civil servants streamed back to work on Wednesday after the government offered to reinstate thousands of strikers it had fired over a two-week stoppage which paralysed essential social services.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike is over,&quot; a Public Service Association union official said as about 5,000 strikers who had gathered earlier at a central park in the capital Harare left in groups for offices they deserted on August 20 to press demands for higher pay.</p>
<p>The strikers -- who included doctors, nurses, mortuary attendants, prosecutors and firefighters -- had vowed to stay on the streets this week until the government guaranteed 7,000 workers it fired two weeks ago would get their jobs back.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Public Service Minister Florence Chitauro said President Robert Mugabe's government -- which held a marathon cabinet meeting on Tuesday to settle the dispute -- had decided to reinstate the dismissed workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Notwithstanding the fact that the civil servants took part in an illegal strike, government has now resolved that all the civil servants who had been dismissed be reinstated with effect from...the 4th of September,&quot; Chitauro said.</p>
<p>This is the second time in seven days that the government of President Robert Mugabe has climbed down from its tough position against the strike -- estimated by the union to have been supported by 70 to 80 percent of the country's 180,000 civil servants.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, it offered the strikers a 20 percent rise in addition to an original nine percent increase. The strikers had demanded increases of 30 to 60 percent.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a union official who declined to be named, said although the strikers were unhappy with the government's offer, they had decided to go back to work &quot;for the sake of the nation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not happy but we have agreed that the strike is over to make sure that we restore services,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The strike -- a rare challenge to Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party who have ruled the southern African country virtually unchallenged since 1980 independence from Britain -- paralysed key social services and disrupted internal flights.</p>
<p>Hospitals were the hardest hit, with many around the country forced to close some wards. They handled emergencies only, using senior doctors helped by army medical personnel and the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Police stepped in to issue burial orders to allow people to bury their dead who piled up in unattended mortuaries.</p>
<p>&quot;For the sake of the nation, it's over,&quot; the official said, adding the civil servants would still press for negotiations for higher wage increases.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe's civil servants earn on average Z$1,000 (U.S.$98) per month and they argue that their salaries have not kept up with inflation which has averaged 22 percent a year over the past two years.</p>
<p>The strike exposed divisions in Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, with some senior officials supporting the strikers and others warning the governmnent could not afford to give in to what they described as mob rule. ($1= Z$10.20)</p>
