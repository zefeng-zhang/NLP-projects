<p>Rates on Lithuania's Treasury bills will continue falling until the parliamentary elections in October but could then rise on concerns about a possible litas devaluation, Lithuanian broker Suprema said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Suprema said in its monthly market forecast that concerns about a possible litas devaluation would scare off foreign investors and drive back T-bill rates back up.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign share in the market may decrease from 40 to 10-15 percent if the current opposition, which is clamouring for a litas devaluation, wins at the polls,&quot; Suprema said.</p>
<p>&quot;Any serious rumour about a litas devaluation would substantially affect the T-bill market and rates would quickly begin moving up.&quot;</p>
<p>The conservative parliamentary opposition has said that it favours a litas devaluation or &quot;revaluation&quot;.</p>
<p>Lithuania's T-bill rates have fallen steadily in recent months after rising sharply in the wake of a banking crisis.</p>
<p>Rates reached almost 40 percent in February but this week the average rate on 91-day paper was 11.08 percent.</p>
<p>Suprema said it did not expect yields to fall below about seven percent.</p>
<p>Suprema said domestic banks with international equity issues were behind the unexpectedly high demand in July and August which brought yields down.</p>
<p>Suprema said the banks had no other place to immediately put the money and so they invested in domestic T-bills.</p>
