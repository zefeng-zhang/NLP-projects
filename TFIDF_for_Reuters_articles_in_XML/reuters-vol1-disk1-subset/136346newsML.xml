<p>Hundreds of thousands of refugees and local Zaireans fleeing ethnic fighting in eastern Zaire are threatened with hunger and disease, aid agencies warned on Wednesday in the city of Bukavu.</p>
<p>They said Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees in camps around Bukavu and a flood of 220,000 refugees and thousands of Zaireans displaced by fighting would go hungry unless food arrived within days.</p>
<p>&quot;We are reducing rations...but it still looks like we have only five to six days of supplies left,&quot; said Abdelwahad Mahmoud Jeme, Bukavu representative of the U.N. World Food Programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Our storage rooms are almost empty. If we increase the population by 200,000, not even including local Zaireans, we will have only about three days of basic rations left,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Possibilities of increasing our supplies are nil because the two main roads into Bukavu are cut. We don't know what will happen. Unless the roads are open we will have a disaster.&quot;</p>
<p>He warned of possible epidemics among those forced from their homes and camps by fighting between the Zairean army, Zairean militias and ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge south of Bukavu.</p>
<p>Eastern Zaire has been set to explode in ethnic violence since genocide and civil war in Rwanda in 1994 sent more than a million Hutu refugees streaming in, stoking local rivalries.</p>
<p>But fighting has widened in the last six weeks since Zairean troops joined ethnic clashes between Tutsis, who have lived in Zaire for generations and are known as Banyamulenge, and native Zaireans.</p>
<p>U.N. officials say they fear an emergency similar to the 1994 Rwanda genocide and refugee exodus and are concerned at the possibility of regional conflict involving Rwanda and Burundi, whose armies are dominated by their Tutsi minorities.</p>
<p>Thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees died daily of cholera at the height of the epidemic that ravaged the Goma area of eastern Zaire in the summer of 1994.</p>
<p>Reuters photographer Corinne Dufka drove about 25 km (15 miles) south of Bukavu on Wednesday and said all villages were abandoned and machinegun and small arms fire could be heard.</p>
<p>A Zairean soldier who needed bandages said he and several other soldiers were wounded -- one seriously -- when their patrol was ambushed by what he said were Rwandan troops. He said Burundian, Ugandan and Ethiopian troops were also involved in fighting.</p>
<p>Zaire stepped up its war of words against Tutsi-dominated Rwanda and Burundi on Wednesday, accusing them of attacking the east. It urged people to give money to support Zairean troops.</p>
<p>President Mobutu Sese Seko, convalescing in Switzerland after surgery for prostate cancer, sent a message saying the top priority should be blocking &quot;invaders devastating the east&quot;.</p>
<p>Both Burundi and Rwanda denied any military role in Zaire.</p>
<p>In Kigali, Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana hit out at the international community for failing to respond to what he said was extermination of Tutsis in Zaire which would continue until the exiled Rwandan Hutu Interahamwe militia had set up its regime.</p>
<p>Some 36,000 refugees abandoned Nyangezi and Nyangezi-Mulwa camps southwest of Bukavu on Tuesday and moved to camps closer to the town. Aid workers said up to 50,000 refugees and Zairean villagers also crossed into south Bukavu from the Uvira area.</p>
<p>&quot;These people are moving not only north but west to camps southwest of Bukavu but as many are travelling through the hills their numbers are hard to estimate,&quot; said Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</p>
<p>&quot;About 1,000 people had arrived on the southern edges of Bukavu town by Tuesday night and this morning,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Stromberg said 12 refugees crossed from Zaire into Rwanda on Tuesday but UNHCR was planning in case it received 75,000.</p>
<p>In Bukavu, many people appeared angry and agitated, saying they were being invaded by neighbouring states. A gang of youths armed with sticks ran through the streets of the lakeside town.</p>
<p>Aid workers said angry Zaireans armed with spears and machetes tried to block their evacuation from eastern Zaire and it was impossible for aid agencies to work in Uvira town as nervous Zairean soldiers were looting agency vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't really afraid of the Banyamulenge. I was more afraid of defeated soldiers,&quot; said one aid worker, who declined to be identified but was evacuated from Bukavu, north of Uvira.</p>
<p>The last 58 foreign workers flew out of Uvira on Tuesday.</p>
