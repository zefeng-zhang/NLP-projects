<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Vodafone estimates cut.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- NatWest Securities confirmed that it downgraded Vodafone Group Plc to hold from add and said it set a short-term price target of $31 per American Depositary Receipt on the stock.</p>
<p>-- Andrew Melinek, head of ADR research and sales at NatWest in New York, said the U.K. analyst covering the stock had cut his earnings estimates on Vodafone to $1.64 per ADR from $1.72 for 1997, and to $1.89 from $2.09 for 1998.</p>
<p>-- The analyst, Mark Lambert, reduced his 1999 estimate to $2.33 from $2.51, and cut his 2000 estimate to $2.75 from $2.90, Melinek said.  </p>
<p>-- Lambert based his downgrade on expectations of disappointing U.K. profits, weaker than expected growth in Australia and Hong Kong, and a recent share sale by Vodafone Chief Executive Sir Gerald Whent, Melinek said.</p>
<p>-- Meanwhile, Jeffrey Hines, the U.S. analyst at NatWest who follows Vodafone, reiterated his accumulate rating on the stock but trimmed his 1997 earnings estimate.</p>
<p>-- In a report, Hines also set a 12-month price target of $49 per ADR.</p>
<p>-- Hines cut his Vodafone estimate to $1.69 from $1.78 for 1997 and kept his 1998 estimate unchanged at $2.10.</p>
<p>-- Hines trimmed his 1997 estimate to reflect continued costs associated with the migration of analog to digital subscribers on the U.K. cellular network.</p>
<p>-- Hines's report said Vodafone's overseas businesses remain on track, with Greece and South Africa currently performing ahead of expectations and Hong Kong and Australia slightly behind expectations.</p>
<p>-- Hines was not available for comment, and Melinek declined to comment on the differing opinions.</p>
<p>-- One ADR is equivalent to 10 ordinary shares.</p>
<p>-- Vodafone's ADRs were off three at 34-5/8.</p>
