<p>The European Parliament called on Tuesday for savings it made in the 1997 EU budget to be used for trans-European transport networks (TENS), the Northern Ireland peace programme and research projects.</p>
<p>The 626-member parliament, often derided as a talking shop, has the power to throw out the European Union budget and has twice done so in 1979 and 1984.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to redistribute savings of 300 million European currency units ($375 million) for the three priority areas,&quot; German Social Democrat Detlev Samland, head of the parliament's budgetary committee, told Reuters during a break in a first reading of the 1997 budget proposal.</p>
<p>The parliament is due to vote on Thursday on the executive European Commission's proposal for an 88-billion-Ecu budget, before a second and final reading in December.</p>
<p>EU leaders agreed three years ago to build trans-European networks -- 14 huge road and rail projects -- in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth.</p>
<p>But their finance ministers, worried about meeting strict budget curbs, last week rejected proposed new funding of one billion Ecus to get the projects up and running.</p>
<p>Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, who is responsible for putting the budget through parliament, said during the debate that all political parties agreed on the need for a tight budget in order to achieve the Maastricht Treaty criteria to launch a single EU currency.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a symbolic value that Europe should not be seen as a spender when national parliaments want to be parsimonious,&quot; said Brinkhorst, a Dutch member of the liberal group.</p>
<p>The parliament would keep within the Commission's spending proposal, he stressed.</p>
<p>But Pauline Green, leader of the Socialist Euro MPs, the parliament's largest political group, called for a 500-million-Ecu increase in the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We were promised new money and it has not been forthcoming,&quot; Green told a news conference.</p>
<p>On external funding, Brinkhorst said the EU should send a signal to Turkey, where the rights of Kurds were under increasing threat, by blocking all aid except for the promotion of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>The parliament has also threatened to cut EU Commissioners' salaries unless they clean up the Commission's department responsible for tourism.</p>
<p>Last week the department's German director general was asked to take early retirement as part of a reorganisation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's on the right lines but will be reviewed in December,&quot; budget committee head Samland said, noting the action was taken just three days after the warning.</p>
