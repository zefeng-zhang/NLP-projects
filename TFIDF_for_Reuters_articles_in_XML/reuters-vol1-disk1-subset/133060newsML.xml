<p>Ethnic warfare in east Zaire could hit coffee exports from the region, despite producing areas having been unaffected by two years of unrest, Zaire's OZACAF marketing board told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps with the upsurge of violence in the past few days in the region around Uvira, exports from the eastern region could be considerably affected,&quot; commercial director Henriette Musungu said. &quot;But this is not the case so far.&quot;</p>
<p>Eastern Zaire has been gripped by violence since the 1994 massacres and civil war in neighbouring Rwanda sent more than a million Hutu refugees fleeing to Zaire and stoking ethnic rivalry in the area.</p>
<p>The unrest has been degenerating into wider civil war in the last six weeks since the Zaire army got drawn into long-running ethnic clashes between Tutsi immigrants and native Zaireans.</p>
<p>The latest violence is centred around the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu and the town of Uvira, where the army and regional authorities are trying to forcibly expel Tutsis.</p>
<p>Musungu said tension in the east and the poor state of the Bukavu-Goma road has forced some exporters to divert their coffee, which previously passed through Goma, to Kalundu.</p>
<p>&quot;From Kalundu the coffee is taken by road convoy to Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) before being sent to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. So far no incident has been reported; no trucks have been attacked,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>OZACAF (Office Zairois de Cafe) figures show that the Kivu area accounts for less than 20 percent of Zaire's export coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1994-95, Zaire exported 65,00 tonnes of coffee,&quot; Musungu said. &quot;Of this amount, 31,027 tonnes came from the east of the country, but not necessarily from the area hit by violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaire's coffee season is from October to September.</p>
<p>The figures were about the same for the previous year but showed a fall of 20,717 in production from the east, though this was not related to violence, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This fall was not related strictly to disturbances in the Goma and Bukavu regions. It was rather due to an outbreak of tracheomycose (a fungal disease), which devasted plantations and was commonly referred to as coffee AIDS,&quot; Musungu said.</p>
<p>Coffee from eastern Zaire, most of it robusta, is produced around Goma, Bukavu, Beni and Bania.</p>
<p>Beni and Bania are in Upper Zaire Province which is not affected by violence. Other producing provinces outside the unrest zone are northeastern Equator, Lower Zaire to the southwest and western Bandundu.</p>
<p>Most of Zaire's coffee is exported to Europe through the Kenyan port of Mombasa via the route that passes through Tanzania.</p>
<p>Other export routes are through Zongo in Equator Province close to Central African Republic and through the Atlantic port of Matadi, near Angola.</p>
<p>OZACAF has 75 licensed exporters in the country who ship mostly to Italy and Belgium.</p>
