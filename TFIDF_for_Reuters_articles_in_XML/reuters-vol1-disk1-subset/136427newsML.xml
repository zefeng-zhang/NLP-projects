<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, asserting his authority as President Boris Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery, urged Russia's powerful security services on Wednesday to steer clear of political conflicts.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as telling leaders of the Federal Security Service (FSB) to work with their agents &quot;so that they do not allow themselves to be dragged into conflict between various political groups&quot;.</p>
<p>FSB chief Nikolai Kovalyov said the situation in breakaway Chechnya represented a &quot;serious danger&quot; and warned of terrorism spreading across the country.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin told the FSB, a successor to the Soviet KGB, that certain people were striving &quot;to use the process of democratic reforms in the country to create extremist, militarised, terrorist and other formations&quot;.</p>
<p>His remarks reflected concern about fragile harmony in the Kremlin after Yeltsin sacked outspoken security chief Alexander Lebed last week for stirring up dissent.</p>
<p>But as Kovalyov made clear, it is not just the dissent at the heart of power which worries Kremlin leaders.</p>
<p>His words on the threat from Chechnya appeared to cast doubt on a peace deal signed on August 31 by Lebed and separatist chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>The deal ended almost 21 months of fighting in which Lebed says up to 100,000 people have been killed. But it has been criticised by the State Duma lower chamber of parliament, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and other Lebed rivals.</p>
<p>Although Lebed is now out of office, the campaign against him shows no sign of slowing down. Documents which Russia's interior ministry said backed accusations levied against Lebed have been forwarded to Russian prosecutors, Tass reported.</p>
<p>The ex-paratroop general, who sees himself as a future president, was accused by Kulikov of seeking to create a 50,000-strong private army and of plotting a coup. Lebed denies the accusations.</p>
<p>Moscow, which also feels threatened by planned NATO expansion in Eastern Europe, reacted coolly to U.S. President Bill Clinton's commitment to try to bring some former communist states into the alliance by 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to make a specific comment. All I can do is to repeat our general position that we have a negative attitude to the plans for expanding NATO,&quot; Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov told reporters.</p>
<p>Pressed for more details, he added: &quot;Let's wait and see&quot;.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has consistently opposed the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to include its former communist-era allies in Eastern Europe, saying the idea risks creating new lines of division.</p>
<p>Russian officials, keen to dispel the image of a country slowly falling apart, were quick to dismiss a U.S. intelligence report which said Moscow's control over its nuclear arsenal had been weakening amid the current uncertainty.</p>
<p>But the country's lower house of parliament stoked up more trouble on Wednesday when it voted to halt the division of the Black Sea Fleet with Ukraine in a move likely to worsen the already uneasy relations between the former Soviet republics.</p>
