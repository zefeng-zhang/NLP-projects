<p>The European Union, otherwise buoyant about chances for a new era with a single currency, has suddenly found itself under assault from sceptics on all sides.</p>
<p>From the platform of Britain's Referendum Party congress last weekend to European Parliament elections in Austria and Finland over the past fortnight, politicians hostile to the EU have grabbed the headlines and, in some cases, votes.</p>
<p>&quot;The crisis in Europe is the sum of the national crises in European countries,&quot; Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said this week.</p>
<p>Austrians cast nearly 28 percent of their ballots for the far right, anti-EU Freedom Party; Finns put well-known Euro-sceptics at the top of voting preferences.</p>
<p>Polls in Sweden, meanwhile, show that many citizens there now wish they had never joined the bloc. Surveys in pro-Europe Germany regularly show disdain for the EU's most ambitious project, the single currency.</p>
<p>Britain is torn over its role in the EU while Denmark, always among the least keen to integrate, has effectively been forced by Euro-sceptics to take the Maastricht Treaty to court again.</p>
<p>A case over procedure is threatening ratification of a new EU treaty to prepare for new members from eastern Europe. It spilled over into EU business on Tuesday by forcing Copenhagen to block EU moves in a trade fight with the United States.</p>
<p>Throw in resistance in France and elsewhere to the budget belt-tightening required for the single currency and the architects of an ever closer Union could be forgiven for acting as if their grand European project was unravelling.</p>
<p>But the mood among those architects and their supporters is actually far from glum.</p>
<p>EU leaders meeting earlier this month at a special summit were generally positive about the bloc's future, seeing both the single currency and enlargement as basically on track.</p>
<p>There is a widespread view in European capitals that most opposition can be overcome, that a new treaty will be completed next year, that the currency will start on time in January 1999 and that enlargement will occur early in the new century.</p>
<p>Nearly all the bad news of recent weeks -- notably the rise in Euro-scepticism -- is dismissed as local politics or the failure of national governments to give citizens what they want.</p>
<p>In any case, the EU has had plenty of gloom to ignore before. Ever since the Danes turned the EU on its head in 1992 by rejecting the Maastricht Treaty in a first referendum, politicians have come to expect anti-EU grumbling.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more common that there is a negative mood. The politicians are more used to this,&quot; said one long-time EU diplomat.</p>
<p>Governments negotiating the new treaty for the EU have recognised this, he said, by focusing much of the debate on citizen-friendly issues such as fighting crime or creating jobs.</p>
<p>But the problem, says Peter Ludlow of the Brussels-based Centre for European Studies, is that EU leaders are so wrapped up in their own domestic problems they have little time to address their public on Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The counter-attack (about the advantages of the EU) has been slow in coming,&quot; he said. &quot;Noble rhetoric is called for but there's nobody there to do it.&quot;</p>
