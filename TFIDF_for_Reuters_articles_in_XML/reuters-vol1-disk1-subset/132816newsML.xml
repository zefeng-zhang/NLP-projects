<p>Blackburn Rovers, bottom of the English premier league without a win this season, dismissed reports on Tuesday they are interested in buying Brazilian striker Bebeto.</p>
<p>Blackburn chairman Robert Coar stressed there was &quot;nothing doing&quot; in newspaper speculation linking the club with Bebeto, who was an integral part of Brazil's World Cup-winning side in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just the latest name to be floated across us and that's all it is,&quot; added Coar when asked about the prospect of the 32-year-old forward joining Rovers.</p>
<p>British newspapers quoted Blackburn manager Ray Harford as saying: &quot;There is no questioning the fact that he (Bebeto) is a sensational player, one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems he is very keen to come to England. He has seen the likes of Juninho do well over here and believes it offers a new challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspaper reports said Harford had been contacted by Bebeto's agent and that the player was expected to cost around five million pounds ($8 million) in fees and wages. He moved to Flamengo from Spanish side Deportivo Coruna at the end of last season.</p>
<p>Blackburn are looking for a replacement for England striker Alan Shearer, who was sold to Newcastle United for a world record 15 million pounds sterling ($24 million) just before the current season.</p>
