<p>Malaysia's central bank said it accepted bids at an average yield of 6.687 percent at its auction of 91-day Bank Negara bills for 500 million ringgit.</p>
<p>At its previous auction on October 14 for a similar amount, bids were accepted at an average yield of 6.649 percent.</p>
<p>The accepted bids were in the high/low range of 6.70/645 percent against 6.657/635 last week.</p>
<p>The central bank also auctioned 30-day Bank Negara bills to raise 500 million ringgit. The bids accepted were at an average yield of 6.689 percent against 6.633 accepted at an auction for a similar amount last week.</p>
<p>The bids accepted for the 30-day bills were in the high/low range of 6.720/555 percent against 6.660/555 last week.</p>
<p>Payment for both issues is on Wednesday.</p>
<p>While 500 million ringgit will come from a maturing Bank Negara bill, a large part of the remaining amount is expected to come from a Bank Negara deposit which matured on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
