<p>*Stronger resources bolstered Australian shares which ended</p>
<p>near a record close. Volume 305.2 million shares valued at A$632.1</p>
<p>million, 1,034 stocks traded, 324 steady, 356 rises, 354 falls</p>
<p>The Australian share market ended firm on Monday, just a few points away from its record closing high level after resources found support on the back of a firmer copper price and another record close for the Dow on Friday.</p>
<p>The key share market barometer, the All Ordinaries index closed 8.2 points higher at 2,363.2, three points off its all time record high closing level of 2,366.2, set last week.</p>
<p>The December share price index closed down six points at 2,378, a 14.8 point premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Brokers said buying support for key blue chip resource issues CRA and BHP underpinned market gains during the session.  </p>
<p>&quot;The last few sessions have been similar, with the market swelling through to lunch but pulling back in the afternnon,&quot; a Perth-based dealer said.</p>
<p>The dealer said this trade pattern revealed the cautiousness of local investors who were keen to take profits early and reluctant to hold long positions overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;The concern is with a possible Dow pullback,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although earnings reports are backing up the bulls on Wall Street, the worry is that the U.S. market is fundamentally overbought and is due for a sharp correction,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>In other market news, investor interest was focused on engineering group ANI whose annual meeting in Sydney today failed to deliver an outcome to a directors' dispute concerning ANI's investment in the troubled Holter Environmental Systems.</p>
<p>Nickel hopeful Anaconda Nickel was a star performer after the company released its annual report. In the report, Anaconda revealed it was close to naming an equity partner for its Murrin Murrin nickel project in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Foster's Brewing ended weaker after an arbitration panel ruling on Friday which ended a licensing agreement between its 40-percent-owned Canadian brewer Molson and U.S. brewer Coors.  </p>
<p>In other markets, Australian bonds ended firmer amid confidence that this Wednesday's quarterly inflation report will be subdued. The yield on 10-year T-bonds closed at 7.54 percent, 0.06 percent lower than Friday's close.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar hit a five-year high in trade weighted terms as investors targeted higher yielding havens. At 5.00 p.m. (0700 GMT), the unit was quoted at US$0.7973/78.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Dealers said futures were busy but options trade slowed in line with lower activity in the physical market. Total options traded 42,525 (59,871).</p>
<p>Turnover in December SPI contracts totalled 5,923 (4,936).  </p>
