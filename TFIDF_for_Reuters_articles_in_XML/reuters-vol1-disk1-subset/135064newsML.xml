<p>Precious metals prices climbed higher in a bullish mood in early trading on Tuesday, extending gains posted the previous day, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold broke out of its $378-$382 range and the market is very bullish,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;It was holding at $380 for so long the market was frustrated and decided to try the upside.&quot;</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $382.40 an ounce, compared to $381.00 on Monday afternoon and a London closing of $381.50/$382.00.</p>
<p>Further tests of upside resistance were likely, dealers and analysts said, although some added that gains were probably limited and possibly shortlived.</p>
<p>Gold drifted to 18-month lows earlier this month, undermined by indifference from investors and speculators and weaker than expected demand from the jewellery industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not convinced. I think we're just in a new $381-$383 range. The producer selling that was around last week to depress prices is still around,&quot; the dealer said. Strong resistance was expected at around $384 an ounce.</p>
<p>Still, a series of uptrending technical indicators on historical price charts suggested a forthcoming upswing, some technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sudden bursts of strength enjoyed by gold, platinum and silver yesterday much reduces downside risk,&quot; analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed there is a possibility the lows have been seen and a bout of worthwhile corrective strength could soon come through.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold prices have broken above a medium-term downtrend line which joins the peak of the February 1996 rally with highs in late August. A close above the trendline, currently at $381.60 an ounce, would confirm that breach, analysts said.</p>
<p>Also contributing to a more positive technical picture, the 10-day moving average was on the verge of crossing the 30-day moving average on the upside, while the 14-day RSI was trending up from oversold positions earlier this month.</p>
<p>Silver followed gold higher and was trading at $4.95/$4.97 an ounce, up two cents from Monday's London close.</p>
<p>&quot;It ended at the top end of its $4.87-$4.93 range on Monday. It seemed to have tagged along for the ride,&quot; a dealer said. The psychological $5.00 was silver's key hurdle.</p>
<p>Platinum was trading $1.00 stronger compared to Monday's finish at $384.50/$385.50 an ounce. Palladium was $0.50 firmer at $117.00/$118.00. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
