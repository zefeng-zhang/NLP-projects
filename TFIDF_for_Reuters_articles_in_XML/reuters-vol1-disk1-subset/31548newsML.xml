<title>BURKINA FASO: Burkina court rules against extradition of Rwandan.</title>
<headline>Burkina court rules against extradition of Rwandan.</headline>
<dateline>OUAGADOUGOU 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Burkina Faso court ruled on Wednesday against the extradition of a former senior Rwandan administrator for trial in his homeland on charges of involvement in genocide.</p>
<p>But it said Colonel Alphonse Ntezilyayo, a former prefect of Butare, could be extradited to stand trial before the United Nations international tribunal on Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania.</p>
<p>Ntezilyayo was expected to be set free after the judge, who cited procedural flaws for his decision, also deplored &quot;the illegality of the detention&quot; of the colonel.</p>
<p>The former officer, from Rwanda's majority Hutu tribe, has been detained in Ouagadougou since July 4. In a hearing a week ago, he denied charges of involvement in the 1994 massacre of up to a million minority Tutsis or Hutu moderates, blamed largely on the former Hutu army and its tribal militia allies.</p>
<p>The charges against Ntelzilyayo said that while he was prefect of Butare he held meetings of Hutu Interahamwe militias and the presidential guard to plan massacres, helped killers escape to the safe zone controlled by French troops, and later used death threats to force other Hutus to leave Rwanda.</p>
<p>Ntezilyayo told the court he had only been prefect of Butare from June 20 to July 2, 1994 and his main preoccupation had been to help Hutus and Tutsis flee the combat zone.</p>
<p>He said he feared the new Tutsi-dominated government in Kigali had accused him because he was the kind of educated Hutu they wanted to wipe out.</p>
<p>&quot;As a Hutu, with an intellectual training which places me among the elite, having left a large quantity of property and land in my country, I believe I would be condemned to death if I ever returned to Rwanda,&quot; he said in the hearing on August 28.</p>
<p>The judge then expressed concern at procedural irregularities, saying the summons had been signed by a state prosecutor and not an examining magistrate.</p>
<p>He said the court had to either declare the procedure invalid or agree to Ntezilyayo's extradition to the Arusha tribunal, adding that he was concerned that Ntezilyayo would not receive a fair trial if he returned to Rwanda.</p>
<p>There was no sign that the international tribunal had requested the extradition of the officer.</p>
