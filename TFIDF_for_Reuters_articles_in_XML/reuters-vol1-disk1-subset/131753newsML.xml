<p>Slovenian shares fell on Monday as investors continued to take profits out of a recent bull run, but market participants said the potential for further declines was limited.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently the feeling on the market is a little nervous, but I think shares fell enough and a rebound could come very soon,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The SBI index fell 18.72 points or 1.44 percent to 1,249.9. Overall 13 shares fell, five rose and one was unchanged, while five issues were untraded.</p>
<p>Bank SKB was the most actively traded share, falling 1.69 percent to close at 40,020 tolars on volume of 1,450 shares for total turnover of 184.4 million tolars.</p>
<p>&quot;SKB fell today after making big advances recently on rumours that it will list its shares in London,&quot; said Iztok Slapar, a trader at brokerage Nika. SKB has declined to comment on the issue.</p>
<p>Trading company Kovinotehna was the leading decliner, falling 5.99 percent to 455 tolars on volume of 2,666 shares.</p>
<p>Drug maker Lek's issue &quot;C&quot; was the biggest gainer, firming 2.94 percent to 21,000 tolars on volume of two shares. Lek's &quot;A&quot; issue rose 2.23 percent to 21,980 tolars on volume of 7,069 shares.</p>
<p>Total turnover fell to 399.3 million tolars from 461.6 million tolars on Friday.</p>
