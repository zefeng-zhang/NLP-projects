<title>BOSNIA: Yugoslav trade mission completes Sarajevo visit.</title>
<headline>Yugoslav trade mission completes Sarajevo visit.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1996-08-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Yugoslav trade mission on Monday completed the first such visit to Sarajevo since the Bosnian war broke out in 1992.</p>
<p>The Yugoslava mission, headed by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, was returning a similar one-day visit to Belgrade by Bosnian trade delegation on July 23.</p>
<p>Sainovic said on departure from the Bosnian capital that &quot;numerous forms of economic cooperation had been agreed with the government in Sarajevo&quot;.</p>
<p>Among them, he was quoted by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjung as saying, was a decision for the Yugoslav airline JAT to begin a service to Sarajevo next week.</p>
<p>Sarajevo aiport opened for civilian traffic earlier this month after being closed to all but military and relief flights for four years.</p>
<p>Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic, who met the trade delegation, said discussions had focused on setting up a &quot;more intensive economic relationship&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed concretely for experts to meet in the shortest possible time to define a (common) payment system and to define border crossings and procedures,&quot; Muratovic told reporters.</p>
<p>Sainovic said his delegation's meetings with Bosnian government officials and private businessmen had furthered the cause of the Dayton peace agreement, which ended the 43-month Bosnian war last December.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic development needs to be the long-lasting cement of the peace agreement,&quot; Sainovic said.</p>
<p>Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic, who led the Bosnian trade mission to Belgrade in July, said Monday's talks represented a continuation of what began in the Yugoslav capital last month.</p>
<p>&quot;The main issue of today's talks was trade in order to create a new urgency for resolving other problems,&quot; Ganic said.</p>
<p>Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic met Sainovic, Bosnian radio reported.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia lost four of its six republics in recent years as Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia gained independence. Croatia and Bosnia fought protracted wars, in part against the republics of Serbia and Montenegro which remained behind and formed rump Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia and Croatia signed a mutual recognition accord on Friday, ending five years of hostility between them.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia and Bosnia have not yet recognised one another, but the exchange of trade delegations is viewed by diplomats as a practical step in that direction and another sign that stability is returning to the Balkans.</p>
<p>&quot;We of course welcome this visit,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia John Menzies said of the Yugoslav trip to Sarajevo.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought it was a major breakthrough when Mr. Ganic visited Belgrade. We are very glad to see the return visit.&quot;</p>
