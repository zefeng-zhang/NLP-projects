<p>Michael Andretti bounced back from a painful injury to capture the provisional pole for the Molson Indy Vancouver Grand Prix on Friday.</p>
<p>Andretti, who suffered a moderate shoulder and back injury in an open test session at Laguna Seca Raceway in California Tuesday, broke the track record with a lap of 54.928 seconds around the 10-turn, 1.703 mile (2.741 km) track at the Concord Pacific Place street circuit in a Lola Ford Cosworth.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels better by the hour,&quot; said Andretti, a two-time winner (1991-1992) and three-time polesitter here (1990-1992) whose last pole was at the 1995 Long Beach street circuit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to be here (on the pole) today,&quot; he said, noting that final qualifying is on Saturday, &quot;but I want to be here tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Bryan Herta was second fastest in the session with a time of 54.930 seconds as seven drivers eclipsed the record of 55.226 seconds set here last year by Jacques Villeneuve, who is currently on the Formula One circuit.</p>
<p>As the IndyCar series title chase winds down to the final two races, four-time Vancouver winner Al Unser Jr, 23 points behind points series leader Jimmy Vasser, had a strong performance with a third fastest time of 55.004 seconds in a Penske Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>Unser, a two-time series champion, is winless since last year's event here. Besides Andretti, Unser is the only winner in this event's previous six years.</p>
<p>Vasser, suffering from a bad chassis vibration, was 17th in qualifying Friday.</p>
<p>Final qualifying for Sunday's race will take place on Saturday.</p>
