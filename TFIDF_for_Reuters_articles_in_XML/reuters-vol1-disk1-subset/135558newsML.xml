<p>Unilever's drive to increase profitability will not result in the sale of 20 percent of its businesses, as some analysts have speculated, co-chairman Morris Tabaksblat said in a newspaper interview.</p>
<p>Tabaksblat said Unilever NV /Plc was currently reviewing the performance of businesses which accounted for some 20 percent of its annual turnover of around 80 billion guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;Our first goal is improving profitability. If that doesn't succeed we can divest, but it would certainly be less than half of that 20 percent.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tabaksblat said Unilever aimed to complete the current review in two years but said other businesses might well have to be reviewed in the future. &quot;It's an ongoing process,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tabaksblat said Unilever had been refocusing on its core businesses since the mid-1980s, in some cases selling off whole divisions, such as animal feed and packaging.</p>
<p>&quot;Within our core businesses, however, we haven't looked closely enough at what is really core, where we really create added value,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tabaksblat said that in addition to streamlining its existing businesses in Europe and North America, Unilever would continue to expand in emerging markets.</p>
<p>These would generate some 35 percent of total turnover in the year 2000 and 50 percent by 2010, he said.</p>
<p>Tabaksblat said there were no differences of opinion between himself and his fellow co-chairman Niall FitzGerald.</p>
<p>FitzGerald told Reuters Financial Television earlier this month that the Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant needed to sharpen its focus.</p>
<p>&quot;We will judge how we change (the portfolio) based on the ability of individual parts of the portfolio to add real value, economic value, which translates into shareholder value.&quot;</p>
