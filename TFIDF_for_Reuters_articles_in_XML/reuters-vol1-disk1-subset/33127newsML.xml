<p>The United States on Tuesday night launched a second cruise missile attack on Iraq, firing 17 Tomahawks from a U.S. submarine and three surface warships to further damage air defences in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Pentagon and White House said the repeat strike was authorised by President Bill Clinton and was made against a number of targets that were not completely damaged in an attack by 27 missiles earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The $1.2 million Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from the ships in the Gulf at military targets such as radars in southern Iraq early on Wednesday morning Iraq time.</p>
<p>Eight missiles were fired by the destroyer Russell, five by the destroyer Laboon, two by the destroyer Hewitt and two by the Los Angeles Class attack submarine Jefferson City.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what we call a mop-up operation,&quot; Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters at a briefing.</p>
<p>Defence officials said an attack by 27 missiles fired from two warships and B-52 bombers earlier on Tuesday had not done the damage expected against all Iraqi missile defence targets in the southern part of the country.</p>
<p>The unilateral missile attacks were launched after Saddam had reportedly ignored demands to cease an assault on Kurds in northern Iraq and withdraw his troops.</p>
<p>Bacon said Clinton authorised the strikes to supress air defences over southern Iraq and provide a greater margin of safety for U.S. and allied pilots who will police an expanded &quot;no-fly&quot; zone over southern Iraq beginning at noon on Wednesday in Baghdad (0800 GMT).</p>
<p>The new southern no-fly zone extends north from Iraq's southern border all the way to the outskirts of Baghdad.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the second strike) required additional approval and he (Clinton) granted that this afternoon,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an effort to go in and assure that we have done everything possible to supress air defences before we start enforcing the expanded no-fly zone ... we want to guarantee that our pilots have every opportunity to fly safely.&quot;</p>
<p>But Bacon said in response to questions that, &quot;in the defence business, I don't think there is any such thing as impunity&quot; for pilots.</p>
