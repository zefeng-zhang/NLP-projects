<headline>Mafia boss seeks pardon for accused wife killer.</headline>
<dateline>CATANIA, Sicily 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Jailed Sicilian Mafia boss Benedetto &quot;Nitto&quot; Santapaola has sent a letter to prosecutors asking them to pardon the man accused of gunning down his wife, Italian newspapers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Ferone is accused of murdering Grazia Minniti on September 1, 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;I tried to force myself to hate Mr Ferone for the barbarous murder of my wife, but I wasn't able to...not only for the fear of God but because the warm voice of my wife suggested it (the pardon),&quot; Santapaola was quoted as writing.</p>
<p>Minniti, 54, was shot twice in the chest at her home in Tremestieri Etneo, just outside the eastern city of Catania, when her daughter Cosima opened the door to two men who said they were police officers.</p>
<p>Prosecutors reacted to Santapaola's letter with caution.</p>
<p>&quot;We never let ourselves be intimidated by threats and now we will not be moved by appeals,&quot; Catania's chief prosecutor Mario Buni told Corriere della Sera newspaper.</p>
<p>Newspapers said Santapaola's three-page handwritten letter was sent on Saturday to the two prosecutors investigating Minniti's murder and the preliminary hearing judge who is considering whether to send Ferone to trial for the crime.</p>
<p>Santapaola, nicknamed &quot;The Hunter&quot; and accused of some of Cosa Nostra's bloodiest excesses, was arrested in May 1993 after 10 years on the run. His two sons are also in jail.</p>
<p>Santapaola had already been sentenced to life in jail in his absence for Mafia crimes before his arrest.</p>
<p>He is now on trial with 40 others for alleged involvement in the killing of leading anti-Mafia investigator Giovanni Falcone, whose car was blown up on a motorway near Palermo in May 1992.</p>
