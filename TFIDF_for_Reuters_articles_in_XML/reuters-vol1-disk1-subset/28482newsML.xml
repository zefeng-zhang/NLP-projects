<p>News of U.S. missile attacks on Iraq fired up the oil market on Tuesday and sent nervous European stock markets into reverse in morning business.</p>
<p>&quot;The mood is very twitchy,&quot; said one London share trader. &quot;No market players like periods of uncertainty.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. retaliation for weekend incursions by Iraqi troops into Kurdish areas also gave limited support to gold and the dollar, safe havens for funds at times of crisis, and allowed markets to forget worries about European monetary union for now.</p>
<p>But traders said the strength of the European market reaction would depend on what happened next in the confrontation with Iraq and what lead comes from across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>A statement by President Bill Clinton is due at 1200 GMT, followed by Wall Street's opening after Monday's Labor Day holiday at 1330 GMT and the first of this week's key U.S. economic statistics half an hour later.</p>
<p>London share traders expect Wall Street to come under pressure after a report in the Wall Street Journal said U.S. policy makers were considering a larger-than-expected 0.5 percent rise in the key Fed funds interest rate.</p>
<p>By late morning on London's International Petroleum Exchange, October futures for benchmark Brent crude were up 68 cents to $22.67 a barrel to add to a gain of $1.21 on Monday after the United Nations delayed implementation of an Iraqi oil-for-food deal. Brent earlier hit a high of $23.50 in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going through a Gulf War instant replay,&quot; said analyst Charles Gray at broker Prudential Bache. &quot;Iraqi oil is not on the agenda until after the U.S. election (in November).&quot;</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, traders had been expecting Iraq's first oil sales for six years since the Gulf War to hit markets that were already around $4 higher than last year.</p>
<p>Gold prices gained around 60 cents an ounce to $387.50 in early European trade but then eased back. &quot;If the conflict does not escalate, prices are not likely to gain much. But now we have to wait and see,&quot; one dealer at a major Swiss bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see gold at $400 because of this,&quot; another dealer said, adding traders remembered losing a lot of money during the 1990 Gulf War when gold prices soared and then collapsed.</p>
<p>The dollar, which has been boosted by speculation on higher U.S. interest rates as well as the renewed Middle Eastern tensions, also slipped from earlier highs around 109.45 yen and 1.4912 marks as market operators took profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets seem to feel that this situation is not going to escalate much more,&quot; said David Bloom, currency economist at HSBC James Capel. &quot;It has helped boost the dollar initially but the focus is now back on economic data.&quot;</p>
<p>The London stock market, Europe's biggest, opened weaker and then extended its losses, more than wiping out Monday's gains despite compensation from higher oil company share prices. Government share placings added to the downward pressure.</p>
<p>French shares also dropped in line with bonds and with added concern over French economic problems, social unrest and pessimism over corporate profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The attack by the Americans on Iraq is hitting the market,&quot; said one French trader. &quot;Practically the only stocks showing plus signs are the oil stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares also weakened although traders said concern over coming economic news was a more significant influence than the missile attacks on Iraqi air defence targets.</p>
<p>On the economic front, U.S. NAPM purchasing managers figures for August, due at 1400 GMT, and news on Friday of the key U.S. August non-farm payrolls data are the key events which could give clues on when interest rates are likely to rise.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey expected the NAPM index to rise to 52.9 from 50.2 in July but it could be even stronger, analysts said.</p>
<p>Second-quarter economic growth figures for France and Germany are also on the week's menu of statistics and could put further pressure on the French franc, analysts said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1115 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 109.17 yen and 1.4867 marks, compared with 109.14 and 1.4863 in late business on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1115 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 27.7 points at 3,856.7.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was 18.90 adrift at 2,513.98.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 20.37 at 1,956.61.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $387.20 an ounce in the morning, up from the previous London close of $386.90 and afternoon fixing of $386.55. Silver gained one cent to $5.20.</p>
