<p>Beach residents were urged to evacuate voluntarily on Wednesday as Hurricane Fran headed toward the coastline between the historic cities of Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) Fran was 515 miles (830 km) southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Centre said. Its winds of 115 mph (185 kmh) made it a dangerous Category 3 hurricane and forecasters said weather conditions and warm Atlantic waters could intensify it into a Category 4 storm by the time it hits the U.S. coast, probably on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Hurricane Hugo, ranked as the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history, was a Category 4 storm. It slammed into Charleston on Sept. 21, 1989, with winds clocked at more than 140 mph (225 kmh) and caused more than $7 billion worth of damage. Hugo was also blamed for 27 deaths and destroyed some 17,000 homes in the historic city of Charleston.</p>
<p>Fran's exact position at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) was latitude 27.0 north and longitude 74.6 west.</p>
<p>South Carolina Gov. David Beasley urged voluntary relocation of all residents and tourists on barrier islands and beachfront property along the coast.</p>
<p>Calling Fran a &quot;relentless adversary,&quot; he also urged those living in low-lying areas on or near the coast from Little River south to evacuate voluntarily. &quot;At this time we do not believe that there are any areas of our coast excluded from potential serious damage,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch area extended from Sebastian Inlet near Vero Beach, Florida, to Little River Inlet at the border of North and South Carolina. &quot;We're expecting landfall maybe late tomorrow night, and probably somewhere along the Georgia or South Carolina coast,&quot; hurricane centre forecaster Michelle Huber said.</p>
<p>At Cape Canaveral, about halfway up the Florida coast, NASA managers ordered the shuttle Atlantis moved back to its massive garage. Atlantis, already six weeks late because of rocket problems, was due to blast off on Sept. 14 on a mission to pick up U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid from the Russian Mir space station and drop off her replacement, John Blaha.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was also in effect for the northwestern Bahamas as Fran moved northwest across the Atlantic toward the United States at 12 mph (20 kph).</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible that Fran could become a Category 4 storm as it moves closer to the coast. If it slows down over the Gulf Stream, it gives Fran more time to intensify,&quot; Huber said.</p>
<p>Tides of three to six feet (1 to 2 metres) above normal were expected along the coastline stretching from northern Florida to the Carolinas.</p>
