<p>A top Beijing official said on Wednesday that China was practising &quot;democracy with Chinese characteristics,&quot; and ruled out the Communist Party adopting a Western-style democratic system.</p>
<p>&quot;We practise a multi-party cooperation and political consultation system, with the Communist Party of China (CPC) as the party in power,&quot; Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress, or parliament, said in an interview with a German newspaper.</p>
<p>China has eight tiny &quot;democratic&quot; parties, which pose no threat or challenge to the Communist Party and are more than eager to go along with the ruling party's policies.</p>
<p>&quot;This system...is a system with Chinese characteristics, which is not like Western multi-party or two-party systems, nor like a one-party system,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency quoted Qiao as saying.</p>
<p>He said China was committed to improving its democratic system but added the Communist Party would forever remain loyal to Marxist principles.</p>
<p>&quot;China's history and reality has determined that the CPC will never become a socialist democratic party,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics is bound to be built up as long as unremitting efforts are made,&quot; Qiao said.</p>
<p>China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping coined the phrase &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; to justify the sweeping market reforms that he launched in the late 1970s, reversing Mao Zedong's egalitarian policies.</p>
