<p>U.S. economic figures will take a back seat in the week ahead, allowing a scattering of data releases from other countries to take precedence in financial markets, analysts say.</p>
<p>Teis Knuthsen, international economist at First Chicago in London, said Friday's durable goods data for September will be overshadowed by the prospect of non-farm payrolls data for the same month, due on November 1.</p>
<p>Data released earlier in October showed a surprise fall in the all-important payrolls number, backing the Federal Reserve's decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged in September.</p>
<p>&quot;Until that unexpected...drop is either confirmed or rejected by the next payrolls report, all the other U.S. data will be secondary,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Durable goods data alone were unlikely to be sufficiently influential to change market sentiment, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Durable goods figures are very volatile numbers,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London. &quot;After last month's fall we should see some rebound, but that on its own isn't going to be enough to turn sentiment around.&quot;</p>
<p>The August figure showed a fall of 3.1 percent, but analysts forecast a September rise of 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>In Germany, the focus will be figures for the broad M3 measure of money supply in September, expected early in the week. A Reuters poll predicted an 8.4 percent rise in the year-on-year rate of growth compared with 8.7 percent in August.</p>
<p>Stamenkovic said a figure of 8.1 percent would reignite hopes of a cut in the key German repo rate, now 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>He said strong survey evidence and the weak mark had taken the pressure off the Bundesbank to ease rates, but he still expected a 25 basis point cut by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don Smith, UK economist at HSBC Markets said the major focus in Britain would be on Friday's third quarter gross domestic product data (GDP). The forecast is for quarter-on-quarter rise of 0.4 percent, and a year-on-year rise of 2.3 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;GDP is most important because it has potential to make a significant change in the market's outlook,&quot; said Smith. &quot;There has been a sentiment swing to expect a rate hike before March.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there was some talk that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Ken Clarke would raise interest rates as soon as October 30, to avoid having to raise them just before the general election.</p>
<p>Britain's ruling Conservative government must call a general election by the end of May 1997.</p>
<p>British retail sales data for September are also due for release on Wednesday, with expectations for a monthly fall of 0.1 percent. But Smith said he expected the crucial consumer figures to surprise the market, with a drop of 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting to see a hefty fall in retail sales which the market hasn't priced in,&quot; he said. &quot;The message it will give is that consumers aren't accepting price increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Monday also sees the start of a two-day Bank of Japan regional managers' meeting, where BOJ governor Yasuo Matsushita was scheduled to deliver a speech.</p>
<p>Analysts said the meeting was expected to show that Japanese interest rates were on hold for the time being.</p>
<p>The outcome of Japan's general election on Sunday will also be watched closely by the markets, although most believe Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashiimoto's Liberal Democratic Party is poised to win. Some political analysts forecast a possible landslide.</p>
<p>National Japanese consumer price data for September is due for release on Friday, with a year-on-year fall of 0.2 percent forecast by the markets.</p>
<p>French consumer prices are also due at the end of the week, and analysts say a weak number would unsettle the markets.</p>
<p>&quot;If growth in France and Germany diverges it will increase scepticism about plans for a single currency,&quot; said Smith.</p>
