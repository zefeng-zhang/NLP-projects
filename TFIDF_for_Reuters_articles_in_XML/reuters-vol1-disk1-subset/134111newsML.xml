<p>French stocks ended a touch weaker on continued but limited consolidation on Tuesday with a see-saw day for magazines-to-missiles group Lagardere after the euphoric reaction to its planned takeover of Thomson SA.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 4.61 points or 0.21 percent at 2,175.61 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down five at 2,182.0.</p>
<p>Volume was a healthy 5.02 billion francs, of which 3.3 billion was in the CAC-40 shares.  </p>
<p>More than 3.5 million shares in Lagardere changed hands but a further surge of 5.3 percent soon petered out and the stock slid into the red in the afternoon on profit-taking before creeping back to end at 177.8, up 0.68 percent.</p>
<p>Tuesday's announcement of a 38 percent jump in first-half net attributable profit to 409 million francs was sidelined by the continued focus on its plans to take over Thomson SA.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders said a company presentation of the deal provided little new information but a cautious delivery provided room for a pause after the euphoric reaction that sent the stock soaring in recent days on the back of the Thomson news.  </p>
<p>Overall, traders said a relatively robust market could see a bit more slippage -- to 2,150 according to some -- in the wake of a run which took the CAC-40 to a new high last Friday.</p>
<p>*Oil giants Elf Aquitaine and Total both gained on oil price firmness, with Elf hitting a new high of 429.0 francs before both stocks eased off their session highs.</p>
<p>*Thomson CSF trading well above the 156 francs offered by Lagardere to buy out minorities, with some traders talking of speculative buying in the hope that a higher buyout offer from the group could ultimately materialise.  </p>
<p>*TV groups TF1, Canal Plus weaker. TF1 chairman Patrick Le Lay says in newspaper interview company has launched emergency interim proceedings against Canal Plus to exclude sports cover from Canal Plus's merger with Nethold.</p>
<p>*Media group Havas and utility Compagnie Generale des Eaux said after close they would launch a joint bid for film production studio SFP, which is being privatised.</p>
<p>*Club Med said after close it expects its pre-tax, pre-exceptional profit for second half 1995/96 similar to level of a year earlier; clients seek less costly packages and extra commercial costs failed to generate sufficient rise in volumes.  </p>
<p>*Eramet nickel mining company weak again on continued fears about ownership of a disputed nickel mine in northern New Caledonia.</p>
<p>*Eurotunnel a touch higher. Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator said after close in Paris 657 jobs will be shed out of 3,500 in wider reorganisation which would save 32 million stg this year, of which 16 million stg would come off the salary bill.</p>
