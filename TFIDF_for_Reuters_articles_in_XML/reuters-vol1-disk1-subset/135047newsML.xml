<text>
<p>Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday that credit standings at major Czech banks would stabilise despite a high number of bad loans.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite their significant number of troubled loans, the largest Czech banks should grow increasingly stable,&quot; a Moody's report said.</p>
<p>Moody's said the credit standing of the four largest banks was looking steady.</p>
<p>But the small bank sector, which underwent rapid expansion in the early 1990s and whose problems are less historic, should continue to undergo adjustment now, it said.  </p>
<p>Also, according to the rating agency, the recent troubles in the market, the problems at the small banks, plus the liquidity stress suffered by Agrobanka -- the fifth largest bank, paradoxically should have positive benefits for the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Most visibly, the reaction to the troubles demonstrate that the Central Bank will support the system,&quot; Moody's said.</p>
<p>It said the troubles should help to accelerate consolidation of the system, and lead to further rationalisation of the banking system by putting the spotlight on the need for better regulation and oversight of the capital markets and better transparency and disclosure.  </p>
<p>Overall, despite weaknesses, the position of the large Czech banks should continue to stabilise, Moodys's said.</p>
<p>The banks were gradually broadening their skill bases, deepening their service capabilities, and modernising their management information systems.</p>
<p>The large banks held major shares of the Czech market, and were of substantial size in emerging market terms. The solvency of the large banks -- modestly above the minimum eight percent levels at present -- had been rising slowly on a year-to-year basis, and solvency should continue to improve as a result of the progressive privatisation of the system.  </p>
<p>Moody's noted that the seriousness of the substandard lending and the degree of its occurrence remained very high, but the banks had adopted a uniform loan-quality-classification system and provisioning methodology. Profitability has been improving, although it remains moderate, in part because of stubbornly high provisioning expenses.</p>
<p>Moody's pointed out, however, that notwithstanding the positive trends, the transition to a market-based economy is not complete, and this could have additional ramifications for the banks by adding to problem loans, and by causing profitability to slip from time to time.</p>
<p>The high level of problem loans was likely to recede only gradually, as the enterprise sector continues to restructure, the report said.</p>
<p>Moody's said it expected the government to be especially supportive of the large banks, and to provide assistance to them if necessary because they were so vital to the financial infrastructure and the continued transformation of the economic system.</p>
