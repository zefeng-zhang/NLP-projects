<p>The expansion of a southern African trade grouping should increase competition among sugar suppliers and reduce local prices, the general manager of Swaziland Sugar Association said on Tuesday. Negotiations are underway to draw together two regional groupings, which would raise competition to take advantage of the high prices in South Africa's domestic sugar market, said Andrew Colhoun in a prepared speech for a seminar hosted by the International Sugar Organization (ISO).</p>
<p>The groupings are the Southern African Common Customs Union (SACCU) and the South African Development Community (SADC).</p>
<p>SACCU has Swaziland, South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and Namibia as members, while SADC's members are the SACCU countries plus Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Malawi, Angola, Mozambique and Mauritius.</p>
<p>SADC had a number of actual or potential low cost sugar producers such as South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique and Mauritius, he said, adding that they would be attracted by high domestic prices in South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for sugar producers with SADC/SACCU during the next five years is for increased price competition as the regional producers fight for a share of the high-priced SACCU market leading to a gradual price reduction and the disappearance of marginal producers,&quot; Colhoun said.</p>
<p>Domestic prices within SACCU are considerable higher than the world price and attract sugar from outside the Common Customs Union, he said.</p>
<p>Sugar was already entering SACCU through members of SADC and with the expected convergence of the two groupings it would be extremely difficult to prevent the flow of sugar into other non-SACCU countries, Colhoun added.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall trend will be to reduce prices in the region due to the competition from lower price producers both within inside and outside SACCU.&quot;</p>
