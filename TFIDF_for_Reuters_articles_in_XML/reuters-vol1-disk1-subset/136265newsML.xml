<p>London cocoa futures crept up at Wednesday's close on light trade and industry buying as sterling stepped down from the peaks.</p>
<p>Traders said a weaker sterling in currency markets eased pressure from origins and attracted some industry offtake against a background of improving technical sentiment after failure to dip below 975..</p>
<p>But volume was considered mediocre at a total 2,769 lots. &quot;Sterling fell back a bit so there is less hedging pressure but there is hardly anything convincing,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The benchmark March erased losses incurred in early session and clawed higher to end four stg up on the day at 989 stg while front-month December rose three stg to end at 960.</p>
<p>Traders were getting impatient with Ivorian arrivals with no headlines on Wednesday as to when the season would start.</p>
<p>The Commodity Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said earlier this week that the official season would begin on Wednesday or Thursday. But farm and freight rates are yet to be fixed.</p>
<p>Switches were steady with Dec/March at 28 and 26 stg, March/May and May/July stood at 15 and 13.</p>
<p>March is expected to encounter stiff resistance at 1,000 stg before making headway toward the crucial 1,025 level. But support is strong at 975.</p>
