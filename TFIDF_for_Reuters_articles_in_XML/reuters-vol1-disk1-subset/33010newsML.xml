<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for the first time on Wednesday, PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat said.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting between President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu will be held today at 5:30 (1430 GMT),&quot; Erekat told reporters in Palestinian-ruled Gaza.  </p>
<p>Israel's Government Press Office confirmed the meeting would take place at 5.30 p.m. Officials on both sides said it would be held at the Erez border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had been struggling over the past week to find a formula that would enable the leaders to meet and for fully fledged peace talks to resume.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May on a vow to take a hardline in peace talks with the Palestinians, had said originally he preferred not to meet Arafat but softened his position in recent days.</p>
<p>Palestinians have been pressing for a summit and resumed talks to tackle the issue of Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron. The sides had been tussling over the wording of a document that would commit Israel to existing peace deals.</p>
