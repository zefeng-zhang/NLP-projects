<text>
<p>MANILA, Oct 21 (Reuter) _ The Philippines' benchmark 91-day treasury bill rate rose to an average of 11.531 percent at Monday's regular weekly auction from last week's 11.526, the Bureau of Treasury said.  </p>
<p>The 182-day bill likewise increased to an average of 12.009 percent from 11.930, and the 364-day bill moved up to 12.711 percent from 12.701.</p>
<p>The auction had tenders worth 7.866 billion pesos, of which 5.0 billion pesos were accepted.</p>
<p>Traders said the consistent monthly hike in the local prices of petroleum products pushed banks to submit higher bids. &quot;The market is wary. Seeing these cost-push factors for inflation, no one wanted to bid lower,&quot; a foreign bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Banks also believe interest rates may have bottomed out since the Central Bank has maintained its overnight lending rate at 13.0 percent and its borrowing rate at 11.0 percent even though inflation fell to 4.4 percent in September, traders said.</p>
<p>However, a drop in the Central Bank's overnight rates could spark further speculation in the foreign exchange rate, they said.  </p>
<p>Currently, banks are holding off from investing heavily in T-bills in anticipation of higher interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>The 364-day bills garnered bids worth 3.4564 billion pesos, of which 2.5 billion pesos were awarded. The 91-days, with a sales volume of 1.0 billion pesos, had 2.472 billion pesos of tenders.</p>
<p>The 182-day bills had 1.940 billion pesos of tenders for the 1.5 billion-peso offering.</p>
