<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine bonds rise, maintaining strong tone.</title>
<headline>Argentine bonds rise, maintaining strong tone.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>Argentine bonds were higher Wednesday as the stronger sentiment of late maintained its grip on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's mood is good,&quot; said a trader at a large foreign bank.</p>
<p>Traders said there was nothing specific expected this session but that the feeling was a greater push by government to get its economic policies passed in Congress is underway.</p>
<p>The meeting called by President Carlos Menem Thursday of the ruling Peronist Party is seen as a clear indication that the government is going to put more effort into persuading reluctant Congressmen to support the government line.</p>
<p>The 5.5 percent dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.20 to 116.30 while Argentina's FRB advanced 1/2 to 79-3/8.</p>
<p>An analyst at a large foreign bank said another issue in marks Wednesday after two bonds on Tuesday is also helping even though the issue only amounted to 75 million marks.</p>
<p>A crucial question for Argentine market watchers is whether the current rising budget deficit can be financed, so any new issuance is positive since it alleviates the pressure on fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Argentina sold a seven year FRB linked bond with a 11 percent coupon at a price of 99.75.</p>
