<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani criticised the United States on Wednesday for its cruise missile attacks against Iraq but said the Iraqis had provided the pretext.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans are moving wrong in Iraq and the Iraqis have given them the pretext,&quot; Rafsanjani, speaking through an interpreter, told Reuters on the third day of a state visit to Kenya.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani called events in Iraq, Iran's western neighbour and a longstanding enemy, &quot;very bad incidents&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked whether there was anything he could do to avert further violence, the Iranian leader said: &quot;We are trying, but it is very difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. fired cruise missiles at Iraqi air defence targets on Tuesday and Wednesday in retaliation for Saturday's incursion by Iraqi armed forces into Kurdish areas in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani was speaking during a tour of an agricultural research station at Muguga, 40 km (25 miles) north of Nairobi.</p>
<p>After leaving Kenya on Thursday, Rafsanjani is due to visit Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Sudan.</p>
<p>Western diplomats say the Iranian president is hoping to strengthen ties in Africa as part of Tehran's campaign to lessen its international isolation and the impact of U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>Washington accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism, a charge Iran denies.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Rafsanjani offered the hand of brotherhood to Africa instead of what he termed the raping of the continent by colonialists.</p>
<p>Speaking at Moslem prayers in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, a gateway to much of East and central Africa, Rafsanjani said Western powers had &quot;raped the land in the name of civilisation&quot; when they colonised Africa.</p>
<p>At a dinner hosted by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on Monday, Rafsanjani urged Kenya to support a drive for the &quot;democratic restructuring&quot; of the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;The rich countries are using the United Nations as an instrument to pursue their own political objectives,&quot; he said.</p>
