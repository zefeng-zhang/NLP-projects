<p>Packing 145 mph (235 kmph) winds, Hurricane Edouard pushed across the Atlantic on Sunday, but forecasters said it was still too far from land to predict where the dangerous storm might strike.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the centre of Edouard was located 850 miles (1,365 km) west of the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, or at latitude 16.1 north and longitude 41.0 west.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a dangerous hurricane,&quot; said National Hurricane Centre forecaster Mike Hopkins. &quot;But it's still premature to speculate about where, or if, it will make landfall by mid-week.&quot;</p>
<p>Edouard, a compact and powerful storm, was swirling west- northwest at 14 mph (23 kmh).</p>
<p>Hurricane forecasters said computer models showed Edouard was likely to remain strong for at least the next three days, due to favourable conditions for hurricanes in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&quot;On its current course, it could miss the Caribbean islands, but we just can't make any predictions yet,&quot; Hopkins said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tropical depression number six began falling apart off the west coast of Africa and forecasters said it was unlikely to pose any danger. At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the depression was located about 650 miles west (1,045 km) of the Cape Verde Islands with winds of 35 mph (55 kph).</p>
<p>The rapid organisation of the storm's eyewall and intensity of its winds made forecasters declare Edouard a Category 4 hurricane -- a dangerous storm capable of massive destruction. Hurricane forecasters rank storms in five categories, according to wind speed.</p>
<p>Four years ago on Aug. 24, another Category 4 storm, Hurricane Andrew, slammed into south Florida and caused more than $20 billion worth of damage and left 250,000 people homeless.</p>
