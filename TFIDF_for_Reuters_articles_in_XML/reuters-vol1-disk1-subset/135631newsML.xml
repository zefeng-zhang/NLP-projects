<title>RUSSIA: Gazprom jumps in lethargic Russian stocks.</title>

<p>Shares in Gazprom jumped over eight percent on Tuesday in an otherwise lethargic Russian share market after Gazprom announced the pricing of its American Depositary shares, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0910 GMT Gazprom was traded at $0.521 after $0.480 at Monday's close.</p>
<p>The ADS's, equal to 10 ordinary shares, were priced at $15.75.</p>
<p>But dealers said the two segments were separate, and there was no direct link between the two markets.</p>
<p>Gazprom's ADS pricing did not have an impact on its price on the Russian market as foreign and domestic markets in the share are strictly divided, said Alexei Malyshev, head of securities at Gambit-Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom will not rise to its price on the international markets in the near future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russian operators had practically no access to Gazprom's international market, while foreign investors could not trade on the domestic markets, he said.</p>
<p>Otherwise leading shares slipped in early trade on Tuesday, but then started edging up in lethargic trading.</p>
<p>At 0910 GMT Mosenergo was traded at $0.977 after $0.978 at Monday's close, Norilsk Nickel rose to $6.41 from $6.39, Rostelekom edged down to $2.65 from $2.68 and Surgutneftegaz, the most heavily traded share, was $0.432 after $0.429.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is lazy, foreign investors do not show much interest, as those with portfolios are ready to wait, and those without good portfolios are waiting for lower prices or good corporate news,&quot; said Alexander Bubnovsky, sales director at Alfa-Kapital.</p>
<p>Alexei Malyshev, head of the stock department at Gambit-Securities, forecast that the market would rise on Tueday, but would fall for the rest of the week.</p>
