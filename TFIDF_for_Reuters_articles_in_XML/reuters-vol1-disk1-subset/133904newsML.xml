<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the largest municipal utility in the U.S., has resigned, a department spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>William McCarley, general manager of LADWP, said in a letter to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan he would leave the position as of February 1, 1997.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles city council last week vetoed proposed  pay increases for several city managers, including McCarley.  </p>
<p>McCarley's letter said coming deregulation of the electric utility industry called for a &quot;radically new approach&quot; to the &quot;management, operation, financial practices and oversight,&quot; of the utility.</p>
<p>But several City Hall insiders said McCarley told them he was quitting over the salary issue, the Los Angeles Times reported today.</p>
<p>The LADWP spokesman declined to comment on the report. McCarley was out of town and could not be reached for comment.  </p>
<p>LADWP, which serves 1.3 million customers, has sought to improve efficiency, including cutting its workforce by 20 percent in the last two years, amid increased competition in the industry.</p>
<p>McCarley said earlier this year that the muncipal utility was seeking a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; with a major energy company like Enron, Duke/Louis Dreyfus or PacifiCorp as part of this restructuring.</p>
<p>McCarley also reportedly said he was looking into a charter amendment to allow the utility to take on more business activities, broaden its investment and restructure debt.  </p>
<p>In September, LADWP announced plans to trim rates for large industrial customers.</p>
<p>The municipal utility's board said the rate restructuring would result in lower electricity bills for 70 percent of those customers.</p>
<p>Under the plan, about 20 percent of LADWP's business customers would see rate increases of below five percent.</p>
<p>Most of the customers scheduled for rate increases are smaller users who have not been paying their share of the electric system's cost, Carolyn Green, president of the LADWP board said at the time the plan was announced.  </p>
<p>The plan still needs approval from the City Council and Mayor.</p>
