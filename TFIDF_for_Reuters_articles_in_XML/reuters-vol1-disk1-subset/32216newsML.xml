<p>Heavy fund selling pushed frozen concentrated orange juice futures sharply lower for the second consecutive session, but the moves were due to chart based factors, traders said.</p>
<p>Floor sources and traders said no fundamental reason lay behind the second tumble in as many days. November FCOJ plunged more than six cents on Tuesday because there were no buy orders under the market as speculators and funds sold heavily.</p>
<p>The market remained slightly higher during Wednesday's morning session, but from about midday heavy follow-through fund and speculative selling resumed, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was all based on technicals,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>November juice settled 1.90 cents lower at 105.20 cents per pound, traded 109.25 to 104.50 cents.</p>
<p>Support for November was pegged at 103.85 cents and then 100.15 cents.</p>
<p>On Wednesday some dealers noted that hurricanes approaching southeast United States were avoiding the orange growing regions of Florida.</p>
