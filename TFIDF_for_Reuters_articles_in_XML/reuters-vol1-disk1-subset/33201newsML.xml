<headline>Sulzer breaks down outlook by division.</headline>
<dateline>WINTERTHUR, Switzerland 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sulzer AG said on Wednesday it expected a 1996 operating loss from its Sulzer Rueti weaving machinery division although Sulzer as a whole expects higher net and operating income this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Sulzer Rueti is still combating adverse market conditions and the losses are expected to be higher than last year,&quot; Sulzer chief executive Fritz Fahrni said at a news conference.</p>
<p>He said reorganisation measures and personnel reductions were still under way at the division and would be intensified. But the measures were not expected to bear fruit until 1997.</p>
<p>Fahrni also said setbacks had occurred in the Sulzer Winterthur locomotive and turbine division and as a result the group's operating income was expected to decline slightly.</p>
<p>Operating income increases were expected at the Sulzermedica medical products division and the Sulzer Infra plant and building services division would contribute to reducing losses, Fahrni also said.</p>
