<text>
<p>Taiwanese tycoon Kao Ching-yuan on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if relations remained at a low ebb due to ideological differences.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment,&quot; Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, the island's biggest investor in China, told a seminar in Beijing.  </p>
<p>The talks were suspended last year after President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States.</p>
<p>Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>Kao warned that it would be riskier for Taiwanese businessmen to invest in China and investors would lose confidence in the mainland if political or ideological disputes continued to hamper ties between Beijing and Taipei.</p>
<p>Nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians, led by Kao, arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile, 12-day visit. Taiwan's leaders have publicly expressed reservations about the island becoming too dependent on China economically.</p>
