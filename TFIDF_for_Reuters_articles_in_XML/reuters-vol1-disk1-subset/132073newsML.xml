<p>Indonesian President Suharto has called for peaceful general elections next year that would strengthen national unity rather than bruise society, the official Antara news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that the election would not leave bruises in the heart of any group of people or any layer of society,&quot; Suharto, who is also chairman of the board of patrons of the ruling Golkar party, said on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Speaking at Golkar's 32nd anniversary celebrations, Suharto said the elections should be competitive as it was natural for contestants to try and get as many votes as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;But competition has to be carried out within the corridor of political ethics and regulations,&quot; Suharto said.</p>
<p>Besides Golkar, Indonesia's tightly-controlled electoral system allows only the Moslem-orientated United Development Party (PPP) and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to contest elections.</p>
<p>The polls, which will send 425 people to fill the elective seats in the 500-member parliament or DPR, are due to be held in late May next year. The remaining 75 seats will be filled by appointed members of the military.</p>
<p>Indonesia's best-known opposition figure, Megawati Sukarnoputri, will not be contesting the elections.</p>
<p>The daughter of late founding president Sukarno, she was ousted from the leadership of the PDI by a government-backed faction in what political analysts have said was a move to sideline her before she could cut into Golkar's vote.</p>
<p>The organisation which oversees the election has refused to accept her list of candidates although Megawati has filed a lawsuit seeking redress.</p>
<p>Golkar Chairman Harmoko, who is also information minister, told the celebration that the party had set a target of 70.02 percent of the vote for the poll.</p>
<p>Golkar has won all five elections held during the 30-year period under Suharto's rule, known as the New Order administration. In 1992, it took 68 percent of the vote, from the 73 percent it won at the 1987 poll.</p>
<p>The general election will be followed by the March 1998 presidential poll when the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), made up of the DPR and 500 presidential appointees, is expected to elect Suharto for a seventh five-year term.</p>
<p>Golkar stopped short of nominating Suharto during its recent annual conference although it has strongly suggested he is best qualified for the job.</p>
<p>The Merdeka newspaper on Monday listed the nine qualities of the next president as stated by Golkar.</p>
<p>It said the president should be someone who is patriotic and believes in God, has vision and an ability to unite the nation. The person should be a statesman and wise as well as brave enough to make difficult decisions, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that any candidate should also have a proven record and be acceptable to the people. The next president should be a leader who has consistently implemented the programmes of the New Order administration, a supporter of national development and a person with ability recognised both home and abroad.</p>
<p>Golkar has also said age need not be a factor in deciding on a candidate.</p>
<p>Suharto, 75, has ruled Indonesia since the 1960s.</p>
