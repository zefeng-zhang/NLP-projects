<p>Argentine soccer idol Diego Maradona threatened on Wednesday to reveal &quot;dark political and economic interests&quot; behind the arrest of his manager on drug-dealing charges if the courts do not find him innocent.</p>
<p>In an open letter published in the Argentine press, the 1986 World Cup hero who admits his own cocaine habit, vowed that if Guillermo Coppola is jailed, &quot;I will head a campaign to make all those responsible for this injustice pay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guillermo Coppola has nothing to do with the charges made against him and behind this are hidden dark political and economic interests I will eventually reveal,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>Maradona's bronzed, silver-haired 49-year-old manager was arrested two weeks ago, along with Maradona's brother-in-law Gabriel Esposito, ex-soccer international Alberto Tarantini and others, after police found a pound (500 grams) of cocaine in a flower pot at Coppola's luxury Buenos Aires apartment.</p>
<p>Coppola says the drugs were planted. He told Judge Hernan Bernasconi that after he left his home for the last time during a late party the Saturday before the raid, Maradona and three women carried on partying there until Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Maradona has to give evidence next week, though Bernasconi has ruled he can make his declarations in Buenos Aires rather than travel to the courthouse in Dolores south of the capital.</p>
<p>The case is giving ordinary Argentines a glimpse into the sleazy lifestyle of a jet set where politicians, models and sports stars party with drug dealers and prostitutes.</p>
<p>Many blame Coppola for Maradona's cocaine habit, which put him in a Swiss clinic for 10 days last month. Days later he went beserk in a Spanish hotel and smashed up the lobby.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old who was once the world's most expensive player has not turned out for Buenos Aires team Boca Juniors since August. He is desperately fond of Coppola, who was up on drug charges in Italy while managing Maradona's Naples career.</p>
<p>Even the father of Claudia, Diego's wife and the mother of their two girls, defended Coppola. &quot;They want to make him look like the Medellin cartel,&quot; Coco Villafane told local radio.</p>
<p>Bernasconi, denying he was making exceptions for Maradona by letting him stay in Buenos Aires, said he had &quot;no grounds&quot; for alleging obscure hidden motives behind Coppola's arrest.</p>
<p>In fact, the case is embarrassing the government. Coppola was a visitor to President Carlos Menem's Olivos residence with Maradona and was a friend of Menem's late son Carlitos and Menem's private secretary Ramon Hernandez.</p>
<p>As speculation rose about who among the jet set would be collared next, Bernasconi said &quot;being at a party or visiting a friend doesn't make anyone a suspect: there is only one suspect here -- Coppola.&quot;</p>
