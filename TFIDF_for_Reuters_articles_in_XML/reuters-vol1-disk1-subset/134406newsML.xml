<headline>Duke Power says Q3 affected by weather.</headline>
<dateline>CHARLOTTE, N.C. 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Duke Power Co. said on Tuesday its drop in earnings for the 1996 third quarter stemmed from mild weather and unexpected costs related to Hurricane Fran in September.</p>
<p>The utility company said it paid $13.2 million to cleanup after Hurricane Fran.</p>
<p>&quot;Milder weather for the quarter, especially in August, led to lower overall sales,&quot; said Richard Osborne, chief financial officer. &quot;That, plus costs associated with Hurricane Fran and a decline in income at Duke's subsidiary companies, were key drivers for the quarter.&quot;  </p>
<p>Duke Power said total retail sales were down 1.2 percent for the quarter. Residential sales were down 1.7 percent, but general service or commercial sales were up 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather had the most impact on residential sales,&quot; Osborne said. &quot;However, we were pleased to see that commercial and other industrial sales continue to grow.&quot;</p>
<p>Industrial sales overall were up slightly at 0.9 percent. The only slippage was in textile sales, down 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>During the quarter, Duke Power experienced the force of Hurricane Fran throughout its service territory, affecting power to almost 400,000 customers early in September.</p>
