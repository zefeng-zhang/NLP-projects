<p>Turkey is planning the creation of a security cordon inside northern Iraq to curtail increasing Kurdish separatist activity along the porous border between the two countries, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;You call it what you like...It is question of five or 10 kilometres,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman said, when asked how deep the security cordon would go. He said Turkey had asked the United States about the plan, but had not yet received a reply.  </p>
<p>Foreign Minster Tansu ciller had earlier said Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas fighting the Turkish army from bases in northern Iraq had massed on the border, prompting Turkey to take the &quot;necessary measures&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment there is no question of us constantly sending soldiers there. But this does not mean that we are not going to intervene tomorrow and station soldiers there,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said Turkey did not plan on challenging Iraq's sovereignty or take over the area. Ankara had informed Baghdad and local Iraqi Kurdish groups of its intentions and wanted to pursue its plans in coordination with local groups.</p>
<p>Turkey has long been talking about increasing security of its long border with Iraq, by buying in electronic monitoring systems or permanently increasing troops in the area. It has also mentioned a security cordon in Iraq in the past, but these plans have never been realised.</p>
<p>Turkey's army mounted a large-scale incursion into northern Iraq in pursuit of PKK guerrillas in the spring of 1995. They later withdrew.</p>
