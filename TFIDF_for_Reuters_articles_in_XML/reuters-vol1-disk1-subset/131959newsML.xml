<p>Gold bullion is likely to remain cheaper in Tokyo than in London, centre of the global trade, at least until the end of the year, as a fall in local jewellery sales and higher output by local smelters has left Japan awash with bullion, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>They added that this highly unusual discount in the Tokyo market may force some gold dealers to re-export gold and swallow shipping costs to Europe of around 50 to 60 cents per ounce.  </p>
<p>Japan's spot bullion prices have already languished at flat to 30 cents an ounce below loco London, on a C and F basis, for more than a month, and activity on the Tokyo gold market has slowed to a trickle.</p>
<p>Traders said jewellery manufacturers will be able to meet a large part of their needs for the busy Christmas season from stocks built up during the year's protracted jewellery slump.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold demand from the jewellery sector usually rises around this time of year ahead of the year-end gift-giving season, but we haven't seen any fresh demand,&quot; a trading house trader said. Bullion prices have been pressured from the supply side too.  </p>
<p>Japanese smelters' gold output jumped 13.4 percent in the first eight months of this year to 83.49 tonnes, according to the Japan Mining Industry Association.</p>
<p>An official at the industry body attributed the rise to higher output of refined copper. Copper refining yields small amounts of gold contained in the ore as a by-product.</p>
<p>This trend was also reflected in Japan's trade statistics, which showed a surge in recent months in imports of ore concentrates containing copper and low levels of gold.  </p>
<p>&quot;Higher output of domestic gold has obviously weighed on the local bullion market. Japanese copper smelters are believed to have boosted production to take advantage of high smelting charges,&quot; an official of a bullion house said.</p>
<p>Some market sources said Japanese traders may be forced to re-export gold if the current supply surplus and the weaker local bullion price continue, although this would be a last resort, given high shipping costs.</p>
<p>The primary hope for a bounce in premiums will come when the Tokyo Commodity Exchange's December gold futures contract expires in late December.  </p>
<p>At this time, trade houses holding short positions may be forced to buy gold in the Tokyo spot market to meet delivery requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;If private investors who hold massive long positions in the December contract take deliveries at the expiry, gold bullion prices could rebound temporarily,&quot; one trader said. -- Tokyo Commodities Desk +81-3-3432-7431</p>
