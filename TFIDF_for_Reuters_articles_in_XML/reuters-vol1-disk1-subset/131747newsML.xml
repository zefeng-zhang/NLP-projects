<p>Nigeria's military government said on Monday that it was seriously considering selling its oil joint ventures and privatising its refineries.</p>
<p>&quot;Privatisation will open our economy up for the foreign investment we very much need,&quot; Finance Minister Anthony Ani told a seminar in Lagos on attracting foreign investors to Sub-Saharan Africa's biggest economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Government is giving serious consideration to selling its 57 percent equity shares in these (oil joint venture) projects to private investors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nigeria's oil industry, the country's economic engine, is currently run by multinational oil companies in joint ventures with state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.</p>
<p>Among the multinationals are Royal Dutch Shell Group, Mobil, Chevron Corp and Texaco of the United States, France's Elf-Aquitaine and Agip SpA.</p>
<p>&quot;Government also intends to privatise the refineries after an evaluation of the current value of each of them,&quot; Ani said.</p>
<p>Nigeria's four refineries run at a fraction of their combined output capacity of 445,000 barrels per day because of poor management and fraud.</p>
<p>Ani said the government was willing to grant licences to competent private investors to set up export-oriented refineries in the country.</p>
<p>Industry experts say that if properly run, Nigerian refineries could supply the West and Central African markets.</p>
<p>They said Nigeria's privatisation of its oil industry would be worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil reserves, gas reserves and all that are worth more than $50 billion and would have tremendous impact on our local stock exchange as well as the entire economy,&quot; said banker Toye Badmus at the seminar.</p>
<p>The World Bank and the private sector have long been urging Nigeria to revive its economy by privatising key sectors such as electricity, petroleum and telecommunications.</p>
<p>The government has already announced that it will privatise the National Electric Power Authority and Nigeria Telecommunications next year.</p>
<p>Nigeria's economy is one of Africa's biggest but has been bedevilled by political instability, foreign debt of more than $32 billion and long term falling income from its main export, crude oil.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to attract a high level of foreign investment to be able to boost production levels that bring down prices of goods and services and as things are in the world today, it is only by privatisation that we can achieve this,&quot; Ani said.</p>
<p>The seminar is organised by Nigerian-owned Diamond Bank and the Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency, an affiliate of the World Bank.</p>
<p>Key measures taken by Nigeria in the last 18 months such as free trading in naira, unhindered repatration of profits have not attracted much foreign investments to a country that fell into political chaos in 1993 when an election to restore democracy was voided by the army.</p>
