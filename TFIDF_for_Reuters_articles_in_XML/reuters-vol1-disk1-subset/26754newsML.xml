<title>USA: BASEBALL-RODRIGUEZ HOMER LIFTS SEATTLE PAST BALTIMORE.</title>
<headline>BASEBALL-RODRIGUEZ HOMER LIFTS SEATTLE PAST BALTIMORE.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1996-09-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Alex Rodriguez, flattered that Baltimore manager Dave Johnson asked for his bat to be checked, smacked a three-run homer to break a fifth-inning tie and help the Seattle Mariners beat he Orioles 5-1 Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I thought it was very flattering,&quot; said Rodriguez, who uses Ken Griffey Jr's bats. &quot;A shortstop with a corked bat? It's pretty sweet. But I just grabbed another one of Junior's. I've been using them all year.&quot;</p>
<p>Seattle manager Lou Piniella had asked for Bobby Bonilla's bat to be confiscated after his fourth-inning single.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't want to let him hit with it, so I might as well take it out of his hands,&quot; said Johnson about why he asked home plate umpire Ted Barrett to confiscate Rodriguez's bat for X-rays as the shortstop approached the plate. &quot;It didn't affect much of anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Not that I thought it was altered in any thing or any way, it's just that if you take one of my guys' bats, I'm going to take one of your guys' bats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could care less, that's why I got six dozen,&quot; said Griffey.&quot;</p>
<p>Rodriguez, who extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a third-inning double, is 33-for-68 (.485) during that span. The double gave him the major-league lead with 49, one more than teammate Edgar Martinez.</p>
<p>Terry Mulholland (3-1) over 6 1/3 innings allowed one run, seven hits, walked three and struck out two for Seattle, which split the four-game series and won for the fifth time in seven games. Norm Chartlon and Mike Jackson combined for 2 2/3 scoreless innings.</p>
<p>David Wells (10-13) was reached for four runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Bonilla hit his 23rd homer for Baltimore, which stayed four games behind the Yankees in the American League East, one game behind Chicago in the wild-card race and one ahead of Seattle.</p>
<p>At California, Chuck Finley and two relievers combined on a four-hitter and Tim Salmon hit a three-run homer as the Angels defeated the struggling New York Yankees 4-0.</p>
<p>Finley (13-13) scattered four hits in 7 1/3 innings with four walks and nine strikeouts. The veteran left-hander has won all four of his starts against the Yankees this season.</p>
<p>Mike James made just one pitch and got Cecil Fielder to ground into a double play to end the eighth. Troy Percival worked the ninth.</p>
<p>The Yankees have lost six of their last eight games and 11 of 17 and are just 24-27 since the All-Star break.</p>
<p>The Angels scored all of their runs in the third off Kenny Rogers (10-8).</p>
<p>In Oakland, Aaron Sele pitched six scoreless innings and Jeff Frye, Mike Greenwell and rookie Nomar Garciaparra each drove in a pair of runs to lead the Boston Red Sox to an 8-3 victory over the Athletics.</p>
<p>Sele (6-9), activated off the disabled list for the game, scattered four hits, walked none and struck out three.</p>
<p>Five relievers finished up for the Red Sox, who snapped a two-game skid and have won 10 of their last 13.</p>
<p>Garciaparra, making his first career start, homered for his first major-league hit.</p>
<p>At Texas, Julio Franco's fifth-inning grand slam capped a five-run fifth inning and Charles Nagy allowed one run over 7 2/3 innings as the Cleveland Indians decked the Rangers 8-2.</p>
<p>Nagy (14-4) gave up seven hits, walked three and struck out eight for Cleveland, which salvaged the final game of the three-game series. The Indians won only four of 12 games between the teams this season.</p>
<p>Cleveland's Kevin Seitzer, acquired from Milwaukee Saturday, went 4-for-5. Sandy Alomar homered for Cleveland.</p>
<p>Will Clark homered for Texas.</p>
<p>In Toronto, the Chicago White Sox scored three runs without a hit in the top of the 11th off reliever Paul Spoljaric (2-1) on two walks, a wild pitch, a hit batsman, an error, another wild pitch and a sacrifice fly to complete a three-game sweep of the Blue Jays, 4-2.</p>
<p>Roberto Hernandez (6-1) pitched two innings to get the win, despite allowing Shawn Green an RBI single in the 11th.</p>
<p>Chicago, which managed only five hits off three Toronto pitchers, won its fourth straight.</p>
<p>Danny Tartabull's 20th homer gave the White Sox four players with 20 homers for the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1987.</p>
<p>Toronto starter Juan Guzman fanned three and lowered his league-leading ERA to 2.93.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Tom Goodwin's single with two outs in the top of the 13th scored Jose Offerman and lifted the Kansas City Royals to a 3-2 victory over the Tigers.</p>
<p>Royals starter Chris Haney had a two-hit shutout going into the ninth, but closer Jeff Montgomery allowed a game-tying two-run homer to Travis Fryman.</p>
<p>In Milwaukee, Rich Becker (6-7) homered and drove in three runs and Scott Aldred scattered nine hits over eight innings to lead the Minnesota Twins to a 6-2 win over Brewers.</p>
<p>Chuck Knoblauch led off the game with a homer for Minnesota. Jeff Cirillo and Matt Mieske homered for Milwaukee.</p>
