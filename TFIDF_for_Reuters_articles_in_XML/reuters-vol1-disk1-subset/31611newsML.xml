<p>Chechen separatist rebels, applying strict Islamic law, carried out judicial beatings for drunks on Wednesday as they tightened their grip on the regional capital.</p>
<p>After a brief recitation of the crime and sentence, a sweating, bearded fighter, draped in ammunition belts and wearing a headband carrying an excerpt from the Koran, brought down a short, stout club with a dull smack on the backs and legs of the first of five offenders.</p>
<p>Such beatings have become common practice in Grozny as the Moslem independence fighters stamp their mark on the city they seized from the Russian army in fierce fighting last month.</p>
<p>The five punished on Wednesday were beaten on a rough wooden bench in front of curious onlookers in the courtyard of the local headquarters of one of the joint Russian-Chechen police patrols established in the city under a ceasefire agreed by Kremlin envoy Alexander Lebed.</p>
<p>Each received 40 blows for being found drunk in a public place. Most squirmed and squealed, but clung to the bench as the baton rained down blows. But for the last man it was too much.</p>
<p>He shouted in pain and gradually wriggled off the bench.</p>
<p>His punishment was stopped so, his jailers said, he would not be humiliated before the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Sharia law is the most just law,&quot; said one Chechen fighter after the beatings. He refused to give his name, calling himself &quot;a son of Allah, a fighter for Islam and a son of the Caucasus&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I am punished because I have sinned and need to be punished,&quot; he quoted from a religious text.</p>
<p>Punishments under sharia law have been common in rebel-held villages but are a new phenomenon in Grozny.</p>
<p>The rebels have been tightening their grip on the capital, taking control of day-to-day matters.</p>
<p>Many local people now automatically head for the separatist forces' main headquarters in a central sports stadium to seek help and advice as they rebuild their homes and their lives after the fortnight of heavy fighting that broke out on August 6 when the rebels attacked Russian posts.</p>
<p>The agreement signed on Saturday by Kremlin envoy Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov provided for a joint commission to be set up by October 1 to monitor the pullout of troops and oversee the economic reconstruction of the region after nearly 21 months of war.</p>
<p>But it is vague about the political arrangements and the rebels are filling the power vacuum.</p>
<p>Several Chechens, unused to strict Moslem observances after seven decades of Soviet communist atheism, said their region was unlikely to become a stronghold of Islamic fundamentalism.</p>
<p>Application of sharia law in Grozny has so far been limited to beatings for drunkenness and sometimes theft.</p>
<p>The sale of alcohol has also been banned.</p>
<p>At least one Chechen fighter, however, said he wanted sharia law extended. &quot;If someone kills or rapes then that person will be killed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers watching the beatings on Wednesday seemed bemused by what they were witnessing but accepted it.</p>
<p>&quot;Seeing it for the first time it looks mad. But it's normal, it's the only way to get rid of and punish alcoholism,&quot; said Lieutenant Nikolai Kotosonov.</p>
<p>Others seemed to agree with the need for tough laws after the disruptions caused by war and rebellion.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather starve to death than sell alcohol,&quot; said one woman trader at a row of roadside stalls. &quot;Of course, I will live under sharia. It will bring law and order.&quot;</p>
