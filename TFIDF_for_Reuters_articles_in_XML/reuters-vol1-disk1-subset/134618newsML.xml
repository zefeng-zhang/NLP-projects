<headline>Mahatma Gandhi's letters go on sale in London.</headline>

<p>A collection of writings by Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi, which were stashed in a cupboard in Madras for nearly 50 years, are to be sold in London, auction house Phillips said on Monday.</p>
<p>Many of the 450 handwritten papers are scrawled on the backs of envelopes or old letters by the environment-conscious leader.</p>
<p>They include many of the speeches Ghandi made in the six months before he was assassinated in 1948.</p>
<p>There are also letters written to Britain's wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, and to Louis Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India before independence in 1947.</p>
<p>Ghandi's former secretary, V. Kalyanam, kept the writings in his home and is now selling them to raise money for a Hindu charity, which wants to build a new temple. They are expected to raise up to one million pounds ($1.60 million).</p>
<p>The documents include a letter to Mountbatten in which Ghandi, who led 350 million Indians in a non-violent campaign against British rule, made clear his opposition to the division of India.</p>
<p>&quot;I pointed out the initial mistake of the British being party to splitting India into two,&quot; Gandhi wrote.</p>
<p>But he added magnanimously: &quot;It is not possible to undo the mistake. The very admirable doctrine of fair play...demands that I do not help the mistaken party to fancy that the mistake was no mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>A Phillips spokesman described the archive as &quot;extraordinary.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to over-emphasise the importance of something so central to the 20th century,&quot; he said.</p>
