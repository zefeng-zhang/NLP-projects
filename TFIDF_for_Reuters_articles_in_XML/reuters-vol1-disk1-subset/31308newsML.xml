<p>France's economy shrank 0.4 percent in the second quarter from the previous period, highlighting the government's difficulties in cutting the budget deficit ahead of European monetary union, data released Wednesday showed.</p>
<p>National statistics institute INSEE, which revised first-quarter growth downward to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent, said the fall was partly due to a drop in consumer spending and the fact that there were fewer working days in the period.</p>
<p>Economists had expected a fall of 0.2 to 0.4 percent after a sharp rebound in the first quarter as the economy recovered from a paralysing public sector strike at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Consumer spending, hit by high unemployment, fell 1.0 percent in the second quarter after rising 2.5 percent in the first and contributed 0.6 percentage points to the shrinkage in gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Economists said the second quarter figures were slightly disappointing and underlined the difficulties the government facted in reducing France's budget deficit to 4 percent of GDP this year and 3 percent next year from 5 percent last year in preparation for European monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;This is quite alarming. Clearly this is going to weigh on the deficit problem,&quot; Credit Lyonnais economist Iain Lindsay told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>The government, due to present a budget for 1997 later this month that will cut both spending and taxes, is counting on a recovery in the second half to help it meet its deficit reduction targets. It expects full-year growth of 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said they still expected a rebound in the third quarter, driven by a rise in consumer spending as people flock to buy new cars ahead of the expiry of a government incentive programme at the end of September.</p>
