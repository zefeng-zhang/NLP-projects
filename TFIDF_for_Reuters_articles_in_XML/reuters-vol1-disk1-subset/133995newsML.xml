<title>USA: Pentagon expands Gulf War chemical probe.</title>

<p>The Pentagon is notifying about 20,000 U.S. Gulf War troops that they may have been exposed to chemical weapons in the 1991 destruction of an Iraqi ammunition dump, defence officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Announcement of the notification, expected later in the day, would vastly expand the search for possible victims. The military said last month it was notifying 5,000 troops that they could have suffered exposure during destruction of the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern Iraq.  </p>
<p>The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the search was being expanded to include an area 30 miles (50 km) from the Kamisiyah site, where a huge white blast cloud may have drifted from exploded shells and rockets containing the chemical nerve agents Sarin and Cyclosarin.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has repeatedly denied any attempt to cover up possible exposure of U.S. troops to chemical agents in the war and has said there is no evidence either of U.S. deaths or injuries from such agents or that Iraq used them against U.S.-led coalition forces.</p>
<p>At the same time, the figure on possible exposure from the destruction of Kamisiyah by U.S. military engineers in March 1991 has grown steadily from 150 announced by the Defense Department in June.</p>
<p>In a step that could further expand the number of possible exposures, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department are working on a computer model to estimate the dispersion of the chemical cloud.</p>
