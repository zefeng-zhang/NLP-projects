<p>South Carolina Gov. David Beasley on Wednesday urged voluntary relocation of all residents and tourists on barrier islands and beach front property along the coast in anticipation of Hurricane Fran.</p>
<p>Calling Fran a &quot;relentless adversary,&quot; Beasley also urged those living in low-lying areas on or near the coast from Little River south to voluntarily evacuate. Hurricane Fran was due to approach coastal South Carolina by mid-morning on Thursday, he said, after consulting with state emergency preparedness and weather service officials.  </p>
<p>&quot;At this time we do not believe that there are any areas of our coast excluded from potential serious damage,&quot; the governor said in a statement.</p>
<p>At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Fran was about 540 miles (869 km)  from Charleston, South Carolina, and National Hurricane Center forecasters predicted the storm might make landfall on Thursday. Hurricane-strength winds extended 85 miles (136 km).</p>
<p>A hurricane watch area extended from Sebastian Inlet near Vero Beach, Florida, to Little River Inlet at the border of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>&quot;This storm also has the potential to take a Hugo-like track though the inland counties of South Carolina,&quot; Beasley said, recalling the 1989 hurricane that ravaged the Charleston area.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, I urge residents of modular and mobile homes in particular to secure their homes and consider relocating to safer shelters,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The previous hurricanes Bertha and Edouard that spared South Carolina this year were no grounds to become complacent, Beasely said, emphasizing the size of Fran.</p>
<p>&quot;She is a relentless adversary and we must be prepared,&quot; he said in the statement.</p>
