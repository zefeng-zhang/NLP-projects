<p>Slovenia on Wednesday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for NATO expansion by 1999, the 50th anniversary of the 16-member alliance that this ex-Yugoslav republic wants to join.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Jelko Kacin said: &quot;I'm happy that President Clinton set the agenda for NATO enlargement. If new members are to be admitted by 1999, negotiations have to start by the middle of 1997 in order to give time for ratification of the membership agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>Kacin told Reuters by telephone that Slovenia was a frontrunner for full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, along with Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;President Clinton on September 30 signed a document promising financial help to Slovenia in order to improve its compatibility with NATO and thus placing it among the strongest candidates,&quot; Kacin said.</p>
<p>Kacin said Slovenia would be eligible for help, mainly for training, after a 90-day observation period to conclude by the end of December.</p>
<p>Clinton's announcement on Tuesday in a speech in Detroit, home to thousands of voters of East European stock, that he wanted the Atlantic Alliance to admit new members by 1999 was the first time he has publicly backed a target date.</p>
<p>He did not name any countries nor give a date for a heads of state summit next year to invite countries to start membership negotiations.</p>
<p>But he said the doors would stay open after the first new members were accepted.</p>
<p>Slovenia had managed to join the frontrunners by improving its relations and cooperation this year with Italy, Kacin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Slovenia has established very good defence cooperation with Rome and Budapest and can actively contribute to peace and stability in this part of Europe,&quot; Kacin said.</p>
<p>Slovenia had been embroiled in a diplomatic tussle with Italy until last May when Rome finally approved Slovenia's association agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p>Rome shifted its stance after Ljubljana pledged to liberalise real-estate laws within four years, thus allowing foreign nationals to buy property in the Alpine republic.</p>
<p>If Slovenia is accepted into NATO, it would be the first ex-Yugoslav republic to join the military alliance.</p>
