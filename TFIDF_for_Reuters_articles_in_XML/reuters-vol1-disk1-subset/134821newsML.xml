<p>Swiss shares ended lower in slow, low volume trading and dealers said the session was marked by a general lack of investor interest.</p>
<p>Investors seemed to be worried by the current high price levels and were waiting for shares to slip lower before coming into the market, the dealers said.</p>
<p>Disappointing Novartis nine-month sales also dampened sentiment.</p>
<p>The SMI index of leading shares down 12.9 points at 3,775.3 and the all-share SPI closed 7.04 points lower at 2,422.61.</p>
<p>Dealers said nine-month sales for Ciba, which will merge with Sandoz to form Novartis, were below expectations. Sandoz sales were judged to be more positive by the market.</p>
<p>Ciba's sales rose two percent, while Sandoz sales were eight percent higher.</p>
<p>Ciba registered shares eased 12 francs to 1,576. Sandoz slipped 11 to 1,484.</p>
<p>Roche certificates rose 10 francs to 9,650 and dealers reported shifting out of Novartis into Roche.</p>
<p>ABB, which reported a 24 percent nine-month profit rise, lost nine francs to end at 1,569. Dealers said the stock saw profit-taking despite the fact that results were at the high end of the range of expectations.</p>
<p>Profit-taking was also reported in Nestle, which closed seven francs lower at 1,397.</p>
