<p>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said on Tuesday he had been in contact with Zairean government leaders but feared fighting between the army and ethnic Tutsis will deteriorate further.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a continuous deterioration of the situation on the ground not only for the refugees but also inside Zaire. And there is a real confrontation between Zaire and Rwanda,&quot; he told reporters after a Security Council session.</p>
<p>Asked what the United Nations could do about the crisis, he said, &quot;Let us be realistic, the only thing we can do is to offer our assistance. I don't believe we will be able to have observers or even a military presence on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are very much concerned by the situation in Zaire and on the border,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations had evacuated 58 aid workers trapped in eastern Zaire, some of them to Entebbe, Uganda. U.N. officials said other went to Goma and points in Zaire on two aircraft, one from the World Food Programme, the other from the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Zaire accuses Rwanda's Tutsi-led army of using the Banyamulenge, ethnic Tutsis who came from Rwanda in the late 18th century, to destabilise its eastern provinces. The Banyamulenge accuse Zaire of forcing them to leave.</p>
<p>The fighting has fuelled fears that the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry which triggered the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the equally bitter civil war in Burundi could engulf the whole Central African Great Lakes region.</p>
