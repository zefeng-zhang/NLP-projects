<p>Germany easily beat Poland 2-0 on Wednesday in a friendly, their first match since their European championship victory in June.</p>
<p>Oliver Birhoff, who scored a late equaliser and the winner against the Czechs in the Euro 96 final, headed in the game's first goal in the 28th minute from a floating centre pass by midfielder Christian Ziege.</p>
<p>The slow-paced match was dominated by the Germans, although the champions had to wait until the 89th minute for forward Juergen Klinsmann to put the game out of reach.</p>
<p>Klinsmann, who went unnoticed for most of the game, pounded Thomas Hessler's volley cross past Polish goalkeeper Maciej Szczesny from about six metres out, just minutes from full time.</p>
<p>Poland had few scoring opportunities in the match, the first between the neighbouring countries since 1981.</p>
<p>Their best chance came in the 70th minute when defender Marek Jozwiak dribbled in and took a high-angle shot right at goalkeeper Oliver Hahn.</p>
<p>Before the game Polish and German skinheads traded obscenities and threw pieces of broken benches at each other but police in riot gear, stationed between the two groups of fans, quickly intervened.</p>
