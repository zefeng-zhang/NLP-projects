<title>BELGIUM: Belgian Bel-20 set to notch up further gains.</title>

<p>The Bel-20 index held on to the bulk of its early gains on the back of Wall Street's jump Tuesday to gain 0.62 percent on Wednesday, and it should manage to climb further in the next few days, dealers said.</p>
<p>The index closed 10.58 points higher at 1,727.74 with 1.3 billion francs worth of Belgian shares traded.</p>
<p>The market was also underpinned by a calm reaction on most markets to the Iraqi crisis, by firm bonds and the prospect of a re-weighting of the Bel-20, effective from September 23.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be heading towards 1,750,&quot; said Stefan Casteleyn at Corluy &amp; Co.</p>
<p>He expected the index would hold on to the 1,750 area for some time. But further strong first-half earnings and low rates could lift the Bel-20 by up to another 100 points in the next six to 12 months, he said.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed newspaper reports on that holding GBL and affiliated companies were willing to sell their stake in utility Tractebel holding to SGB for 14,500 francs a share were not having a major impact on prices today, dealers said.</p>
<p>SGB added 0.8 percent to 2,420, GBL 0.5 percent to 3,860 and Tractebel 0.6 percent to 13,500 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;People think 'we'll see',&quot; Casteleyn said.</p>
<p>Holding Gevaert was the day's leading gainer with a 2.5 percent rise to 2,080 francs which dealers said was fuelled by stronger-than-expected first-half earnings last Friday.</p>
<p>Gevaert's first-half consolidated net profit more than doubled to 3.77 billion francs from 1.72 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Gevaert is a well-managed holding with a very strong potential for extra capital gains,&quot; Casteleyn said.</p>
<p>Bank BBL closed 1.0 percent up at 5,930 francs before announcing an 18-percent rise in first-half profit to 5.1 billion francs, which dealers said was entirely in line with expectations.</p>
