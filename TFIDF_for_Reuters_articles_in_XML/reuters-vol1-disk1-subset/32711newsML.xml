<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities slipped a third of a point in premium coupons on Wednesday while their yields narrowed moderately over comparable Treasuries.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, pass-throughs were off 9/32 to 11/32 in coupons of 7.0 percent or smaller, and were off 1/32 to 9/32 in current and premium coupons. The 10-year Treasury note was off 9/32 to yield 6.93 percent.</p>
<p>Fears of rising interest rates and concern the Iraq conflict could lead to higher oil prices drove some of the selling, fixed-income analysts said.  </p>
<p>Mixed data greeted the market Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The weekly BTM/Schroders chain store sales index rose 1.3 percent in the week ended August 31, against a 0.2 percent rise the previous week. And the Commerce Department said construction spending fell 1.4 percent in July after a 0.7 percent June rise.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, Ginnie Mae 30-year 8.0 percent coupons were off 7/32 at 99-31/32, yielding 114 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Comparable FNMAs were off 8/32 at 99-08/32, and FHLMCs were off 6/32 at 100-02/32.</p>
