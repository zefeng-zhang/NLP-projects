<p>The first shipment of Indonesia's controversial Timor national car made by Kia Motors Corp of South Korea arrived at Jakarta's Tanjung Priok port on Thursday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said workers began unloading the cars just before 2 p.m. (0700 GMT).</p>
<p>Japan has threatened to take Indonesia to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over its national car policy which allows only PT Timor Putra Nasional to import vehicles free of tariffs and luxury taxes imposed on other car makers.</p>
<p>Republika newspaper reported on Thursday that the shipment contained 2,000 vehicles which would be sold by PT Timor Putra Nasional, a joint venture between KIA and President Suharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra.</p>
<p>The government has given the joint venture permission to import around 40,000 Timor cars before it starts assembling the vehicles in Indonesia early next year.</p>
<p>PT Timor must meet a local content target of 20 percent in its first year of operation to continue to qualify for the tax breaks and 60 percent by the end of its third year of operation.</p>
<p>The national car policy has also been condemned by the United States and the European Union as breaking WTO rules.</p>
