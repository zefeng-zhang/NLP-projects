<p>A CIA report expressing concern that Russia was losing control over its nuclear arms came as no surprise to interntional military experts who said on Wednesday the real threat was from an accident not an unauthorised attack.</p>
<p>Given economic and military conditions in Russia, they said, it was not unreasonable to conclude that control was weakening.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the report) doesn't entirely surprise me,&quot; Robert Hall, editor of Jane's Intelligence Review, an authoritive monthly on military matters, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russians have been speaking at very high levels with the Americans about their safety procedures to try to reassure them all is well but because of the state of play within Russia itself...it is well within bounds that things aren't going right,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will be an error rather than a deliberate act.&quot;</p>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency report &quot;Prospects for Unsanctioned Use of Russian Nuclear Weapons&quot; which was published in the Washington Times on Tuesday, said the Russian nuclear control system was being sujected to stress which it was not designed to withstand.</p>
<p>The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank, says Russia had 754 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM), 688 submarine-launched  ballistic missiles (SLBM) and 89 bombers on January 1, 1996.</p>
<p>Under START II (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) signed by the U.S. and Russia -- but not yet ratified by the Russian Duma (parliament) -- both countries must reduce their strategic warheads to between 3,000-3,500 by 2003. SLBMs will be limited to 1,750 for each side.</p>
<p>The Washintgon Times cited the CIA report as warning of &quot;conspiracies within nuclear-armed units&quot; to commit blackmail.</p>
<p>Because of low morale and poor living conditions in the Russian military, even within the elite who man nuclear submarines and warheads, the CIA considers it a major threat.</p>
<p>Washington confirmed that the leaked information was correct but was quick to quash concerns that Russia was losing control over its nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But Hall and Rose Gottemoeller, deputy director of the IISS, were not so sure.</p>
<p>&quot;People who operate the nuclear facilities are receiving priority in payment and conditions but overall the conditions in the former Soviet Union are pretty dire and therefore the system is being severely challenged in its ability to maintain the checks and balances it had before,&quot; said Hall.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger of an accident happening through a nuclear reactor or even an old submarine which has not been decommissioned...is perhaps greater than the sensational chance of a terrorist capturing a nuclear weapon from a nuclear storage site.&quot;</p>
<p>Gottemoeller said many of the concerns in the leaked report were not new. Like Hall, she agreed that if something did happen it would most likely not be deliberate.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a chance of something going awry is it more likely to be accident than anything else, particularly with regards to tactical weapons,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a situation we have to worry about.&quot;</p>
