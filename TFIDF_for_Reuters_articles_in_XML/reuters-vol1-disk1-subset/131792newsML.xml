<p>British retail sales are expected to have slowed in September but would not disguise the fact the trend in consumer spending is firmly upwards, economists said.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of economists produced a consensus forecast that sales will fall 0.1 percent in September, leaving them 3.9 percent higher year-on-year.</p>
<p>But given that sales shot up by 1.0 percent in August and anecdotal evidence suggests consumers are spending freely again in October, there is no question of a prolonged slowdown, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is becoming increasingly clear that the long-awaited pick-up in retail fortunes has arrived,&quot; said Philip Uglow, economist at Union Plc.</p>
<p>But as the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey for September showed retail sales grew at a slower pace than in August, as did the British Retail Consortium's sales monitor, there could be a temporary hiatus, he said.</p>
<p>The BRC survey showed retail sales up 5.2 percent year-on-year in September, compared with growth of 6.9 percent in August. &quot;Both imply a small fall in official sales in September,&quot; Uglow said.</p>
<p>David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders, noted that weekly sales figures from stores and supermarkets group John Lewis Partnership, had also waned a little in September.</p>
<p>&quot;We look for a small monthly decline but this will not negate the upward trend,&quot; he said, adding that John Lewis and weekly M0 money supply figures so far in October suggested sales have picked up again.</p>
<p>Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said rocketing clothing and footwear prices in September were likely to have forced sales volumes lower in that sector.</p>
<p>Retail price figures, released earlier this month, showed clothing and footwear prices leapt by 5.2 percent last month, the biggest jump since records began in 1947.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several signs that retail sales slipped back in September,&quot; Saunders said, highlighting evidence from the CBI, BRC and John Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;Even with a modest dip in spending in September, however, the trend in third-quarter retail sales is likely to remain reasonably buoyant.&quot;</p>
<p>He forecast a 0.3 percent fall in September sales, more extreme than the market consensus, but said even that would leave third quarter sales 0.9 percent higher than in the second quarter.</p>
