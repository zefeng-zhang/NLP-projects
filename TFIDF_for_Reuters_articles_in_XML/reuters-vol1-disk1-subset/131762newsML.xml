<p>South African tobacco tycoon Johann Rupert and Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma are squaring up for a fight with the nation's health versus customs corruption worth up to 12 billion rand a year on the agenda.</p>
<p>Zuma warned in the Senate last week she would outlaw all tobacco advertising if companies, including Rupert's Rembrandt Group , continued to bend the law on health warnings.</p>
<p>Rupert fired back with a full-page open letter in a Sunday newspaper saying that smuggling and customs corruption letting tonnes of contraband into the country were the real issues.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ironic and a sad fact of our society that a company which dutifully pays its taxes and goes out of its way to comply with the letter and spirit of the law is now being accused by you of breaking the law. We find (this) totally unacceptable and irresponsible,'' he said.</p>
<p>So far, Zuma and Rupert have argued past each other, with one citing the moral debate over smoking and the other the emotional debate about crime and corruption in South Africa's 30-month-old democracy.</p>
<p>Health Ministry spokesman Vincent Hlongwane said on Monday Zuma had called in the police to investigate companies' compliance with laws requiring prominent health warnings and risk statistics on all cigarette advertisements and packaging.</p>
<p>&quot;The police are investigating how these companies are flouting the law. They are looking at the absence of health warnings, the size of health warnings, everything.</p>
<p>&quot;The minister is quite serious about improving the lives of all the people in this country, especially the young. If a ban on advertising would help to reduce the number of young people who smoke, then why shouldn't she go that route,'' he said.</p>
<p>Rupert's appeal was to the major white concern in post-apartheid South Africa - rampant and escalating crime and corruption.</p>
<p>Rembrandt spokesman Hans Knoetze said that smuggled cigarettes accounted for an estimated one to two percent of the country's cigarette sales.</p>
<p>Retail analyst Syd Vianelio of stockbroker BOE Natwest said the battle was likely to be tough because Rupert, never a friend of big government, controlled between 82 and 86 percent of the domestic cigarette market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he's fed up. The government has handicapped Rembrandt through foreign exchange restrictions on their investments abroad and now they are restricting their efforts to sell cigarettes.</p>
<p>Veteran anti-smoking campaigner Harry Seftel, a doctor who deals with smoking-related illness, dismissed Rupert's case as &quot;balderdash.''</p>
<p>&quot;Rupert may win in the short term, but in the long term we are going to win because the tobacco industry has finally come up against a minister who is really committed to the fight against smoking and is not scared of them,'' he said.</p>
<p>Seftel, chairman of the South African National Council Against Smoking, said Rembrandt's argument that advertising targetted existing smokers would not bear scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody spends that kind of money to bolster a market he's already got. It's about recruiting youngsters to smoke, about finding live smokers to replace the dead smokers,'' he said.</p>
<p>He said the council estimated the national cigarette advertising budget at around 150 million rand a year.</p>
<p>The government has acknowledged the problem of customs corruption and fraud with Finance Minister Trevor Manuel saying repeatedly there can be no viable trade policy until the country can control its borders.</p>
<p>Officials estimate that smuggling and lax border controls cost the country about 12 billion rand a year in lost income. Foreign donors including the French are helping the fight with training for customs officials and gifts of equipment.</p>
