<p>Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Monday he wanted to stay on as prime minister as his party won the largest number of seats in Sunday's general election.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to continue to be in charge of the government as the leader of the party which has the largest number of seats in parliament,&quot; he told a news conference.  </p>
<p>But Hashimoto also said that the polls, in which his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) failed to win a majority in parliament, showed that the electorate did not have full confidence in the party.</p>
<p>The LDP captured 239 seats in the 500-seat Lower House of parliament and Hashimoto was due to meet other members of the outgoing coalition later on Monday to try to form a new working majority.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said he favoured a continued coalition with the Social Democratic Party and the small Sakigake party, even though both parties saw a sharp fall in support. The Social Democrats now have 15 seats against 30 previously, while Sakigake has just two, compared with nine.</p>
<p>But Hashimoto also signalled a readiness to talk with the new Democratic Party, which captured 52 seats in the election.</p>
