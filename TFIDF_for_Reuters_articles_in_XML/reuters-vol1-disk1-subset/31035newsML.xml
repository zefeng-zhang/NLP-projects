<p>Anglo-French space firm Matra Marconi Space Systems (MMS) on Wednesday said the future of the European space industry lay in creating a single satellite group to tackle U.S. competition.</p>
<p>A planned Franco-German merger fell short of the right solution, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The future is one major prime contractor,&quot; Louis Armand Carlier, MMS chief executive officer, told reporters at the Farnborough air show.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone admits the only one way to survive is to achieve the alliance&quot; but the means were undecided, he said.</p>
<p>Scarce government funds for space needed to be pooled at the prime contractor level to cut out duplication and build bigger satellites to meet a booming market, he said.</p>
<p>Carlier said a planned satellite business merger of French state-owned Aerospatiale and Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) would not rationalise capacity as Dasa was not a prime contractor but a supplier to Aerospatiale.</p>
<p>&quot;The marriage (of Dasa and Aerospatiale), assuming it happens, won't mean a rationalisation,&quot; he said, likening it to a takeover by the prime contractor of its subcontractor.</p>
<p>Matra is a unit the Groupe Lagardere conglomerate, while Marconi is a subsidiary of GEC Plc.</p>
<p>MMS, as an Anglo-French venture, had paved the way for cross-border consolidation and Carlier hoped it would &quot;play a decisive role in the future&quot;.</p>
<p>It expected to post sales of $1.6 billion this year, up from $1.3 billion in 1995, and was seeing annual growth rates of 10-12 percent, Carlier said. Its order book is growing, with $2 billion in new orders this year.</p>
<p>Carlier's comments revived memories of Matra's attempts at last year's Paris air show to derail the Aerospatiale-Dasa satellite alliance with a proposal to take over Aerospatiale's satellite centre at Cannes, southern France.</p>
<p>The criticism of the long-delayed creation of the European Satellite Industries (ESI) joint venture between Aerospatiale and Dasa is likely to fuel fears voiced by senior Aerospatiale executives that Matra might exploit delays in a parallel missiles merger with Dasa and woo the German firm to its side.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michot told reporters before the air show that completion of the missiles joint venture with Dasa was taking longer than expected, laying it open to uncertainty.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale executives are frustrated that government approval for the missile and satellite mergers has not been translated into commercial reality.</p>
<p>A Matra spokesman said the company has long believed the future lay in creating a single giant company in tactical missiles and its Matra BAe Dynamics joint venture with British Aerospace Plc was a natural focus for any consolidation.</p>
<p>Matra has had discussions with Dasa in recent months as part of the French company's bid in the Thomson SA privatisation and talks have been continuing on missiles and satellites at the air show, the spokesman said. Dasa is also a shareholder in Lagardere.</p>
