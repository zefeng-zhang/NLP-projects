<p>Cambodia's co-defence ministers, Tea Banh and Tea Chamrath, arrived in Thailand on Wednesday on their way to a planned meeting with top Khmer Rouge dissident Ieng Sary at a secret location.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be meeting him (Ieng Sary) soon but do not know when and where the meeting will be held. I hope that the meeting will be fruitful,&quot; Tea Banh told Reuters on his arrival at Bangkok airport with a senior defence delegation.</p>
<p>Tea Banh and Tea Chamrath were then whisked away by Thai military officials to an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>Tea Banh would be the most senior government official to meet with the Khmer Rouge dissidents since the guerrilla group split last month.</p>
<p>Ieng Sary heads the faction that left the Maoist Khmer Rouge group headed by Pol Pot.</p>
<p>On Monday, co-premier Hun Sen met in western Cambodia with Ieng Sary's representatives and said they had asked to gradually integrate with government troops. They had also sought a royal amnesty for Ieng Sary.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of royal amnesty I think we can easily implement. But on the subject of integration of the territory (controlled by dissident Khmer Rouge), we have to discuss further details,&quot; Tea Banh said.</p>
<p>Ieng Sary was foreign minister during the Khmer Rouge's &quot;killing fields&quot; reign of terror between 1975-79. More than one million people died from disease, starvation or overwork in mass labour camps run by the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>French-educated Ieng Sary, a former brother in law of Pol Pot who now is in his 60s, was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the genocide. He was seen as Pol Pot's number two.</p>
<p>The location of Ieng Sary's hideout is not known, but he is believed by Thai intelligence sources to be near Phnom Malai in northwestern Cambodia. His supporters control at least two major strongholds in the Phnom Malai and Pailin areas.</p>
<p>Clandestine Khmer Rouge radio run by the hardliners has called for the destruction of Ieng Sary and his supporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts said Hun Sen's recent meeting with the dissident Khmer Rouge leaders had narrowed the gap between the two sides.</p>
<p>They said the key sticking points appeared to be integration of the territory controlled by the breakaway faction into government hands, and the question of what to do with Ieng Sary.</p>
<p>Cambodian officials said the momentum for talks with the dissidents would continue with the planned meeting between Ieng Sary and Tea Banh's delegation.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the meeting could pave the way for talks between Ieng Sary and co-premiers Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
