<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl made clear on Wednesday that Germany was determined to see the launch of Europe's planned common currency but would not tolerate any politicial compromises along the way.</p>
<p>Speaking at a private celebration in honour of Bundesbank (Central Bank) President Hans Tietmeyer's 65th birthday, Kohl said, &quot;The Euro must come but there should be no feeble compromises.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl's comments were summarised to news agencies by a Bundesbank spokesman in a telephone conference.</p>
<p>A smoldering debate on the criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty governing European economic and monetary union erupted again at the weekend when Italian officials urged the criteria be renegotiated in light of the sluggish economy.</p>
<p>Several German officials, including Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing, vehemently rejected the idea of any change to entry criteria, but one senior German economist suggested at least a delay in the launch date.</p>
<p>Herbert Hax, chairman of Germany's council of economic advisers -- known as the five wise men -- suggested monetary union should be postponed as long as it takes for at least five countries to meet convergence criteria.</p>
<p>A number of European nations, including Germany, are having difficulties meeting the goals of paring budget deficits to around three percent of gross domestic product and cutting government debt to around 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The currency union is scheduled to begin on January 1, 1999 and the new currency, the Euro, is expected to be introduced between 1999 and 2002.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said he backed integration but warned the basis must be right.</p>
<p>&quot;I wholeheartedly back the integration, but the foundations must be the right ones,&quot; Tietmeyer was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said to secure the durability for the currency union, scheduled to begin with member nations who fulfil the entry criteria, an additional set of rules enforcing fiscal austerity must be adopted.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the stability pact will become a basis for the currency union,&quot; Tietmeyer said, adding such a set of rules, seeking to punish nations who stray in fiscal matters, would enhance the union's credibility among markets and citizens.</p>
<p>Kohl, a political ally and long-time friend of Tietmeyer's, bestowed one of Germany's highest honours for civil service on the Bundesbank president.</p>
<p>Kohl said his government had not always benefited from the fact that the Bundesbank was a fiercely independent institution but he had always valued the bank's unwavering inflation fighting policies as a private citizen.</p>
<p>Before coming to the Bundesbank, Tietmeyer served as state secretary in the Finance Ministry and was an adviser charged with handling German monetary union.</p>
