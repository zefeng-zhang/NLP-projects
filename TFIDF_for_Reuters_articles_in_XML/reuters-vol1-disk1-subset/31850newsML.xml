<p>Mexico's bellwether one-month Cetes rate rose on Tuesday on a weak peso, political unease and fears the U.S. Federal Reserve could boost interest rates if U.S. employment data come in stronger than expected this week, fixed income analysts said.</p>
<p>At the primary cetes auction, Banco de Mexico assigned 28-day paper at 25.47 percent, 109 basis points higher than last week.</p>
<p>Rates rose across the yield curve, as the three-month paper rate increased 130 basis points to 29.37 percent, and the six-month paper was up 133 basis points to 31.74 percent. One-year paper yielded 32.43 percent compared with 30.94 percent last week.</p>
<p>The hikes were in line with expectations, and were higher in the longer terms on expectations of a U.S. rate hike.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by Reuters of 11 Cetes dealers before the auction found expectations of a 120 basis points rise in the one-month paper rate.</p>
<p>As recently as July 30 the one-month paper was yielding 30.22 percent, but then fell sharply during the first part of August before rising slightly at the auction last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The auction was affected mainly by political noise and by changes in the secondary market,&quot; said Luis Cedeno, an analyst with Nationsbank.</p>
<p>Mexican markets have been hit by political unrest tied to attacks by a new guerrilla force in several states last week.</p>
<p>An increase in the yield on the U.S. 30-year bond has also caused fears that rates in emerging markets like Mexico will have to follow.</p>
<p>The U.S. long bond ended the day at 7.06 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;What is affecting us now is the uncertainty over political events and the bond rate in the United States,&quot; said one fixed-income market analyst.</p>
<p>The peso pared early losses but still closed with a hefty decline on Tuesday as high U.S. interest rates and political worries spilled into the currency market.</p>
<p>The spot 48-hour peso closed 3.25 centavos weaker at 7.5730/7.5775 per dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in (Cetes) rates was due to the weakness in the peso and the uncertainty ahead of the U.S. employment data...,&quot; said MMS International in a report.</p>
<p>If the employment data are stronger than expected, that could cause the peso to weaken to the mid-7.60 level on fears the Federal Reserve could tighten, the market forecasters MMS said.</p>
