<p>Blue-chip stocks slumped Monday in the second-slowest session of the year as a jump in long-term interest rates to 7 percent drew Wall Street's attention from a battery of buyout deals.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 28.85 points at 5,693.89. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,331 to 869.</p>
<p>Volume of 281.4 million shares just edged past July 29's 281.3 million, the slowest full session so far this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond market is really the story of the stock market,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;As rates go up, stocks are looking more and more expensive,&quot; he said. &quot;The whole mindset of bonds has changed 180 degrees in the past week. There are fears of higher rates and that the Fed will raise rates sooner or later.&quot;</p>
<p>In the bond market, the closely watched 30-year Treasury bond, which plunged 1-3/32 points on Friday, lost another 18/32, and its yield jumped to 7.00 percent from 6.95 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>The last time the bond yield closed above 7 percent was July 30 at 7.04 percent.</p>
<p>Inflation-sensitive bond yields shot up Friday to three-week highs as July durable goods orders rose 1.6 percent, against expectations of a 0.3 percent rise.</p>
<p>Analysts said bond prices were further weighed down in thin trading by upcoming bond offerings. The Treasury will sell $18.75 billion two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion five-year notes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said that the market-making portfolio managers were away on vacation and most are expected to return after the Labour Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;August tends to be the lightest month of the year and the last week of August tends to be one of the lightest,&quot; said Phil Roth, Dean Witter Reynolds' chief technical analyst.</p>
<p>Metz said the flurry of merger pacts announced &quot;was the only place with any real upside action, and Philip Morris.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares of Philip Morris and other tobacco makers recouped some of their stiff losses after an Indiana jury ruled late Friday in favour of major tobacco companies in a tobacco liability case. Philip Morris jumped 2-1/4 to 90-1/4.</p>
<p>Among the acquisitions, Conseco rose two to 44 on news that it will acquire two insurers and increase its stake in two others, giving it full ownership of those firms.</p>
<p>Conseco agreed to buy American Travellers, which gained 3-3/16 to 31-9/16, for $793 million and Capitol American Financial, which rose 9-7/8 to 34-7/8 on Conseco's $650 million buyout.</p>
<p>Silver King Communications was off 1-1/2 at 28 after it agreed to buy Home Shopping Network, whose stock rose 1/8 to 11-3/8. The proposed merger would reunify the two companies, which split in 1992 and supercedes a previous pact to purchase only Liberty Media's controlling interest in Home Shopping.</p>
<p>AccuStaff Inc. and Career Horizons agreed to merge in a stock deal valued at some $1 billion. Career Horizons jumped 5-1/8 to 37, while AccuStaff lost three to 25.</p>
<p>Chancellor Broadcasting agreed to buy 12 radio stations from Colfax Communications for $365 million in cash and working capital. Chancellor rose 1/4 to 37-1/2.</p>
<p>Columbus McKinnon reached an agreement to acquire Spreckels Industries for $24 a share. Spreckels climbed 4-1/8 to 23-1/2 and Columbus was off 3/4 to 14.</p>
<p>Advanced Medical rose 7/16 to 2-7/8 on news that it will buy IVAC Medical Systems in a cash deal worth $400 million.</p>
<p>Olympic Financial soared 6-1/4 to 23-7/8 after it said that a potential buyer was interested in bidding for the company. It also reported that its chairman and chief executive had resigned.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.83 points to 1,139.22.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks lost 3.15 to 663.88. The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.32 to 560.62.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 1.34 to 355.89. The average share was down 14 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,505.484 down 23.692 or 0.36 percent.</p>
