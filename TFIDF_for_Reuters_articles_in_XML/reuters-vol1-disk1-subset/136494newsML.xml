<p>Russia's interior ministry has handed prosecutors documents backing up accusations that ousted security chief Alexander Lebed had been involved in subversive acivity, Itar-Tass news agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A ministry source said the papers &quot;confirmed every word&quot; of accusations made by Interior Ministry Anatoly Kulikov at a news conference a week ago.</p>
<p>The ministry's press office told the agency the papers dealt in part with alleged plans by Lebed to set up a parallel power structure and a parallel general staff.</p>
<p>Kulikov, a bitter foe of Lebed, had accused the security boss of plotting to use force to seize power and said 1,500 gunmen from breakaway Chechnya were ready to help him.</p>
<p>Lebed, sacked the following day by President Boris Yeltsin, denied the accusations.</p>
<p>The reserve paratroop general dismissed the charges anew in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are the crowds or the lists of plotters caught by our esteemed interior minister?&quot; he asked Argumenty i Fakti weekly newspaper with his trademark irony. &quot;Where are their bases? where do they store theuir arms? Where are these Chechens compning to the capital in droves? It is the purest fiction.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed, who spent four months as President Boris Yeltsin's security adviser, sounded disillusioned about power structures in the Kremlin power.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a law like this in the Kremlin. If one agrees with somebody, then we are in the same team. but if one objects, even if the arguments are good, then you fall from the team.&quot;</p>
