<p>President Jacques Chirac has won domestic plaudits and boosted France's standing in the Arab world by distancing Paris from U.S. missile strikes on Iraq, but he is being careful to avoid a serious clash with Washington.</p>
<p>While Britain, Germany and NATO rushed to applaud President Bill Clinton's cruise missile raids to punish Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for sending his troops into Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, France voiced concern and legal misgivings.</p>
<p>The sullen dissent from Paris stopped short of outright condemnation of the U.S. attack, but it was nevertheless the most serious crack to date in the Western coalition that drove Iraqi invasion forces out of Kuwait in 1991.</p>
<p>France reiterated its concern at the situation on Wednesday and called for rapid implementation of a U.N.-brokered plan to allow Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil in exchange for food, which Washington has said must be delayed.</p>
<p>The Franco-American divergences set the scene for a possibly stormy Paris visit on Thursday by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>
<p>&quot;France is following two contradictory imperatives: not to create a crisis with the United States while also asserting its difference. That is the clear line of France's new Arab policy,&quot; said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations (IFRI).</p>
<p>Following closely on differences over Lebanon and Iran, the French dissent on Iraq highlights Chirac's bid to stake out an independent Middle East policy that positions Paris as an altenative broker to Washington, analysts say.</p>
<p>In October the French president is planning his third Middle East visit in six months, hoping to help revive negotiations between Israel and Syria, suspended since before hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was elected in May.</p>
<p>&quot;France can play a role in the region since the United States' even-handedness is somewhat cast in doubt. It is important for Paris to suggest an alternative,&quot; Moisi said.</p>
<p>Most Arab states condemned the U.S. strikes on southern Iraq and even Saudi Arabia, Washington's chief strategic ally in the Arab world, withheld support. Arab diplomats voiced satisfaction with France's position.</p>
<p>However the analysts said Washington would remain the central power in the region because of its military reach and its unique influence on Israel.</p>
<p>And political commentators said Chirac would not go too far in distancing himself from Clinton, hot favourite to win re-election in November.</p>
<p>&quot;Anti-Americanism is an indispensible prop in the Gaullist accessory box, but it it must be handled delicately,&quot; the left-of-centre daily Liberation wrote in an editorial.</p>
<p>Aside from strategic rivalry in a region that has been virtually an exclusive American preserve since the end of the Cold War, French officials say Paris has genuine policy differences with Washington over the right approach to Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;Keeping Iraq in poverty and attacking it from time to time has not succeeded in toppling Saddam nor in stabilising the region, but only reinforced him in power while his population starves,&quot; one policymaker said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans may think they're punishing Saddam, but they're actually helping him,&quot; another official said.</p>
<p>France's legal objections have focused on Iraq's territorial integrity and thus its right to use its own forces on its own soil, especially since one of the two main Kurdish factions requested Baghdad's intervention, accusing neighbouring Iran of arming and abetting a rival Kurdish guerrilla movement.</p>
<p>The French believe the U.S. policy of &quot;dual containment&quot; against Iraq and Iran, Washington's two favourite Middle East bogeymen, is misguided. They advocate instead a &quot;critical dialogue&quot; aimed at giving both Gulf states incentives for better international behaviour.</p>
<p>France was Saddam's biggest Western arms supplier until Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Baghdad owes Paris some $4 billion and French oil companies are impatient to do business in Iraq once U.N. sanctions are eased.</p>
