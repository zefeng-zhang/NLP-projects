<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ dlr surges to higher close on offshore buying.</title>
<headline>NZ dlr surges to higher close on offshore buying.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>The New Zealand dollar surged higher on Monday, posting fresh eight-year highs in the process and closing around 71 U.S. cents.</p>
<p>&quot;The offshore buying is just getting stronger and stronger and it's just going to push the currency higher and higher,&quot; a chief dealer said.</p>
<p>The Kiwi closed at 0430 GMT at US$0.7096/03 and at 67.71 on its Trade-Weighted Index, up from 0.7048/55 and 67.30 at the opening.  </p>
<p>&quot;We heard there was some buying of Kiwi against the yen out of Japan today and really, a bit like the old 07/98 bond, there's just a lack of supply at the moment,&quot; the chief dealer said.</p>
<p>At 79.92/07, the Kiwi was at a five-year high against the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hearing there's going to be more interest out of Japan to buy Kiwi over the coming week, so personally, I think we might get into the mid-0.7100s pretty easily this week,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>He said New Zealand's high real interest rates continued to attract offshore investors.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, as long as the Reserve Bank continues to hold interest rates at these levels, the Kiwi will just keep going higher and higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The Reserve Bank knows this, they just deliberately want the currency higher and higher to flatten out inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kiwi was seen trading a 0.7070-7120 range overnight.</p>
