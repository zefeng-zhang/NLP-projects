<p>The Polish government's food market regulator, the Agriculture Market Agency (ARR), is likely to import grain at the end of the second quarter of 1997, but sees near-term grain prices flat, its president said.</p>
<p>Kazimierz Gutowski told Reuters in an interview the imports would be needed if demand on the domestic market again made the ARR intervene in the first quarter of the year, as it had done in the past two years.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a need for the ARR to mobilise (grain) sales in January or February, then we can rebuild (reserves) in May or June through imports,&quot; Gutowski said.</p>
<p>He said the ARR quietly imported some 520,000 tonnes of grain to build up reserves in September because Polish farmers held back with sales of grain from this year's harvest expecting prices to rise later in the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We planned to rebuild reserves using domestic grains, but even after we increased prices two times, we bought only 80,000 tonnes, which is much to small to rebuild reserves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, we purchased 520,000 tonnes of grain abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>The agency, whose budget will likely be in the region of 400 million zlotys in 1997, wants to build up the country's grain reserves to 2.2 million tonnes in the 1996/97 growing season (July/June) from 1.4 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>The ARR estimates Poland's grain import needs between one and 1.3 million tonnes in the 96/97 season, after it bought 1.8 million abroad in 95/96.</p>
<p>He said grain price growth, at nearly 70 percent in year-on-year terms in September, would slow from its rampant pace in the tail end of 1996 and early next year as Polish prices were already at world levels.</p>
<p>&quot;During 1994 and 1995 farmers got accustomed to steep grain price increases, much higher than overall inflation. They think that if the ARR buys wheat at 600 zlotys/tonne, they can sell it later at 900 zlotys, but they are mistaken,&quot; Gutowski said.</p>
<p>He said grain prices will be flat in the coming months because of competitive grain imports, aided by a zero duty import tariff on grains until the end the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Zero-duty grain imports until the end of the year will cause wheat prices to be very stable,&quot; Gutowski said.</p>
<p>Late on Monday a committee of the Polish government said it wanted to extend the zero-duty grain import period to June 30, 1997, but the measure still has to be accepted by the full cabinet in order to come into force.</p>
