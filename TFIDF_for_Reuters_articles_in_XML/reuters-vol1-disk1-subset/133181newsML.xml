<p>Foreign investors should step swiftly but wisely into Russia's emerging market, where the economy is poised for growth but buyers have to know what they are doing, equity strategists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;For investors, this is the time to get involved more deeply in the market,&quot; Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch in London, told an international investments conference.</p>
<p>On Monday, a $373.3 million international share issue by Russian energy giant RAO Gazprom saw applications for five times that amount.</p>
<p>Lubash said the Russian economy would see a burst in foreign direct investment in 1997 on the back of fundamental factors which he said were stronger than official statistics suggest.</p>
<p>September industrial production was officially 6.8 percent lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p>But Lubash said the numbers took little note of growth in Russia's shadow economy, which he said accounted for about one third of the total economy.</p>
<p>Foreign investors have so far fought shy of Russia, fearing political instability and economic risk. High taxes, a poor infrastructure and inadequate legislation on investments and bankruptcy have also kept many away.</p>
<p>But Lubash said a spate of good news -- including high speculative credit ratings and nearly-complete rescheduling agreements for Russia's $120 billion in foreign debt -- could send institutional investors stampeding into Russia next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign direct investment will accelerate dramatically in 1997,&quot; he said, adding that next year would be the first year of significant foreign direct investment and stabilisation, if not outright growth, in the economy.</p>
<p>Other analysts said the key to good returns on equity and happy strategic investments was in choosing companies, not sectors, and in exerting strong control.</p>
<p>Alexei Nenarokov, vice-president in charge of investment banking at Moscow's big commercial bank Menatep, said now was the time to buy -- but he advised careful choice and the monitoring of investments like a control freak.</p>
<p>&quot;If you hit it right in direct investment, you hit it big,&quot; he said. &quot;(But) if you buy a company just because you think the sector is attractive, you may be in for nasty surprises.&quot;</p>
<p>He said controlling stakes in prize and second-tier companies would become less available next year as domestic banks and company management sought to consolidate their holdings.</p>
<p>Market analysts said the political picture was not as bad as some headlines suggested, since Kremlin power struggles were coming to a climax and reforms were firmly entrenched.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund had bolstered reforms with a $10 billion three-year loan and credit agency Standard &amp; Poor's BB minus credit rating for long-term Russian foreign currency debt had made Moscow look more attractive on debt markets.</p>
<p>Privatisation revenues are far below targets. But top firms, including oil, telecommunications and utilities, will find it easier to borrow abroad now that Russia has a credit rating.</p>
<p>But wage arrears -- a bugbear of the economy -- rose 10 percent in September alone, hitting a total of more than 40 trillion roubles ($9 billion), and tax revenues are far behind schedule.</p>
<p>Lubash said the problem was more disciplinary than fiscal and the money to fuel economic growth existed. &quot;1996 has been a very good year -- we've seen a superb performance of over 100 percent returns,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Alexander Livshits told Itar-Tass news agency that Russia's federal budget aimed to keep spending under control to attract foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;There is always something to wait for in Russia,&quot; Nenarokov said, adding that now was the time to buy and that deal-making activity with major shareholders would heat up significantly.</p>
