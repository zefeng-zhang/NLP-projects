<p>Shares in loss-making Italian information technology group Olivetti seesawed on Wednesday after the sudden resignation of chairman Carlo De Benedetti and as the group turned in another half year loss.</p>
<p>The share price jumped nearly 13 percent in early trade as the market reacted positively to what was seen as De Benedetti's defeat in a fierce duel for control with new managing director Francesco Caio.</p>
<p>But the stock rapidly subsided to only two percent higher as initial enthusiasm waned and caution set in.</p>
<p>&quot;De Benedetti's resignation is positive but once people understand the complete value of Olivetti then the price fluctuation is more likely to be minus 10 than plus 10 percent,&quot; said broker Robert Meier of Pasfin Securities in Milan.</p>
<p>Olivetti was due to hold a phone-in conference with analysts at 1600 GMT and dealers wanted to see what financial details and explanations emerged, particularly what it proposes to do with its loss-making personal computer company.</p>
<p>Olivetti said late on Tuesday it made a 440.2 billion lire ($290.6 million) pre-tax loss for the first half of 1996, compared with a full year consolidated loss of 1.598 trillion in 1995.</p>
<p>It also made a 200 billion lire provision for restructuring and divestments deriving from its decision to &quot;accelerate the reduction of its presence in the hardware sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders and analysts took this to mean it wants to exit from the competitive PC sector, the area that made De Benedetti's name in the 1980s but proved a drag on the group in the tougher climate of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Olivetti shares had a jerky opening after the 61-year-old tycoon resigned late on Tuesday, soaring 10 percent from near record lows previously and triggering automatic suspension.</p>
<p>Stock market authorities widened fluctuation bands to 15 percent and the share climbed to 820 lire (54 cents) per share before slipping back to stand at 740 lire by 1145 GMT.</p>
<p>The stock lost around nine percent on Monday and Tuesday, coming close to a record low of 681 lire hit last July as rumours abounded about conflict between De Benedetti and Caio, a 39-year-old who took over as managing director in July.</p>
<p>&quot;Carlo De Benedetti has lost the duel for Olivetti,&quot; the Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera wrote. It called the demise of &quot;The Engineer&quot; after nearly 20 years with the company &quot;the start of a new phase in the history of Olivetti&quot;.</p>
<p>La Repubblica newspaper said that after three days of furious clashes between De Benedetti and Caio, they had reached a compromise announced late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>De Benedetti remains honorary chairman but quits the board and is replaced by board member Antonio Tesone, a longstanding lawyer for the financier's affairs. His son Rodolfo will also form part of an executive committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The news is bullish,&quot; said a broker here. &quot;But the bottom line is the company is still losing money and people need to see a complete restructuring.&quot;</p>
<p>Union leaders at Olivetti's personal computer factory in Scarmagno called a one-hour stoppage on Wednesday, citing their concern for the future of their jobs.</p>
<p>Brokers said the prospect of strikes added to the woes of the PC company, which made a loss in the first half of this year and has been losing money for the past few years.</p>
<p>&quot;They've said they want to get out of PCs but who's going to buy it from them?&quot; another said.</p>
