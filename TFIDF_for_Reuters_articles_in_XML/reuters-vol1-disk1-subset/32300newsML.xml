<p>Defence Secretary William Perry said on Wednesday that allied planes faced off two Iraqi MIGs without incident and fired at an anti-aircraft radar on the first day of patrolling an expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;We encountered two challenges on this first day of patrolling again,&quot; Perry told reporters. &quot;In one of them, two MIGs approached our planes from the north but both of them turned back before they got to 33 degrees north&quot; at the border of the expanded no-fly zone, he said.  </p>
<p>In the second incident, which had been reported minutes earlier by other Pentagon officials, a U.S. F-16 jet fired a Harm missile at an anti-aircraft radar that had begun tracking the plane. Perry and other officials said the radar went silent although they could not say whether it was destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>All the action occurred in or around the new expanded no-fly zone which the allies began patrolling over southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War and which they extended on Wednesday by one degree of latitude up to Baghdad's southern suburbs.</p>
<p>The extension was part of U.S. retaliation for President Saddam Hussein's decision to send troops into a Kurdish area of northern Iraq also protected by the allies. That sparked two rounds of U.S. cruise missile attacks against Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses in the south on Tuesday, an effort that Perry said had now been successfully completed.</p>
<p>&quot;We have successfuly completed the mission to attack the air defense facilities -- a total of 14 air defense facilities -- south of the 33rd paraellel,&quot; he said at a joint news briefing with visiting British Defense Minister Michael Portillo.</p>
