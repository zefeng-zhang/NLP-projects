<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Monday, bearing gifts in the form of $529 million for environmental projects, officials said.</p>
<p>On a 10-day Latin American tour intended to show Japanese firms the region was again ripe for investment after the &quot;Lost Decade&quot; of the 1980s debt crises and hyperinflation, Hashimoto focused on bilateral issues in talks with Cardoso.</p>
<p>The two leaders also found time to discuss reform of the United Nations and global environmental issues and agreed to push for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at the next U.N. session, the Japanese premier's spokesman told reporters.</p>
<p>But trade topped the agenda. Hashimoto expressed Tokyo's desire for Brazil to ensure its car import rules, which favour manufacturers with Brazilian factories, conformed with World Trade Organisation rules.</p>
<p>Brazil's recent decision to set quotas for low-tariff car imports was a &quot;first step towards improving market access,&quot; but Japan would press on with WTO consultations over the rules themselves, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;If a member of the WTO takes measures against its rules, then the WTO itself is challenged. Brazil is a responsible member of the WTO and has got to abide by its rules,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After 1-1/2 hours of talks, Cardoso and Hashimoto presided over the signing of $529 million in Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) financing for four environmental projects in Brazil. They included programmes in the states of Parana and Santa Catarina, a project to clean the Bay of All Saints in Salvador in Brazil's northeast and a wind-powered energy project in the northern state of Ceara.</p>
<p>After lunch in Brasilia's futuristic Foreign Ministry building, Hashimoto met representatives of Brazil's 1.3 million-strong Japanese community, the largest outside Japan.</p>
<p>For Brazilian officials, the first visit by a Japanese prime minister in almost 15 years reflected renewed confidence in Latin America's largest economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is politically eloquent that (you) have come to Brazil less than six months after my visit to Japan,&quot; Cardoso said at the luncheon. &quot;Watching closely our relations, your excellency knows that Brazil has changed, and for the better.&quot;</p>
<p>Hashimoto also broached ties between Tokyo and the four-nation Mercosur customs union, of which Brazil is the powerhouse, and voiced his concern at &quot;economic regionalism.&quot; He proposed holding a high-level meeting in October to discuss ties, expressing Tokyo's desire that the bloc should not cut itself off from the outside world.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's tour has already taken him to Mexico and Chile. He was due next in Peru where he will meet President Alberto Fujimori, himself the son of Japanese immigrants, on Tuesday. Fujimori rose from obscurity to defeat world renowned novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in 1990 presidential elections.</p>
<p>Hashimoto will also visit members of the 100,000-strong Japanese community founded in Peru in 1899 by immigrants who came to work on sugar plantations.</p>
<p>He was expected to announce in Peru an economic aid and cooperation package worth several hundred million dollars. Japan has been a key ally since Fujimori's election, pumping an estimated $900 million into a country where at least half of the 24 million inhabitants live in poverty.</p>
