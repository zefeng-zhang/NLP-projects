<p>Nichiei Finance Co Ltd plans to call on its major creditor banks to forgive loans to the finance company, a company executive told a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He also said that the Yokohama district court received Nichiei Finance's filing for liquidation, which the company had submitted earlier today.  </p>
<p>The executive said Nichiei Finance, a unit of lumber firm Nichiei Co Ltd, had borrowed 170.89 billion yen from financial institutions as of the end of September and hoped to pay back as much of that amount as possible.</p>
<p>He said the company had not borrowed any money from non-bank financial institutions.</p>
<p>He also said Nichiei Finance's customer base was mostly individuals borrowing money for housing.</p>
<p>Of the 820.65 billion yen debts which Nichiei Finance had guaranteed, about 100 billion yen was estimated to be non-performing, he said.</p>
<p>He did not say how many creditors Nichiei Finance had, but said the main creditor banks account for about 50 percent of the money the company had borrowed.</p>
<p>The executive said that while Nichiei Finance had tried hard to restructure itself with help from main creditor banks and its parent company Nichiei Co Ltd since September 1994, the value of its assets had deteriorated rapidly because of the protracted slump in Japan's real estate market.</p>
