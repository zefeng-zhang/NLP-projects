<headline>Euromarkets ignore Iraq raid, Wall St fall.</headline>

<p>European financial markets took news of a second U.S. strike on Iraq in their stride on Wednesday, with stocks trading stronger, gold weaker, and the dollar rock steady.</p>
<p>The bourses shrugged off Wall Street's weak opening to trade steady at the higher levels established earlier on Wednesday.</p>
<p>British shares, which had been buoyed by New York's reversal from slump to 30-point gain on Tuesday, took the Dow's opening falls calmy, and traded around 20 points ahead, not far from their best 23-point gain.</p>
<p>An agreed 264 million pound ($412.1 million) bid by food distributor Booker for food wholesaler Nurdin &amp; Peacock also helped sentiment, sending the blue chip FTSE 100 index up 25 points.</p>
<p>Traders said the London market was likely to be quiet because of a monetary meeting between Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George and finance minister Kenneth Clarke.</p>
<p>German shares ended their bourse session up 21 points, but the electronically traded IBIS DAX was down around two points.</p>
<p>Dealers said that trade was likely to be steady, but the focus was definitely on key U.S. non-farm payroll data for August due on Friday, which could set the tone for U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>In Paris, French stocks traded around 15 points higher, helped by firmer bond prices ignoring Wall Street's opening dips.</p>
<p>Oil stocks Total and Elf-Aquitaine, which have risen on the back of higher oil prices, extended their gains after Total confirmed investor expectations of good results by reporting a 45 percent jump in its first-half profit.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar was off its highs against the mark and off its earlier lows against the yen in lacklustre trade in the European afternoon.</p>
<p>Dealers said market attention had shifted from the U.S. attacks in Iraq to Thursday's German GDP data and, more importantly, Friday's U.S. jobs figures against a backdrop of growing expectations of higher U.S. rates near-term.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a waiting game now until Friday, no one's willing to stick their neck out ahead of the payrolls,&quot; said a dealer at a U.S. bank here. &quot;The Iraq story is still there but it's been moved very much to the background now.&quot;</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.4840 marks and 108.75 yen after 1.4837 marks and 109.25 yen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 17.1 points at 3,873.0.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was 21.16 up at 2,532.37. The IBIS DAX was down 2.96 at 2,525.77.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 10.68 at 1,982.33.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed easier at $385.60 vs $385.95 this morning and $386.60 Tuesday afternoon.</p>
