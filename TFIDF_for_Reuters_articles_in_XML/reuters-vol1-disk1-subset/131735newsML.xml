<p>The European Commission plans to launch a public relations campaign next month aimed at raising awareness of what the European Union's single market can do for ordinary people.</p>
<p>But EU single market commissioner Mario Monti said it would years before people could travel though all the bloc's 15 member states without showing a passport, a right they expected to have almost four years ago.</p>
<p>After the single market turned the EU into a border-free zone on January 1, 1993, goods, services, capital and people should have been able to move freely.</p>
<p>Monti told Reuters in an interview he gave the market eight out of 10 for its impact on ordinary people, as opposed to business, but admitted the EU's executive Commission should get only six out of 10 for its efforts to explain how people could make use of it.</p>
<p>A major benefit had been the freedom to move from one country to another to work or study, but many people stayed at home because they did not understand conditions elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes to correct the information imbalance in its &quot;Citizens First&quot; campaign to be launched during a meeting of EU internal trade ministers in Brussels on November 26, Monti said.</p>
<p>Through television commercials and information packs, the Commission will try to better inform people about their rights to work and study across the EU.</p>
<p>But Monti acknowledged people would only accept the single market was a success when they could leave their passports in their pockets while crossing from one member country to another.</p>
<p>&quot;The man and the woman in the street will never accept that the single market is really in place for European citizens as long as they see the persistence of internal border controls.&quot;</p>
<p>Monti said that the Schengen zone -- which allows free travel between France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- had proved borders could be dropped without weakening security.</p>
<p>But efforts to persuade all countries to do away with border controls have met objections that will be hard to overcome until ways are found to prevent criminals, terrorists and illegal immigrants abusing the freedom of easy travel.</p>
<p>EC internal trade ministers will this week discuss proposals for three laws allowing EU citizens and third country nationals legally resident in the EU to move around unchecked, once adequate security arrangements are in place.</p>
<p>But, anticipating comments by members of the European Parliament who discuss the plans in Strasbourg this week, Monti said passport-free travel could not be allowed until people could move around safely.</p>
<p>He said he received as many letters from EU citizens urging increased security as he did demanding passport-free travel.</p>
