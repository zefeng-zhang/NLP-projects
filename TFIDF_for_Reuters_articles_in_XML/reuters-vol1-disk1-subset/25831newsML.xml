<p>Franco-German helicopter maker Eurocopter is engaged in sensitive talks with the French government aimed at ensuring its passage through an order famine which could entail job losses, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Jean-Francois Bigay, chairman of Eurocopter told reporters ahead of the biennial Farnborough airshow, that the world helicopter market would remain difficult in the medium term because of tough competition and stagnant sales.</p>
<p>The company, a joint venture between French state-owned SNI Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany, has sufficient orders for 1997 and 1998 but then faces a lean period until it delivers the first Tiger combat helicopter to the French army in 2002.</p>
<p>France's centre-right French government has slashed spending in the defence budget for 1997-2002 and has earmarked funds for only four super Puma transport helicopters.</p>
<p>The defence cuts have raised labour union concern that 1,000 Eurcopter jobs could go in France on top of the 800 French posts and 350 German posts to be axed in a current restructuring plan which runs until 1997.</p>
<p>The French government is highly sensitive to any job losses as the latest figures show the unemployment rate at a record 12.5 percent and unions are opposing a budget freeze for 1997 which will lead to up to 7000 layoffs in the civil service.</p>
<p>France is scheduled to have a general election in 1998.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michot said Eurocopter was in talks with the government to see whether more measures will be needed after 1997.</p>
<p>He said the government had asked him in the first half of this year whether more had to be done because orders were not being placed.</p>
<p>Since then, however, Eurocopter received about five billion French francs ($988 million) in new orders, selling aircraft to Abu Dhabi, Saud Arabia and Spain. &quot;The orders are now coming in. It is clear we have to implement the whole of the restructuring plan as it was conceived.</p>
<p>&quot;Beyond that we will have to discuss to see what the situation is and whether or not to take further measures,&quot; Michot said.</p>
<p>Bigay, however, said it looked like no fresh job cuts would be needed on top of those in the current restructuring plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We think for the moment our order book for 1997 and 1998 gives us a clear view that there will be no significant change in the very short term, which is not to say there won't be a problem until 2002,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bigay said the government expects to make a small loss in 1996 and break even in 1997 as a result of the restructuring plan. He gave no figures for profits.</p>
<p>He forecast Eurocopter's turnover for 1996 would be 9.8 billion francs and 9.56 billion francs in 1997, compared to 9.32 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>The company expects the payroll to shrink to 8,900 in 1997 from an estimated 9,500 this year and 9,800 in 1995. ($1=5.063 French Franc)</p>
