<p>Oil markets reacted calmly on Wednesday to news of a second U.S. missile strike on Iraq but analysts say nervous traders are reluctant to take profits amid continuing tension in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In early trading on London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), October Brent Blend crude oil futures were down 35 cents on the day at $21.86 a barrel.</p>
<p>Analysts said any real or perceived threat to vital oil supplies in the region, combined with already strong demand at a time when inventories are low, should keep oil prices firm through the end of the year.</p>
<p>The market will be prone to knee-jerk reactions resulting in price spikes as long as the standoff between Baghdad and Washington continues, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a perceived supply disruption which is causing commercial oil operators to rethink their autumn stock situation. Volatility has returned to the oil market,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, head of the London energy desk at Smith, Barney.</p>
<p>London traders shrugged off the second attack early on Wednesday of U.S. missiles aimed at clearing a path for warplanes to enforce an expanded &quot;no-fly&quot; zone in Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;The spike up on hitting the military sites is a bit overdone. We made it for six years without any Iraqi oil,&quot; one London futures broker said.</p>
<p>Despite the pullback, Brent has gained more than $1 this week and is nearly $6 above levels seen this time last year.</p>
<p>Baghdad's attacks on Kurdish strongholds have prompted an indefinite delay in implementing a United Nations agreement allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil to pay for food and medical suppliers.</p>
<p>Without the expected 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iraq oil, analysts wonder if there will be enough oil around to meet peak winter demand in industrialised countries.</p>
<p>Iraq has been banned from exporting oil since it invaded neighbour Kuwait in August 1990 but traders had expected its return sometime this month before the deal was put on hold on Sunday by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p>
<p>Low stocks of heating fuel going into the peak winter demand period and general uncertainty in the Middle East have resulted in a radical switch from bearish to bullish sentiment, analysts say.</p>
<p>Energy consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) has revised up by $1 to $19.25 its forecast for average Brent prices in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We have moved the price forecast up because we just do not expect Iraqi oil back on the market this year and the market could use that oil to fill growing demand,&quot; said Peter Bogin, an associate director at CERA.</p>
<p>Although the cat-and-mouse game between the United States and Iraq should keep a floor under prices for some time, other supply-demand fundamentals have sparked the analysts' change of heart.</p>
<p>Bogin said the low level of stocks of middle distillates like heating oil in both the United States and Europe and the prospect of a return of last winter's deep freeze are more influential on the oil price now than Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at a 40 percent increase in the price of gas oil (heating oil) in Europe heading into the fourth quarter, compared to last year. If the stock situation is not corrected soon, consumers are going to pay considerably more to heat their homes,&quot; Bogin said.</p>
