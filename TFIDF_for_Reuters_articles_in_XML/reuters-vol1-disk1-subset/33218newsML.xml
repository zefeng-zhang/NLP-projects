<p>Russia's foreign minister said on Wednesday that Moscow would soon hand back Liechtenstein's royal family archive in exchange for a rare document detailing the last moments of murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family.</p>
<p>The swap of historic treasures will help cement increasingly warm ties between Russia and the tiny Alpine principality of 30,000 people nestled between Switzerland and Austria, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We in the foreign ministry will do our utmost to ensure that this (exchange) is not delayed,&quot; Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov told reporters in the Liechtenstein capital after signing a bilateral accord on cultural, archival and youth exchanges.</p>
<p>Primakov and Prince Hans-Adam II, Liechtenstein's ruler, exchanged letters on Tuesday night agreeing the swap, which will cap years of effort by the principality's royal family to get back its prized archives from Moscow.</p>
<p>Red Army troops seized the records from Liechtenstein Castle southwest of Vienna when they marched into Austria in 1945. They loaded the documents into trucks bound for Moscow, where they have remained for years despite Liechtenstein's entreaties.</p>
<p>Hans-Adam gained leverage in the dispute when he bought at a London auction the Sokolov Archive, documenting the firing-squad executions of the last Russian tsar and his family by Bolsheviks in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on July 17, 1918.</p>
<p>The archive is named after a high-ranking officer who rescued the documents from the Bolsheviks and brought them out to France, according to local press reports.</p>
<p>Details of the handover must still be worked out by experts in both countries, officials said, but they made clear they expected this chapter of history soon to draw to a close.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign minister and the prince exchanged letters yesterday that envision the return of the royal family's archives and, as a sign of our gratitude, the presentation of the Sokolov Archive to Russia,&quot; said Liechtenstein's foreign minister, Andrea Willi.</p>
<p>The transfer is the crowning achievement in diplomatic relations that began only in 1994.</p>
