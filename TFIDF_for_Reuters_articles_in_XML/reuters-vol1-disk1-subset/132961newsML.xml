<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The stock market failed to emulate Monday's record-breaking run as profit-taking, weaker futures prices and a cautious opening on Wall Street put the brakes on investor enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 share index, which on Monday touched a record 4,073.2 points, ended at 4,057.2, down 15.9 on the day.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT- German shares closed bourse trade lower, weighed down by a weaker dollar and losses on Wall Street overnight and in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade down 10.05 points at 2,718.98. In post-bourse trade the index fell 11.93 to 2,721.74.</p>
<p>PARIS - French stocks ended a touch weaker on continued but limited consolidation after a see-saw day for magazines-to- missiles group Lagardere after positive reaction to its planned takeover of Thomson.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 4.61 points or 0.21 percent at 2,175.61.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended lower in slow trading marked by a general lack of investor interest.</p>
<p>The all-share SPI closed 7.04 points lower at 2,422.61.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended weak after wandering into negative territory throughout the session. Brokers said the market was unable to recover from poor sentiment brought about by elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 closed at 21,123.68, down 179.27 points.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks closed lower after a late afternoon slide trade which brokers described as a short bout of overdue profit-taking.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index shed 65.39 points to 12,444.66 after trending sideways on robust volume during the morning session.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares were pushed to a lower close by modest selling pressure as investors cast a wary eye over Wall Street and awaited local third-quarter inflation data due on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index lost 9.6 points to close at 2,353.6.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold shares ended a quiet day well up on a healthy bullion price and dealers expected further gains.</p>
<p>The overall index was up 16.3 points to 7,027.8, industrials gained 7.3 points to 8,270.2 and golds were up 32.3 points to 1,708.9.</p>
