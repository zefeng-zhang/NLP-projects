<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat won his fight for a summit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday but faces a tougher battle for the independent state that is his dream.</p>
<p>Describing Netanyahu's policies as &quot;idiotic&quot;, Arafat last week accused Israel of declaring war on Palestinians by expanding Jewish settlements and called for a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people,&quot; Arafat told the Palestinian legislature.</p>
<p>For three decades, Arafat has dreamed of leading his people to independence.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing that keeps me going, the most precious thing that is always on my mind, is the regaining of dignity for the Palestinian people, and restoring the name of Palestine to the map of the Middle East,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Those aspirations were dealt a blow when Israel, rocked by Moslem suicide bombings, chose Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, over Labour prime minister Shimon Peres in May elections.</p>
<p>Instead of pursuing negotiations on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Netanyahu began by revoking a settlement freeze imposed by the previous administration and moved to tighten his grip on Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Arafat toured the world appealing for pressure against the new Israeli leader but without any tangible success.</p>
<p>In September 1993, Arafat had taken perhaps his biggest gamble when he sealed an interim peace accord with his old nemesis, then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, with a handshake in Washington.</p>
<p>The accord gave Palestinians limited self-rule in part of the territories captured by the Jewish state in the 1967 Middle East war and left the door open for an independent Palestinian state to emerge within five years.</p>
<p>Arafat shared a Nobel peace prize with Rabin and then Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>Returning in 1994 to the Gaza Strip -- part of the embryo homeland under his accord with Israel -- the one-time symbol of Palestinian unity found himself facing Moslem militants attacking his Israeli peace partner.</p>
<p>In January 1996, Arafat became the first democractically-chosen Palestinian leader when he easily won a general election against a little-known woman activist.</p>
<p>Arafat had kept the PLO alive through unequal battles against Israeli forces and Arab governments anxious to control him. He survived plots and assassination attempts -- and even an air crash --  since becoming PLO chairman in 1969.</p>
<p>Short and bald, Arafat hardly cuts a heroic figure. But to Palestinians, even those lukewarm about his policies, he is known avuncularly as Abu Ammar, his nom de guerre, or just as al-Khityar, the old man.</p>
<p>Born in Cairo on August 24, 1929, he took part in battles between Arabs and Jews in the emerging Israel in 1948. He set up a successful engineering business in Kuwait before devoting himself to the cause of gaining a Palestinian homeland in 1965.</p>
<p>Arafat grabbed the headlines as spokesman for a new breed of Palestinian -- the young fedayeen, dispossessed, angry and dedicated to armed struggle against the Jewish state.</p>
<p>He remained head of the PLO through its violent ejection from Jordan in 1970 and expulsion from Beirut after the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.</p>
<p>In 1988, as the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation raged, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile chose Arafat as president of the State of Palestine, recognised by more than 70 countries.</p>
<p>For years a bachelor who said he had time only for the Palestinian struggle, Arafat in 1992 married Suha Tawil, a Palestinian Christian researcher half his age. They had a daughter last year.</p>
