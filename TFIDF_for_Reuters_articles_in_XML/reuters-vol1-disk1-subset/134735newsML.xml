<p>Iraq said on Tuesday it was trying to end the inter-Kurdish fighting in its north and condemned efforts by a senior U.S. official to bring peace to the volatile region.</p>
<p>Iraq Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz repeated his government's call for both Kurdish parties to put aside their differences and talk with Baghdad for a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The most importance thing at this time is to end fighting and prevent foreign intervention whether from the Iranian side or American and then procede toward dialogue in Baghdad between the two (Kurdish) sides,&quot; said Aziz, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency INA.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraqi leadership is exerting utmost efforts on this direction during the last few days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which last month controlled most of Iraq's Kurdish area after Baghdad backed it militarily to recapture the city of Arbil, on Monday lost the town of Ranya to the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) group. A week ago it also lost the Kurdish stronghold of Sulaimaniya.</p>
<p>Aziz criticised U.S. peace envoy Robert Pelletreau's visit to Turkey to meet KDP leader Massoud Barzani and the leader of the PUK, Jalal Talabani.</p>
<p>Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, met Barzani just over the border in Turkey on Monday. He later said the KDP leader was positive about a U.S.-proposed ceasefire with the PUK. He is due to meet Talabani on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;America is fully responsible for the destruction and explosions in the Kurdish autonomous region (Kurdish areas) because it (U.S.) is only serving its own interests,&quot; Aziz said.</p>
<p>Aziz urged the two factions &quot;to respond positively to Baghdad's appeal by ending fighting and restorting to dialogue in Baghdad.&quot;</p>
