<p>Australian Opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said on Monday the Labor Opposition was not going to be bullied in the upper house Senate as a result of the government's by-election win on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position in the Senate is absolutely justified and the measures that we will be opposing cry out to be opposed in the interests of the Australian community,&quot; Evans told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They're indefensible in terms of the pain they inflict and they're indefensible in their impact on the economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Liberal party candidate Jackie Kelly managed to retain her hold on the Sydney seat of Lindsay on Saturday to return with an increased majority -- a result the government has interpreted as an overwhelmingly endorsement of its economic policies.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard said on Sunday the government's opponents should act on the by-election message by backing its reforms in the Senate.</p>
<p>The government needs two extra votes to pass any legislation in the upper house where most of its reforms face some resistance from the other parties.  </p>
<p>Evans rejected Howard's claim that the result backed the government's economic policies, saying it was too early in the electoral cycle for the programmes to have an impact.</p>
<p>&quot;It was too early in the electoral cycle for the big national and economic and budgetary issues to bite, but it was certainly early enough for the local issues to bite back at us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think overwhelmingly that was what was crucial. We got bitten by the local factor, the fair go factor for Jackie Kelly and I think that's crucial in understanding the significance of this in the longer term.&quot;  </p>
<p>Kelly won the seat in the March 2 election from Labor candidate Ross Free, but was later disqualified because she held New Zealand citizenship and had a government job at the time of the election.</p>
<p>She quit the job, changed her citizenship and stood for the seat again.</p>
