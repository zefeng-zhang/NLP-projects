<p>The Taiwan stock index ended slightly higher on Monday after moving in a narrow range and brokers said they expected the market to stay in a consolidation in the near term.</p>
<p>The index edged 9.20 points or 0.14 percent higher to end at 6,441.15. Turnover was T$40.7 billion.</p>
<p>Most shares posted minor gains but the electronic sector saw heavy profit-taking against recent gains, losing 1.65 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The market should continue to move narrowly in the near term with no major market-moving factors at present,&quot; said Albert Lin of Golden Securities.  </p>
<p>Buying was seen in shipping stocks after the government said it was considering expanding the scope of plans for direct shipping links with rival China, brokers said.</p>
<p>Among the top 10 most active stocks, First Steamship rose 50 cents or 2.48 percent to T$20.7 and U-Ming Marine rose 40 cents or 1.44 percent to T$28.10.</p>
<p>&quot;China-related shares could be a market focus when investors are looking for an excuse to trade in a slow market,&quot; Lin said.</p>
<p>But he cautioned that direct Taiwan-China shipping links, which have been discussed for years but frustrated by political deep-seated obstacles, might not go into effect soon.  </p>
<p>Taiwan and China, separated by a civil war in 1949, still have no direct shipping, aviation or other communication links.</p>
<p>Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at its southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly across the Taiwan Strait. The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues.</p>
<p>Noting recent selling by foreign institutions, brokers said the market was likely to consolidate in a slight downtrend in the near term, with blue chips rising in turns to support the overall market. Near-term support was seen at 6,400 points.</p>
