<p>Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet said on Tuesday that French economic data in the third quarter were encouraging and added that conditions for continued economic growth were present in France.</p>
<p>&quot;The third quarter data that we have now are not the definitive data but they are encouraging, definitely,&quot; Trichet said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;The (national statistics institute) INSEE institute pointed out that the estimate for third quarter growth was probably one percent quarter-to-quarter, meaning four percent annualised and of course this is quite encouraging.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It means that since the first of January the growth in France has been probably 1.7 percent because the first quarter was 1.1, the second minus 0.4, the third plus one, so we really are experiencing regrowth now it seems.&quot;</p>
<p>He said growth in French manufacturing output, which rose 2.9 percent in July and August, was also encouraging and was not due only to a leap in car industry production.</p>
<p>The data was released earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures are obviously not due only of course to the car industry and they are probably an illustration of the picking up of the economy that we are observing not only in France but in Europe in general which is of course encouraging for all those economies,&quot; Trichet said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that the conditions for ongoing stronger growth for France in particular, but it is true also for other countries, are there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;According to the INSEE institute...the last quarter (of 1996) would also post growth. They were saying that from the first of January to the 31 of December the year-on-year growth would be something a little more than two percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As an average, because of the various profile in last year and this year, we will probably post 1.2 or 1.3 percent as an average this year and 2.3 or 2.4 percent next year,&quot; Trichet said.</p>
<p>The government is officially forecasting 1.3 percent growth this year and 2.3 percent next year.</p>
<p>Trichet said market interest rates were at 30 year lows and that now was the time to invest in France.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a very low level today and this is probably the best financial environment that we could produce for our own economy,&quot; Trichet said.</p>
<p>Trichet refused to comment on whether official interest rates would fall from their current levels.</p>
