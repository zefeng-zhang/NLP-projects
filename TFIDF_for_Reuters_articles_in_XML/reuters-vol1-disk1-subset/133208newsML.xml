<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds firmed mainly in quiet trading on Tuesday as the market was in a buying mood in the absence of negative news, dealers said.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Oct 22		  Oct 21</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    81.75-82.00	   81.40-81.70</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    58.60-58.90	   58.40-58.70</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    41.45-41.60	   41.10-41.40</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    46.50-46.80	   46.50-46.80</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    34.50-34.80	   34.50-34.80</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is more or less calm, the market is looking upwards awaiting positive news from Russia,&quot; Moscow Business World bank dealer Sergei Kovzharov said.</p>
<p>He added the forthcoming Eurobond issue was creating a positive mood on the market.</p>
<p>Vladimir Dmitriyev, deputy head of the finance ministry's foreign credit department, told Reuters on Tuesday Russia planned to issue its first Eurobond in November and will soon start a roadshow for it in major financial centres.</p>
<p>Inkombank dealer Vladislav Kovalenko said the fifth MinFin tranche was the most actively traded, with mainly foreign banks selling it in early trading but buying  back later. The fourth tranche was in demand as well, he added.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast prices would firm in the near term on a market which has been becalmed since security chief Alexander Lebed was sacked last Thursday.</p>
