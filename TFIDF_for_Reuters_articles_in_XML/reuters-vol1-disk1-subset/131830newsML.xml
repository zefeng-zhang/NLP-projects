<p>Mainland Europeans, pressed by European Union demands to break up monopolies and slash budget deficits, may well turn to Britain to learn from its extensive experience in privatising its utilities.</p>
<p>Britain took the lead in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister and started a zealous campaign which has left only a handful of companies still in state hands.</p>
<p>In the process, the Treasury was filled with 65 billion pounds ($103.2 billion), which would otherwise have had to be borrowed on capital markets resulting in a hefty interest bill for tax payers.</p>
<p>British Aerospace, British Airways, British Steel, British Telecommunications, British Gas, the electricity and water sector as well as part of the nuclear industry have all ended up in the private sector after 17 years of Conservative government.</p>
<p>The sell-off of the railways is the only major privatisation project to be completed, although the current Conservative government is still undecided whether to privatise its postal service.</p>
<p>Britons are used to fierce competition among telecom companies, while a growing number of households can choose from a wide variety of gas suppliers.</p>
<p>UNCLEAR WHETHER PRIVATISATION HAS BEEN A BLESSING OR CURSE</p>
<p>But it is far from clear whether privatisation has been a blessing or a curse. More than anything, it has yielded heated controversy.</p>
<p>Advocates generally take the line that emotions and media hype have blurred the debate, blinding people to the benefits, such as lower prices for most services.</p>
<p>&quot;Public opinion about privatisation is less positive here than it is in continental Europe,&quot; said Richard Gledhill, head of the privatisation department of consultants Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;That is odd because the continent is looking at what has been achieved in the U.K., saying &quot;that's what we want to do', while people here have already forgotten what life was like,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gledhill hardly counts as an impartial observer as he works for one of the many consultancies and banks that advised the government in its privatisation drive, critics say.</p>
<p>To them it is clear that privatisation has brought about a deterioration in services and, more importantly, poses long-term dangers to the public.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the privatised utilities are spending too much money on dividends to please shareholders, at the expense of long-term investment, for example, in a safe and reliable infrastructure for transportation of water and gas.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure for dividend payments means that corners must be cut,&quot; said Jean Shaoul, a lecturer at Manchester University and the joint author of a report highly critical of the privatised water supply sector.</p>
<p>Speaking on privatisation in general, she has a clear message for continental Europeans: &quot;Don't do it if you value public wealth over private wealth.&quot;</p>
<p>HOW SELL-OFFS PROGRESSED</p>
<p>The sell-off here began in earnest in 1981 with the public sale of 52 percent of British Aerospace.</p>
<p>The process really took off three years later when 2.3 million people bought shares in British Telecom (BT) in the world's biggest single offering at the time.</p>
<p>BT has since developed into a highly successful company, widely considered among the best telecom firms in the world.</p>
<p>In a global survey by analyst firm CIT Research, BT ranked second only to AT&amp;T of the U.S in six out of 10 categories, including service and tariffs.</p>
<p>From the outset, BT had to compete with Cable and Wireless in a regulated duopoly which was expanded in 1990. The former monopoly now faces competition from some 140 rivals, most of them cable companies.</p>
<p>The immediate exposure to competition is considered the main reason for BT's success, privatisation fans say. The more sceptical believe the technological revolution in the telecoms industry was a bigger reason for BT to improve its performance.</p>
<p>&quot;The technological changes necessitated and enabled the changes at BT,&quot; said Christine Whitehead, a lecturer at the London School of Economics.</p>
<p>CONTRAST WITH BRITISH GAS</p>
<p>In contrast, customers and shareholders of British Gas are grumbling. Complaints about poor service continue to rise and its shares languish amid the threat of new regulatory measures which could wipe hundreds of millions of pounds from annual revenues.</p>
<p>British Gas has cut thousands of jobs to fight off determined competitors. Staff are hurriedly replaced by new computer systems, but teething problems have triggered a non-stop rise of complaints over faulty bills.</p>
<p>The giant utility, which is constantly ridiculed in the media, says the government is to blame. If it had not speeded up the introduction of competition, British Gas would have had enough time to sort itself out, the company says.</p>
<p>But many experts believe its privatisation was just badly planned. From the start there should have been more incentives for British Gas to brace itself for the end of its monopoly. The company's current plan to split itself in two should have been carried out 10 years ago, experts add.</p>
<p>&quot;British Gas was simply badly prepared,&quot; said Whitehead.</p>
<p>Under the planned demerger, British Gas's trading arm will be separated from its pipeline operations, where competition cannot realistically be introduced.</p>
<p>A comparable break-up took place in the electricity industry when it was privatised in 1990.</p>
<p>In addition, the electricity supply sector -- as well as the water industry -- was broken up into regional companies. This gave the regulators a yardstick to measure which companies are efficient and which still had fat to lose.</p>
<p>But the yardstick principle is endangered by a wave of takeovers, which has left only five of the initial 12 regional electricity companies still independent.</p>
<p>The takeover frenzy has also attracted sharp criticism with the opposition Labour Party, saying shareholders rather than customers are the beneficiaries of privatisation.</p>
<p>When Southern Water, which has just been taken over, announced its results in June, Labour said it failed customers. High profits and dividends served only to highlight the booty available for predators, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The bosses...have been concentrating more on defending takeover bids than they have on making sure their customers got a decent service,&quot; said its environment spokesman Frank Dobson.</p>
<p>Utility bosses also triggered a public storm for raising their formerly modest pay packages to levels more common among top managers of listed firms.</p>
<p>British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown was the target of most criticism for accepting a 75 percent pay rise last year when the company slashed 11,000 jobs.</p>
<p>But to Price Waterhouse's Gledhill the &quot;fat cat&quot; pay debate is a sideshow, clouding the real issues. &quot;In the end it's all political football,&quot; he said. ($1=.6299 Pound)</p>
