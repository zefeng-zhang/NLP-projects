<p>Midwest cash hog prices Thursday were expected to continue the lower trend started last week amid a seasonal increase in hog numbers and subsequent pressure on hog and pork prices, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Hog prices were seen down $0.50 to $1.00 per cwt, with top prices in Iowa and southern Minnesota expected to range from $52.00 to $52.50 for hogs delivered to plants.</p>
<p>Illinois top prices also were seen ranging from $52.00 to $52.50 at plants.</p>
<p>Indiana and Ohio sources expect top plant prices to range from $52.00 to $53.00.  </p>
<p>Hog marketings were starting to slow in some areas following larger-than-expected interior movement Tuesday. Some of the hogs were animals not sold Monday because of the Labor Day holiday, sources said.</p>
<p>USDA reported interior Iowa/southern Minnesota movement Tuesday at 109,000 head which exceeded its estimate of 105,000. USDA estimated Wednesday's run at 105,000 head.</p>
<p>Hog price losses Thursday could be curbed if operating margins turn profitable for packers and plans for a large Saturday slaughter gather momentum. Margins were mixed Wednesday, depending on plant efficiency, a packer buyer said.</p>
