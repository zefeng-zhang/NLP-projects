<title>USA: Digital Q1 revenues, gross margins drop.</title>
<headline>Digital Q1 revenues, gross margins drop.</headline>
<dateline>MAYNARD, Mass. 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Digital Equipment Corp said its first quarter operating revenues dropped to $2.91 billion, from $3.27 billion last year, amid a wider-than expected first quarter loss and a drop in gross margins.</p>
<p>Digital's gross profit margins fell to 31.3 percent of revenues, down from 32.2 percent a year ago. Digital reported a first quarter loss of $66 million, or $0.48 a share, compared with a profit of $48 million, or $0.26 a share.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the consensus on Wall Street was for the computer maker to report a loss of $0.14 a share.  </p>
<p>Digital said it continues to work on improving its sales organization, one of the factors that lead to losses in is European business. It recently put its entire worldwide enterprise sales force under one management.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concentrating on substantive, permanent improvement, not quick fixes,&quot; sad Robert Palmer, Digital chairman and CEO, in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The turnaround that we continue to manage is challenging and extensive in scope,&quot; Palmer added. &quot;Despite progress we have achieved in the last two years, these results simply are not where they should be.&quot;  </p>
<p>Digital said it needed to implement a new sales model that would eventually increase the extent and effectiveness of its account coverage, but because of the changes, its first quarter got off &quot;to an even more sluggish start.&quot;</p>
<p>Sales of its Alpha system were up four percent from a year ago, a more modest growth rate that was a direct result of the changes and realignments in its sales organization.</p>
<p>Digital said its service revenues were $1.38 billion, down from $1.45 billion a year ago. Service gross margins were 31.5 percent of revenues, down from 33.8 percent a year ago. Product gross profits were 31.1 percent, versus 30.9 percent.  </p>
<p>Digital's chief financial officer, Vincent Mullarkey, said that the company made solid progress in the management of gross margins and operating expenses, despite its revenue shortfall. Total operating expenses were essentially unchanged at $900 million in the quarter.</p>
<p>Digital said that the performance of its personal computer business continued to improve and the unit made good progress toward its near-term business objectives.</p>
<p>The company said it ended the quarter with approximately 57,000 employees, a reduction of 4,500 positions versus the year-ago period, and 2,100 fewer than at the end of FY 1996.</p>
