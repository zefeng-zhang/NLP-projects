<title>GREECE: Bearish wind blows Greek shares sharply lower.</title>
<headline>Bearish wind blows Greek shares sharply lower.</headline>

<p>Greek equities, unmoved by the strong performance in other Eurobourses, coughed up 15.3 points or 1.65 percent to close sharply lower but above the session's low of 911.10 in moderate turnover.</p>
<p>The pullback was broad based with construction and small caps hard hit, both sectoral indices settling with losses above 4.0 percent, brokers said.</p>
<p>Market climate had turned bearish because of an uninspiring macro-environment, lack of cash inflows and feared tax measures with the 1997 budget next month which may hit investor pockets.</p>
<p>&quot;There is lack of cash flowing into the market, interest rates and inflation look stuck, foreign players are not very active and there is nervousness on the anticipated tax measures by the government. Petroleum is up also,&quot; said a floor trader.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a bearish mood and we could slide more. We had no strong performance after the elections and this has disappointed the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>And law 2396/96 which outlines the general framework governing the activities of firms offering investment services in Greece, harmonising Greek law with European Union legislation has sparked selling by players with long positions, he said.</p>
<p>The market was waiting to see how National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou would shape the 1997 draft budget, due by end-November. He meets Prime Minister Costas Simitis on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Athens bourse has performed badly while many other stock markets are partying. There is more downside, probably below 900 until we meet meaningful support. There the market will become quite oversold. It's cheap, but it could get cheaper,&quot; said portfolio strategist Stathis Nazos at Xiosbank.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed down 1.65 percent, or 15.30 points lower at 913.98 from Friday's 929.28 close after opening at 928.52 points.</p>
<p>Turnover fell to 6.04 billion drachmas from 10.58 billion on Friday on volume of 4.64 million shares boosted by a block trade in Mills St. George.</p>
