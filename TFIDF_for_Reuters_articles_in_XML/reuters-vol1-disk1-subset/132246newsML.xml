<p>The Netherlands' most southerly airport has bowed to public pressure and will ban all flights of Ilyshin 76 aircraft from November 15 this year, the airport operating company said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Maastricht Aachen Airport said the decision would cost the airport 800,000 guilders a year in lost turnover. But he said Maastricht's board of directors had had little option and was losing a local public relations battle by continuing to allow the Russian-built cargo aircraft to operate.</p>
<p>Ilyshin 76 aircraft had come in for mounting criticism from Maastricht-based environmental groups and residents in recent times, he said. In particular, residents claimed the aircraft was unsafe because of its typically slow climb rate and its loud engine noise.</p>
<p>Airport spokesman Cor Leverdingen told Reuters in a telephone interview: &quot;People living nearby had strong feelings that the Ilyshin 76 was unsafe although we invited them here to see the aircraft and to convince them that most of the fleet is younger than ten years. However, most people feel that they fly lower, they are nosier, and they look different. They were not popular.&quot;</p>
<p>The airport operating company said it had gone to great lengths to strike a balance between residents and the needs of air freight charter companies and charities which had been operating Ilyshin 76 aircraft to and from the airport.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the airport produced a new flight manual to persuade Ilyshin pilots to increase their angle of climb to clear the airport quicker. &quot;In spite of our special measures, a five degree climb angle is not much and still people felt that this is too low. We've had so much negative publicity because of those aircraft that now we have decided they have to go,&quot; said Leverdingen.</p>
<p>The airport's struggle to keep the aircraft was helped by a vocal group of local plane spotters, but in the end, the resident's lobby was too strong, he said.</p>
<p>Ilyshin 76 operators had already begun to get the message. Over the course of this year the number of flights per month with the aircraft has declined from between 45 and 50 a month to roughly 15 a month, the airport said. Most operators have relocated to Belgium's Ostend airport, Leverdingen added. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 7706</p>
