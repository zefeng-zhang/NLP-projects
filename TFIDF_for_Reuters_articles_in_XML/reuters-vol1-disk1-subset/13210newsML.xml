<headline>South Korea's Chun and Roh -- from power to pillory.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1996-08-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Seoul court is expected to sentence former president's Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo on Monday on charges of mutiny, treason and corruption.</p>
<p>Following are brief profiles of Chun and Roh:</p>
<p>CHUN DOO HWAN (Born January 18, 1931)</p>
<p>More than 16 years after a military coup that ushered him into the presidential mansion, the former army general is best known for a regime tainted by brutality.</p>
<p>Depite political repression, Chun's eight-year iron rule was also marked by economic prosperity.</p>
<p>State prosecutors said Chun mastermined a 1979 coup and a 1980 army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Kwangju, an event that still traumatises the nation. More than 200 people were killed by official count.</p>
<p>The aloof, ramrod-straight Chun defended his actions as necessary to save the nation from a crisis, saying North Korea contemplated invading the South after the assassination of president Park Chung-hee in October 1979.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that I would take the same action, if the same situation arose,&quot; said Chun.</p>
<p>He also denied sending troops into Kwangju, saying he was not in the chain of command.</p>
<p>Chun has lived a beleaguered existence since 1988 when he was forced to make a public apology for his own and his family's misdeeds, give up his wealth and go into exile at a Buddhist temple, accompanied only by his wife.</p>
<p>ROH TAE-WOO (Born on December 4, 1932)</p>
<p>The son of a poor farmer, Roh rose to be an army general and the first democratically-elected president in three decades.</p>
<p>But greed -- he tearfully confessed to amassing a 500 billion won (about $600 million) slush fund by twisting the arms of business tycoons -- proved his ultimate undoing.</p>
<p>A hero of South Korean forces in the Vietnam War, the much decorated Roh backed Chun, his classmate in the Military Academy, in a 1979 coup.</p>
<p>Roh rejected an offer to be rubber-stamped in office by Chun and announced in a dramatic 1987 address a popular vote for the presidency, calming student-led insurrection calling for an end to strongman rule.</p>
<p>Publicly, Roh was a suave ambassador of Korea Inc, an Asian success story that rose from the ashes of World War Two and the Korean War to become the world's 11th largest economy. His moment of greatest glory came when he presided over the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</p>
<p>Roh broke Seoul's Cold War diplomatic shackles by forging ties with the former Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc countries and China. But foreign success was undermined by domestic unrest that rocked his administration.</p>
<p>Factory workers freed from authoritarian controls turned restless, and then violent. Labour disputes halted production of cars, ships and steel.</p>
<p>South Koreans lost confidence in themselves, and in their president.</p>
<p>Two weeks before he left office, Koreans rated Roh the worst politician in the country in an opinion poll.</p>
