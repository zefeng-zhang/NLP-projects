<headline>Dollar ends lower after hitting new high versus yen.</headline>

<p>The dollar ended lower against major currencies Monday after a see-saw session where it rose against the Japanese yen, then stumbled, only to recover some ground as stocks and bonds surged.</p>
<p>The dollar also fell against the German mark after forecasts that German interest rates might rise and questions over France's fiscal preparations for a single European currency sparked a rush for the German currency.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.5105 marks from 1.5190 late on Monday and edged lower to 114.35 yen from 114.38 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar initially rose to 114.88 yen in Tokyo Tuesday -- a fresh 42-month high -- after Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in an interview with CNN that he was not concerned with the dollar's recent rise.</p>
<p>But the flight from yen was checked after Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said Japan may need to consider serious measures if the foreign exchange market gets too volatile or fails to reflect to reflect economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;There is obviously some discomfort with the levels here and I think what they are trying to do is just stem any sharp acceleration higher,&quot; David Solin, partner at consulting firm Foreign Exchange Analytics, said of the Japanese minister's comments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dollar's drop against the mark and other European currencies ended up pulling it lower against the yen, and it touched 113.50 yen before recovering some ground in U.S. trading, helped by a rally in the stock and bond markets.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 34 points to 6,007 and the 30-year Treasury jumped nearly 2 points -- lowering its yield to 6.68 percent from 6.84 percent on Monday -- after a government report that wage increases slowed in the third quarter calmed investors' worries about inflation.</p>
<p>The dollar tumbled against the mark in Europe after Germany's six leading economic research institutes issued a report saying that German interest rates were at appropriate levels but should be raised if a measure of German money supply that is a barometer of inflation remains stuck above the target range of Germany's central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;At the bottom of the story are interest rate differentials,&quot; said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank. &quot;The perception that we won't raise (interest rates) and possibly they will ... obviously it works out mark-bullish.&quot;</p>
<p>But the mark gave back some gains against the dollar after the European Commission denied reports it would reject French plans to transfer pension funds to bring its budget deficit in line with requirements for Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.2560 Swiss francs from 1.2611 on Monday and to Canadian $1.3443 from C$1.3445.</p>
<p>The British pound fell to $1.6104 from $1.6128 on Monday.</p>
