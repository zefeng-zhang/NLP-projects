<p>Eli Lilly &amp; Co said its gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72.1 percent, off from 74.3 percent in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The drugmaker's concern about the lower margin is &quot;not very high,&quot; said chief financial officer Charles Golden.</p>
<p>Last year's gross margin was boosted by a product mix dominated by high-margin products, such as Prozac, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you see a more diverse product portfolio,&quot; Golden said in a conference call with reporters after the company's release of third quarter financial results.</p>
<p>Shares in Lilly were up 1-3/8 to 70-1/8.  </p>
<p>In addition, he said, increasing sales of lower-margin drugs such as ReoPro and higher sales at the company's PCS Health Systems unit, which &quot;tends to have a dampening effect on our gross margin,&quot; Golden said.</p>
<p>Of the 2.2-point gross margin decline, PCS accounted for about a percentage point, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn't really concern us because that just shows that PCS is growing, quite frankly,&quot; Golden said.</p>
<p>He said the third-quarter margin was boosted by some productivity improvements at Lilly plants.  </p>
<p>&quot;Over the next several quarters we should really see that gross margin go up,&quot; he said, declining to quantify Lilly's expectations for margin improvement.</p>
<p>&quot;If you think about what's happening to the mix of our products ... as Zyprexa gets into the market and we see sales improve on that, that's a relatively high-margin product. Some things like that would indicate to us that our gross margin ought to be going up in the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Separately, he added, foreign-exchange translations reduced Lilly third-quarter worldwide sales by about two percent, and price pressures reduced it by about one percent.</p>
<p>Quarterly sales were $1.8 billion, up from $1.63 billion in the year-ago period.</p>
