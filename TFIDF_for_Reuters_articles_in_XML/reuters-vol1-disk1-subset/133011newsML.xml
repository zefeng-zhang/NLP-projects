<p>The Canadian Auto Workers union on Tuesday reached an agreement with General Motors Corp. to end a crippling 19-day strike by 26,000 workers that also idled 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a new 1996 collective agreement,&quot; a triumphant Canadian Auto Workers President Buzz Hargrove told a packed news conference after marathon negotiations ended.</p>
<p>The tentative three-year pact with GM's Canadian unit was reached after days of intense, round-the-clock bargaining at a downtown Toronto hotel during which several deadlines were missed as new snags cropped up in the talks.</p>
<p>GM Canada workers, fearful that the auto giant was intent on cutting its costs at the expense of union jobs, began striking Oct. 2 to back demands for a limit on contracting out jobs, known as outsourcing. The union also pressed for improvements to mandatory overtime rules and working conditions.</p>
<p>GM chief negotiator Dean Munger said the hard-fought deal was a win-win agreement for both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get it ratified. It's a good agreement. It suits our business needs and fits your members' needs,&quot; Munger told the union's negotiating team.</p>
<p>The deal was unanimously approved by the union's bargaining committee and membership meetings were set for Wednesday for the rank and file to ratify it.</p>
<p>Hargrove said workers could be back at their jobs as early as Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to moving to the future now,&quot; said Hargrove. &quot;I would have hoped we could have done it without a strike.&quot;</p>
<p>The labour pact includes a pledge by GM to recognise limits on contracting out work and allows the sale of two Ontario plants which together employ about 3,800.</p>
<p>The union, in turn, made a major concession by accepting that GM's business plan may require deviance from a pattern agreement reached in September with Chrysler Corp.</p>
<p>Munger acknowledged the workers have a &quot;right to the work&quot; as long as GM is competitive. But he said the hard-won concession gives the company freedom to tailor the collective agreement to GM's future plans.</p>
<p>&quot;The outsourcing piece, in and of itself, allows us to execute our business plans and that was what we needed to do,&quot; said Munger. &quot;We have some different plans than Ford or Chrysler, and we were able to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Hargrove said the union imposed conditions on the sale of its trim and fabrication plants in Windsor and Oshawa, Ontario, that included early retirement and buyout plans.</p>
<p>GM has agreed to guarantee that workers at those plants will have the same pension, health care benefits and insurance coverage for the next nine years, Hargrove said.</p>
<p>The new owner of the plants, thought to be New York investment firm Joseph Littlejohn and Levy, will inherit the 1996 CAW-GM master agreement for at least three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The collective agreement will be the terms and conditions of employment for the people who decide to remain with the new employer,&quot; Hargrove said.</p>
<p>The overall labour agreement includes a 2 percent wage increase for each year of the deal. Together with a cost-of-living allowance, workers will see total increases of about 10.2 percent over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>The strike paralysed GM's plants in Canada and the ripple effect caused the layoff of 20,000 GM workers in the United States and Mexico as the parts flow from Canada dried up.</p>
<p>In Canada, concern was mounting that the strike at the country's largest private employer would deliver a blow to the anaemic economy. Economists estimated a prolonged strike could shave up to one percentage point of fourth-quarter growth.</p>
<p>Hargrove and his sometimes militant membership were determined to wring concessions from GM Canada, which last year recorded the largest-ever profit by a Canadian company.</p>
<p>The talks stalled after the first week as both sides dug in. An unprecedented meeting last Wednesday at an airport hotel between Hargrove and GM Chief Executive Jack Smith broke the logjam in the crucial outsourcing issue.</p>
<p>The same day, 160 workers occupied GM's Oshawa, Ontario, plant in an effort to prevent the company from removing equipment to maintain supply to the United States.</p>
<p>The union will now turn its attention to Ford Motor Co. of Canada to forge a deal for 11,690 auto workers.</p>
<p>GM's stock gained 75 cents to end at $54.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
