<p>The first Seoul air show got underway on Monday amid fierce competition for South Korea's multi-billion dollar fighter jet and air defence contracts.</p>
<p>More than 200 exhibitors from 21 nations are eyeing Seoul's plans to spend 20 trillion won ($24 billion) by 2010 on fighter jets, surveillance planes and other defence equipment.</p>
<p>Top contenders for South Korea's next generation fighter jet programme, known as the FX project, are France's Dassault Aviation's Rafale, the U.S. Air Force's F-15E developed by McDonnell Douglas Corp, Russia's Sukhoi Su-35 and the Eurofighter 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we have a very good chance to sell our planes to South Korea because it is the best fighter there is,&quot; said Igor Emellianov, chief designer of Sukhoi's design bureau.</p>
<p>Russia, traditional political backer and military supplier to North Korea, gained a toe-hold in South Korea's military when it shipped a first load of helicopters and weaponry this year as part of payment of $150 million in overdue loans.</p>
<p>South Korea's fighter jet programme is designed to reinforce South Korea's air superiority over North Korea's MiG fighters.</p>
<p>South Korea launched its Korea Fighter Programme in the late 1980s under which it is acquiring 120 F-16 planes, 12 bought directly from Lockheed Martin, 36 assembled from kits and 72 to be produced domestically under licence, with Samsung Aerospace the main contractor.</p>
<p>South Korea plans to purchase another 120 planes under the FX programme. Whether these will be direct shipments or produced locally under licence has not been decided, South Korean defence ministry sources said.</p>
<p>The Eurofighter is made by a four-nation consortium of British Aerospace, Spain's CASA, Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG and Italy's Alenia.</p>
<p>&quot;If the decision is based on merit, the Eurofighter should win,&quot; said John Carey, a marketing director for British Aerospace.</p>
<p>&quot;But if it is based on other factors, such as politics, its still an open field.&quot;</p>
<p>Many industry sources point to the heavy advantage the United States holds due to its alliance with South Korea dating back to the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>There are 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that there is a will in the Korean government to alleviate the strong dependence on the United States,&quot; said Jean-Claude Blanvillain, Dassault's representative in Seoul. &quot;We are ready to offer as much technology as can be absorbed, the fruit of many years of engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>Billions of dollars of contracts are expected to be signed during the seven-day air show.</p>
<p>On Monday South Korea's Samsung Aerospace said it agreed to supply parts to Boeing Co to build 747-500 planes and hoped to win around $200 million in orders.</p>
<p>Korean Air Co Ltd, South Korea's national flag carrier, said it had agreed to supply $600 million worth of parts to Boeing for the same plane until 2006.</p>
<p>Korean Air plans to start designing the parts in January 1997 for production in June 1998, with first supplies to Boeing scheduled for June 1999.</p>
