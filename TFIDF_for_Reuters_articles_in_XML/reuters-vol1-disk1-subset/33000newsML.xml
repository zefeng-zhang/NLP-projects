<p>An executive director of the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that Egyptian inflation was still high but he doubted it would be easy for the government to bring it down much further.</p>
<p>Abdel Shakour Shaalan, who represents Egypt and other Arab countries on the IMF board, also said the Egyptian government should try in the long term to cut spending as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation is still in my view quite high but it has come down,&quot; he told an investment conference in Cairo.</p>
<p>Egyptian inflation has been rising throughout this year, despite tight controls on money supply and a government deficit at 1.3 percent of GDP in the financial year 1995/6.</p>
<p>It hit 8.3 percent in the year to the end of July, the highest level since 9.7 percent at the end of August last year.</p>
<p>Asked to explain the upwards trend, Shaalan said the last stages of inflation reduction were the hardest.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation gets to be sticky in this range and economists don't know why this happens. Indonesia stuck at 10 percent when it has a budget surplus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ismail Hassan, governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, told the conference that M2 money supply grew 10.5 in the 1995/6 financial year, which ended on June 30, compared with 11.1 percent in the previous year.</p>
<p>The government's budget deficit was 1.3 percent of GDP in 1995/6, lower than in most advanced industrialised economies, and the target for this year is one percent, ministers said.</p>
<p>Shaalan applauded the government's recent success in reducing the role of the state in the economy but said Egypt would benefit from even lower government spending.</p>
<p>He noted that government spending had already fallen from about 50 percent of GDP before serious economic reform began in 1991 to about 35 percent this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We still need to go lower ... Experience has shown that countries with the highest growth rates have the lowest levels of government spending. It's 18 to 20 percent in some countries in Southeast Asia,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Shaalan's advice is not likely to reflect the way the IMF board might rule on a draft agreement with the Egyptian government when it comes up for a decision on October 11.</p>
<p>Egyptian ministers say they are confident the agreement will go through, paving the way for Egypt's Paris Club creditors to write off $4 billion they have lent to Egypt.</p>
<p>Any increase in inflation is a threat to the Egyptian government's policy of maintaining the Egyptian pound at a stable exchange rate of about 3.40 to the dollar.</p>
<p>The rate has hardly changed since 1991, despite the wide gap between Egyptian pound and dollar inflation.</p>
