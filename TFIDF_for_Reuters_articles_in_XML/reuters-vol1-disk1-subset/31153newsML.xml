<title>UK: Sales triple at Britain's biggest air show.</title>
<headline>Sales triple at Britain's biggest air show.</headline>

<p>Sales have already more than tripled at Britain's biggest ever air show, giving a welcome boost to a world aerospace industry emerging from the storm clouds of recession.</p>
<p>Passenger jet rivals Boeing and Airbus Industrie alone have announced orders priced at more than $9 billion in the first three days of the show and industry sources said on Wednesday that more were in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This was in sharp contrast to the $3 billion total announced by all companies at the last Farnborough show in 1994.</p>
<p>Boeing and Airbus bickered over which had the biggest market share and argued over the value of producing a new &quot;superjumbo&quot; to cope with rising demand. But both agreed business was booming.</p>
<p>&quot;Traffic is up and airline profits are up. Our customers have emerged from some very difficult years in the first part of this decade with renewed strength and determination,&quot; said Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President Ron Woodard.</p>
<p>Airbus' chief operating officer Volker von Tein echoed his optimism.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of airlines, after many years of deficit are trading at a profit...Many of them have started to address their reflecting needs in earnest,&quot; he said at the international aviation showcase.</p>
<p>But with development costs soaring and competition intensifying, the message from industry leaders in both civil aviation and defence was the same -- mergers are vital to survival.</p>
<p>&quot;The projects of tomorrow are going to be very, very expensive,&quot; Britain's deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine told the 1,000 exhibitors from 60 nations when opening the week-long show on Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. manufacturers have bitten the bullet with a string of mega mergers. Europe will have to follow suit to compete.</p>
<p>Britain gave a welcome boost to the Eurofighter, a joint venture with Germany, Italy and Spain that had been dogged by years of political wrangling, cost overruns and technical problems.</p>
<p>It gave the production go-ahead for 232 of the 21st century combat jets. The plane was then put through its paces over the skies of Farnborough before the world's most influential buyers.</p>
<p>The members of the four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium are pressing ahead with plans to merge their civil aircraft production plants into one company.</p>
<p>But there are also aspirations within the group to take over and consolidate Europe's defence industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Potentially this is going to be the biggest industrial company in Europe,&quot; said Sir Richard Evans, chief executive of Airbus partner British Aerospace Plc.</p>
<p>The Airbus consortium said it is pressing ahead with plans to build the world's biggest passenger jet despite dire warnings from Boeing that the &quot;superjumbo&quot; market was not big enough for both of them.</p>
<p>Boeing, weighing a $5 billion plan to build a stretch version of its veteran 747 jumbo jet, said Airbus would be committing financial suicide with its $8 billion project to build the 550-seat A3XX.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to imagine that Airbus can do a totally new airplane for an $8 billion investment,&quot; said Boeing's Woodard, who launched into a dogfight with Airbus over the future of the market.</p>
<p>But the new kid on the block was unrepentant with Airbus' von Tein defiantly responding: &quot;Our A3XX will begin its life where the B747 ends.&quot;</p>
