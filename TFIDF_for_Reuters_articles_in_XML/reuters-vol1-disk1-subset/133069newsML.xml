<p>Zimbabwean industrial shares soared to record levels for the fifth consecutive day on Tuesday on growing expectations that Zimbabwe's agriculture-driven economy was set for high growth next year, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is bullish simply on sentiment. There is a strong feeling, despite some problems, that the economy will come right around the forecast seven percent growth,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hot now, and for many that's a good sign that we will get good rains and good rains are associated with high growth,&quot; he said of the southern African state.</p>
<p>The country is expected to register growth of five percent in 1996 compared with minus two percent in 1995.</p>
<p>The main 57-counter industrial jumped 41.74 points to 7,450.18 on the advances which included two bluechips, sugar producer Hippo Valley which traded 10 cents higher at 860 and Zimbabwe Sugar Refinery (ZSR) which traded 50 cents up at 1,350.</p>
<p>Gainers outpaced losers by 18 to two among industrial shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was ignoring a pay strike by local civil servants, mainly doctors and nurses, which began on Monday.</p>
<p>Among mining shares, a second consecutive 10-cent rise in nickel producer Bindura to 1,100 nudged the secondary seven-share mining index 0.82 points up to 1,254.53.</p>
