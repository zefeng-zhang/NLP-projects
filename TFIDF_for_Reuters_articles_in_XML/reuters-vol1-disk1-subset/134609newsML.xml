<p>The world refined copper surplus is likely to reach 100,000 tonnes in 1996, said Bloomsbury Minerals Economic Ltd (BME) in a press release.</p>
<p>The Western world is forecast to register a 25,000-tonne deficit, while the former Eastern Bloc is expected to register a 125,000-tonne surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the latter, however, 85,000 tonnes was absorbed by the Chinese State Reserve and is thus not overhanging the market,&quot; BME said.</p>
<p>The release said LME stocks are set to decline 200,000 tonnes between the end of January 1996 and the end of October.</p>
<p>BME said the drawdowns came in three phases -- February-April, June-July and September-October.</p>
<p>Much of the metal withdrawn in the first phase probably went to China, was customs cleared and consumed, BME said.</p>
<p>Much of the metal withdrawn from the LME and sent to China during the second phase was not customs cleared and has not been consumed, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no real reason to disbelieve the story that it is in Chinese bonded warehouses and has been returned to the State Reserve,&quot; the release said.</p>
<p>Bloomsbury said some of the third phase of stock drawdowns is headed for Shanghai and may well be for short term trading purposes, while some of the copper is for other Chinese ports and probably destined for end-use.</p>
<p>&quot;A large proportion is not headed for China at all, but for Korea and elsewhere,&quot; said BME.</p>
<p>BME said copper prices will remain firm or may strengthen further until some of the copper heading for Shanghai or already in Shanghai gets drawn back on to the LME.</p>
