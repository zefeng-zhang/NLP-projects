<headline>German DAX ends higher as Iraq tension ebbs.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>Germany's blue chip DAX index gained nearly one percent in bourse trade on Wednesday amid relief at the mild global market response to the Iraqi crisis.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX closed up 21.62 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,532.39. The level represents a rise of about three points from the post-bourse German electronic trade session on Tuesday, when the rebound began.</p>
<p>The turnaround which sent Wall Street to a higher close on Tuesday underpinned the market's bullish tone.</p>
<p>&quot;It was good to see that the U.S. has taken a relaxed approach to the Iraq situation, which seems to me just a bit of pre-election ammunition,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer.</p>
<p>Although sentiment on the market was largely favourable, the upside potential was limited because of a lack of strong buying interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very clear that Germany is not top of the buying list for investors at the moment,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>Investors were also holding off ahead of economic data due from the U.S. later this week, particularly Friday's employment data, dealers said.</p>
<p>Carmaker Volkswagen AG gained 9.50 marks to 546.50 after the European Commission ruled that it did not have to repay controversial subsidies it received to help it develop business in east Germany.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's leading commercial bank, also recovered from this week's news that three funds at its London Morgan Grenfell asset management unit had been suspended. Its shares closed up 45 pfennigs at 72.70.</p>
<p>Airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG also rebounded mildly to end up 2.30 marks at 201.50, partly making up losses suffered after its chief executive called in an interview for a wage freeeze to secure the airline's future.</p>
