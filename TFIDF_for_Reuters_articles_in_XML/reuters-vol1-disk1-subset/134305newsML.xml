<text>
<p>Northern Telecom Ltd said on Tuesday its order input rose in the third quarter to US$3.09 billion from US$2.69 billion in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The company attributed the order growth to gains in the United States, the Caribbean, Latin America and Europe over last year's levels.</p>
<p>Order input for the first nine months of 1996 rose to US$8.81 billion from US$7.25 billion in the first three quarters of 1995, Nortel said.</p>
<p>Revenues climbed to US$3.05 billion in the third quarter from year ago US$2.49 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for the quarter; but just as pleasing are recent announcements in fixed wireless access, in-building wireless and Internet solutions, with new customers,&quot; said president and chief executive Jean Monty in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;These are examples of Nortel continuing to expand its breadth of telecom network solutions to meet the needs of new customers in our industry,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>U.S. sales rose &quot;substantially&quot; in the quarter across all network businesses. There were also good gains in the Caribbean-Latin America area and in Europe and Asia Pacific.  </p>
<p>Sales in Canada also increased over the prior year.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative costs were US$526 million, or 17.2 percent of sales, in the quarter, versus US$468 million, or 18.8 percent, a year ago. For the nine months, SG&amp;A rose to US$1.51 billion from US$1.37 billion in the first nine months of 1995. The rise is due to an expected increase in investments in global markets and enterprise and wireless networks businesses.</p>
<p>Research and development spending in the quarter moved up to US$439 million, or 14.4 percent of sales, versus US$406 million, or 16.3 percent, the prior year.  </p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1996, R&amp;D expenses were US$1.29 billion, or 14.9 percent of revenues, up from US$1.13 billion, or 15.7 percent of revenues, in the same period of 1995. Nortel said this is due to its planned and ongoing investments in wireless, enterprise and broadband networks businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking forward, our current breadth of portfolio and continuing investment in international markets positions us well for our planned growth in a global industry demonstrating growth driven by de-regulation, globalization and advances in technology,&quot; Monty said.</p>
<p>&quot;This provides opportunities for companies such as Nortel that can deliver total network solutions,&quot; he added.</p>
