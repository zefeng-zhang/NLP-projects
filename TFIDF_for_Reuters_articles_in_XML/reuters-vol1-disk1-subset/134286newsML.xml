<p>The vast majority of businesses across the European Union have not even begun to consider the implications of a common currency for their firms, a sign of complacency that experts say could costs billions.</p>
<p>The impression gleaned from numerous surveys is that preparations for economic and monetary union (EMU) are being undertaken by a small coterie of big banks and businesses, with small and medium-sized enterprises left in virtual isolation.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the important reasons behind the slowness is that small and medium-sized enterprises have not been able to obtain the information they need,&quot; says Aris Pekelenburg, EMU coordinator for Eurochambres, a Brussels-based trade group representing some 1,200 chambers of commerce.</p>
<p>Experts say many companies lack the internal resources needed to plan for the transition to the single currency, the euro, and thus are more reliant on information from local chambers of commerce, government, and banks.</p>
<p>Another inhibiting factor is doubt over which countries will participate. In this regard, the level of disinterest is most striking in countries which have a slim chance of joining the first wave of members -- Greece and Portugal, for example.</p>
<p>&quot;There are basically two questions that companies want answers to: which countries will join EMU and what the exchange rate will be between the currencies,&quot; says Guenter Albrecht, chief economist at German Association of Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Bonn.</p>
<p>Since both questions cannot be answered until 1998 at the earliest, firms have remained hesistant in undertaking the kind of preparations needed to remain competitive.</p>
<p>But by doing so there is the considerable risk that the costs of changing over will become greater the closer one gets to 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The closer you get to the introduction date the more demand there will be for the services you need,&quot; added Pekelenburg of Eurochambres.</p>
<p>Another reason for planning ahead, say experts, is the possiblity that the euro will be used more actively at the start date, resulting in greater pressure on suppliers of large firms to adapt quickly.</p>
<p>Under the planned EMU transition scenario, the euro will be introduced on January 1, 1999 among banks, financial markets and governments. But national currencies will remain in circulation until 2002 at the latest, a three-year period needed for central banks to mint the new notes and coins.</p>
