<title>NEW ZEALAND: New Zealand parties launch coalition talks.</title>
<headline>New Zealand parties launch coalition talks.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand's conservative National Party and the nationalist New Zealand First Party held their first talks on coalition-building on Monday after a general election that yielded no clear winner.</p>
<p>Neither side would comment in detail on the talks, the first in a process of coalition-forming that could drag on for weeks or months.</p>
<p>New Zealand First holds the balance of power between the caretaker National government and the main opposition Labour Party after an inconclusive election on October 12.</p>
<p>New Zealand First's leader, charismatic Maori politician Winston Peters, said he would meet National again on Wednesday, the same day he plans to start talks with Labour in what he has described as a dual negotiation process.</p>
<p>&quot;We made good progress,&quot; Peters said after the first meeting, which lasted an hour and forty minutes.</p>
<p>National's Prime Minister Jim Bolger, who is in charge of a caretaker government until coalition talks are resolved, said he had no comment on the meeting.</p>
<p>Parliament is due to meet by December 13, but the parties have given no guarantees the country will know who will be able to govern by then.</p>
<p>Before going into the first meeting Peters said it would concentrate on the procedure and agenda for the talks.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has 17 members in the 120-seat parliament. National and its allies on the centre-right have 53 seats, while Labour has 37 and the left-wing Alliance won 13.</p>
<p>New Zealand First, whose policy includes curbs on foreign investment in &quot;strategic&quot; New Zealand assets, has indicated it will extract maximum concessions from its potential partners in a &quot;bidding war&quot; over policy.</p>
<p>Peters, a former National politician who formed his own party after Bolger sacked him from the cabinet in 1991, has said it would not necessarily be harmful if negotiations lasted until Christmas.</p>
<p>National, in power since 1990, has presided over a strong economic recovery but came under strong attack during the campaign from opponents promising more funding for state health and education.</p>
