<title>VIETNAM: Vietnam says no heel-dragging on HK boatpeople.</title>
<headline>Vietnam says no heel-dragging on HK boatpeople.</headline>

<p>Vietnam denied on Monday it was dragging its heels over the repatriation of boatpeople from Hong Kong and said new efforts were underway to speed up their return.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokeswoman said Hanoi had been actively cooperating with British authorities to repatriate Vietnamese nationals from the colony.</p>
<p>&quot;Recently Vietnam, Britain and Hong Kong have agreed to some measures to speed up the process... Vietnam is ready to take back 2,000 per month,&quot; she said, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman added that Vietnam was preparing to send a delegation to Hong Kong to help sort out difficult cases where problems such as a person's identity and background were causing delays in the repatriation process.</p>
<p>Vietnam's statement was in response to media queries over Hong Kong's decision last week to release 130 boatpeople from detention.</p>
<p>An official in the British colony said on Friday it had become unlawful to detain them further because Hanoi had refused to take some back, while others had been waiting clearance to be repatriated for an unreasonable period of time.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is currently a reluctant home to around 12,000 boatpeople, the last of a vast wave of humanity which began fleeing the country by sea following the end of the Vietnam war in 1975.</p>
<p>Since the late 1980s government policy has been to hold them in vast and often violent internment camps, prompting legal and moral challenges from human rights lawyers and other concerned groups.</p>
<p>Beijing has said it wants the camps cleared before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in just over eight months time.</p>
