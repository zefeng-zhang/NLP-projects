<p>A stricken Japanese fishing vessel has restarted its motors after drifting for three days because of a gas leak in the engine room which killed five of its crew.</p>
<p>Irish Defence officials said the Taisei Maru was under its own power on Sunday and was expected in the southern regional capital of Cork by Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The vessel's agents are in Cork. They are expected to send home the bodies of the five dead. Another crewman is suffering from gas inhalation.</p>
<p>The vessel, with 16 crew, was among more than 30 Japanese trawlers fishing for tuna off Ireland's West coast last week.</p>
<p>Two of the vessels were detained for fishing inside the Irish Box, the 200-mile international waters Ireland is policing for its own fishermen and licenced foreign fleets.</p>
<p>The Taisei Maru has been without power since a leak of freon gas from its refrigerating unit killed five crew in the engine room and injured one other person.</p>
<p>Crew from the Irish naval vessel the LE Aisling boarded the vessel on Saturday together with three Japanese engineers and managed to disperse the gas from the engine room and restart its motors.</p>
<p>They established that the gas had not put the engines out of action and power was restored early on Sunday, defence officials said.</p>
<p>Two Japanese captains have appeared in court in southern Ireland charged with illegal fishing and unauthorised entry into the Irish Box. Both were freed on bail and ordered to return or trial in November.</p>
<p>The Japanese fleet has been using long baited lines to catch tuna in Irish water. The tackle is thrown overboard and allowed to drift until it is picked up later.</p>
