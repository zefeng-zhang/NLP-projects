<p>Hurricane Fran forced the Atlantis space shuttle off its launching pad on Wednesday, delaying by several days the return of U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid from Russia's Mir space station.</p>
<p>Although the hurricane was expected to pass well offshore, NASA officials ordered the shuttle back to its hangar as a precaution.</p>
<p>&quot;There were too many unknowns about what it was going to do,&quot; NASA spokesman George Diller said.</p>
<p>Atlantis was due to be launched on Sept. 14 but will now face a two-day delay, space agency officials said. The shuttle could be back on the pad as early as Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The mission to pick Lucid up and drop off her replacement is already running six weeks late because of problems with the spaceship's booster rockets.</p>
<p>Lucid, a biochemist and 53-year-old mother of three, has been working aboard the orbiting station since March and was originally due home in early August. NASA officials said they had told her of the latest delay.</p>
<p>Former astronaut Frank Culbertson, who heads NASA's shuttle-Mir programme, informed Lucid of the delay by telephone from his home in Houston via Russia's mission control.</p>
<p>&quot;Her only reaction was just that we should look after Atlantis and she'd still be there waiting for us,&quot; NASA spokesman Rob Navias said.</p>
<p>It was the second time in two months the weather had forced Atlantis to take shelter. The shuttle scurried back to its assembly building in July when Hurricane Bertha threatened the Florida coastline.</p>
<p>Hurricane Fran is also likely to delay the planned Oct. 31 launch of the shuttle Columbia, because work to assemble its booster rockets has been held up for almost a week while NASA waited for the storm to pass.</p>
