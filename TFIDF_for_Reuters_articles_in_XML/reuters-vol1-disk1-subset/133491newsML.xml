<title>CHINA: China ripe for mutual funds industry - Levitt.</title>
<headline>China ripe for mutual funds industry - Levitt.</headline>

<p>China should look to mutual funds as a means of tapping its huge reservoir of personal savings to spur economic growth, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>China had funds sitting in savings accounts but a lack of investment alternatives had hindered efficient use of this resource, Levitt told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of the mutual fund industry is a logical way of accomplishing that goal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Levitt said he told top Chinese financial officials that mutual funds would have to offer a product that included a solid array of companies able to lure potential investors.</p>
<p>&quot;That product can't be just large, well-established industrial companies; it has to include growth companies and high-tech companies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Levitt said he had stressed the importance of a legal foundation for an emerging mutual funds industry and that he had cautioned Beijing that handing management of the new sector to banking regulators could be a mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;I had hoped that the oversight of the mutual funds industry would rest in the hands of securities regulators rather than banking regulators,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;One means safety and security and the other being entrepreneurship and risk-taking.&quot;</p>
<p>Levitt said his round of meetings with Chinese officials had led him to believe that regulation of mutual funds would go to the securities industry watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>Levitt said he had met with vice-premier and chief economic strategist Zhu Rongji, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission Zhou Daojiong and senior officials from the People's Bank of China, the central bank.</p>
