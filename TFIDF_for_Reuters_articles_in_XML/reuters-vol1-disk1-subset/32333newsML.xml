<p>Neutral Sweden, made to blush when it was revealed it had long mistaken swimming minks for Soviet submarines, turned a deeper shade of scarlet on Wednesday when Russia accused two Swedes of spying.</p>
<p>An embarrassed silence descended over one of Europe's most open governments after allegations erupted in the Russian media that a Swedish defence worker and a senior diplomat in Moscow had been caught spying and expelled from the country.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Goran Persson cut short a visit to neighbouring Denmark. His staff said the change was because of urgent labour market talks back in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Even Swedish parliamentary leaders protested that they had been kept in the dark about the allegations.</p>
<p>Russian media said 32-year-old Hans Peter Nordstrem had been arrested in St Petersburg in February as he took a roll of film from a Russian contact and handed him money.</p>
<p>Sergei Gorlenko, a spokesman for Russia's FSB Federal Security Service, told NTV television Russia had decided to quietly expel Nordstrem as a &quot;neighbourly&quot; act but added that other Swedes, travelling as businessmen, had also been caught with film of secret Russian installations in the past year.</p>
<p>NTV broadcast footage it said showed the bespectacled Swede handing $2,000 in cash to a Russian in St Petersburg's naval museum in exchange for a painted wooden &quot;matrioshka&quot; doll containing, not the traditional collection of smaller dolls, but a roll of film.</p>
<p>Other film showed Nordstrem being hustled away by men in civilian clothes and being interrogated in the presence of the Swedish consul who, NTV said, pleaded for his countryman's release by saying: &quot;We Swedes are a rather naive nation.&quot;</p>
<p>Nordstrem -- who is employed by Swedish defence company Celsius -- was interviewed by Swedish television and protested his innocence. &quot;Someone has tried to trick me. The person I was doing business with wasn't who he appeared to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no comment to make,&quot; a subdued Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen told Swedish television.</p>
<p>A colleague at Celsius told Swedish radio Nordstrem was involved in work with the Swedish jet fighter Jas Gripen.</p>
<p>Russian media said a senior diplomat at Sweden's Moscow embassy had also been expelled after the man was caught spying.</p>
<p>FSB spokesman Boris Kostenko confirmed to Russia's Interfax news agency that Nordstrem and a Russian working for Swedish military intelligence had been held last winter.</p>
<p>Sweden has for many years carried out regular expulsions of Soviet diplomats from Stockholm, alleging wholesale spying on its military installations.</p>
<p>Stockholm says it does not engage in foreign espionage activities, a claim scoffed at by western intelligence experts, although they say Sweden's foreign espionage agents are few compared to bigger countries.</p>
<p>A former colleague of Nordstrem's at Sweden's military defence research organisation FOA said the man had been involved there in underwater hunts for Soviet submarines, most of which -- it transpired last year -- turned out to have been small minks swimming in Sweden's waters.</p>
<p>An abashed Swedish navy admitted its sonar operators had mistaken the trail of the tiny furry animals for a giant Soviet sub.</p>
