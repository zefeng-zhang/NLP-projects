<dateline>ATHENS 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Greek short term depos and forex forwards continued to dip in light dealing with one-month swap rates down by 50 basis points, offered around 12.40 percent since the easing began on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a follow up to late Monday's easing in depos and swaps, we are returning to the starting point before the auction. We might have another 10 basis points to go,&quot; said a money market dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;The FRN auction will be settled tomorrow and 325 billion of o/n funds will leave the system but there will still be surplus funds and the Bank of Greece will stay on the bidside in the overnight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Greece auctioned 250 billion drachmas of seven-year floaters with the first coupon set at 14 percent on Monday, October 21.</p>
<p>The average price was a touch above par, 100.001475. The minimum accepted price was 99.9211, the highest 100.25. The floaters mature October 2,3 2003.</p>
<p>The spread was held constant at 150 basis points but the benchmark 12-month T-bill is slashed by 20 basis points to 12.50 percent. The latest one-year T-bill rate was 12.70 percent.</p>
<p>The treasury reserved the right to accept non-competitive bids up to 30 percent of the auctioned amount, it said. It also reserved the right not to accept all or some of the competitive bids that will be submitted.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 156.27/37 drachmas from Tuesday's 156.360 fix, the dollar at 239.72/82 drachmas from 239.980 and the Ecu at 300.17/27 from 300.280 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;There were sales of marks, ecus and dollars at the fixing, about $190 million worth, with an October 24 value date and this resulted in drachma inflows,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece , the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 12.10-12.60</p>
<p>** T/N at 12.10-12.60</p>
<p>** S/N at 12.10-12.60</p>
<p>** One week at 12.10-12.60</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 12.15-12.65</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 12.20-12.70</p>
<p>** One month at 12.20-12.70</p>
<p>** Two months at 12.25-12.75</p>
<p>** Three months at 12.30-12.80</p>
<p>** Six months at 12.35-12.85</p>
<p>** Nine months at 12.40-12.90</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 12.50-13.00</p>
