<p>Thailand's election campaign began on Monday with former prime minister Chuan Leekpai and ambitious ex-army chief Chavalit Yongchaiyudh emerging as close rivals for the top government job after the November 17 polls.</p>
<p>Chuan's Democrat Party and Chavalit's New Aspiration Party (NAP) dominated the first day of registration of candidates vying for the 393 seats in the lower House of Representatives.</p>
<p>At least 2,000 candidates are expected to register this week.</p>
<p>The Democrats, who headed a 35-month coalition government from 1992-1995, said they plan to field about 374 candidates and expect at least 120 to be elected, up from 86 seats won in the last election in July 1995.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the Democrat party, which led the opposition in the past 14 months, has gained popularity among the business community, urban and young voters this year because of its image as a party with the most qualified economic team.</p>
<p>Thailand's slowing economy and sluggish exports are a major election issue. Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa was accused of economic mismanagement during a no-confidence debate against him in September, shortly before he called the November snap poll.</p>
<p>Chuan, perceived as the most modest and least corrupt among Thai political leaders, is running for a seat in his hometown in southern Trang province where he will likely win unopposed.</p>
<p>The NAP, a medium-size party in the 1995 poll, has become potentially the biggest and best-financed organisation, benefitting the most from recent party switching of politicians, especially from Banharn's fractious Chart Thai Party.</p>
<p>Chavalit's deputies projected the NAP, which was in Banharn's coalition government, would maintain control of its northeast region stronghold where 137 MP seats, slightly more than one third of the total, are at stake.</p>
<p>The NAP, sponsoring more than 300 candidates nationwide, has vowed to improve on its previous performance in the northeast where it captured 36 seats in the last poll.</p>
<p>Former defence minister Chavalit pledged in the past week that he would turn the region, Thailand's traditional backwater, into an economic powerhouse by building roads and infrastructure if the NAP was given a mandate to form the next government.</p>
<p>NAP secretary-general Snoh Thienthong, who defected from Chart Thai, predicted on Monday his party would win at least 130 seats with 119 incumbent members of parliament running under its banner, against 97 former MPs campaigning as Democrats.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a photo finish with the NAP enjoying a slight edge. If NAP and Democrat retained respective grips on the northeast and the south, Bangkok will be the deciding factor,&quot; said Chaiwat Kamchu, political lecturer at Chulalongkorn University. The Democrats hope to win 20-25 of Bangkok's 37 seats, up from seven in 1995.</p>
<p>Democrat candidate Thawatchai Sachakul said on Monday: &quot;If the Democrats are not given the mandate, the other party (NAP) will definitely be returned and economic problems will be left unresolved. We will see Banharn Part Two.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the third most likely candidate for prime minister is Chart Pattana leader Chatichai Choonhavan, 74, who may emerge as a compromise choice.</p>
<p>Chatichai, whose previous premiership was cut short by a military coup in 1991, has pledged that under his leadership, Thailand would see a more robust economy similar to the economic boom it enjoyed in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
