<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS - ANI annual meeting adjourns.</title>
<headline>RTRS - ANI annual meeting adjourns.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The annual meeting of engineering group Australian National Industries Ltd (ANI) adjourned after nearly two hours on Monday with shareholders yet to vote on motions for the removal of two directors who are feuding over the acquisition of a German subsidiary in 1991.</p>
<p>ANI chairman Ted Harris rejected a suggestion from one shareholder that the two directors, Ross Palmer and Peter Joseph, spend &quot;five minutes out the back&quot; to discuss their disagreement over the board's handling of the acquisition.  </p>
<p>Palmer, the largest personal shareholder in ANI with a stake of about five percent, has criticised Joseph and some other directors for their handling of the purchase of Holter.</p>
<p>Joseph, an independent director along with Palmer, has institutional support for Palmer's removal from the board, according to various fund managers and newspaper reports.</p>
<p>Joseph has said he will resign immediately if Palmer is re-elected.</p>
<p>Joseph is himself facing a motion brought by Palmer to be dismissed from the board but his re-eletion has received the support of Harris and managing director Peter Stancliffe.  </p>
<p>Shareholders have grilled the ANI chairman over the company's 1995/96 profit results, its auditing, the independent legal inquiry into the Holter acquisition.</p>
<p>ANI reported a loss of A$213.19 million for the year to June 30 compared with a profit of A$80.38 million a year earlier.</p>
