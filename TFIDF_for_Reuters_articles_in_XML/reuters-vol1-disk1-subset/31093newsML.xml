<headline>Prompt West African crude discounted as arb closes.</headline>

<p>A large quantity of West African crude loading in September was still unsold and prices were under pressure on Wednesday because of the recent peculiar strength of benchmark Brent relative to prices elsewhere in the world, West African oil traders said.</p>
<p>Forcados, Qua Iboe, Brass River, Bonny Light, Escravos, Palanca and Rabi were all still available for mid-September loading, but one trader expected many surplus cargoes to be shipped out to the U.S. by trading companies betting that the arbitrage will reopen within a week or two.</p>
<p>The premium of NYMEX WTI crude futures to Brent fell by 28 cents from Friday to Tuesday to $1.19 per barrel and the value of Asian benchmark Dubai crude relative to Brent slumped by 90 cents to $2.33 in the same period.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe the (NYMEX crude) WTI/Brent will stay this weak...I think a lot of the big arb players will sail to the U.S. and sell delivered,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Nigerian and Angolan crude loading in the period September 10-20, let alone in the last decade, was still on offer and traders say the premiums for prompt crude may be discounted heavily to counteract the strength of Brent's backwardation.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of all the Western crude markets, West African is under most pressure. With the backwardation steepening, they will have to discount the September barrels further to compete with October,&quot; a trader said.</p>
