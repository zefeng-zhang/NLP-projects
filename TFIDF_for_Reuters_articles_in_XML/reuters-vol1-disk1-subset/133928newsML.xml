<p>The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Russia's control over its nuclear arsenal has been weakening, but the chance of unauthorised launch or blackmail remained low, CIA officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian nuclear command and control system is being subjected to stress that it was not designed to withstand as a result of wrenching social change, economic hardship and malaise within the armed forces,&quot; according to a classified report prepared last month, the officials said.</p>
<p>The CIA report, titled &quot;Prospects for Unsanctioned Use of Russian Nuclear Weapons&quot; and stamped top secret, was disclosed by the Washington Times in its Tuesday editions. CIA officials confirmed the accuracy of the material from the spy agency quoted in the article while voicing concern over its public disclosure, the latest in a series of sensitive intelligence documents leaked to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The Times cited the report as warning of &quot;conspiracies within nuclear-armed units&quot; to commit blackmail involving the arsenal of 28,000 nuclear-tipped weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;This has become a concern as living conditions and morale have deteriorated in the military, even among elite nuclear submariners, nuclear warhead handlers and SRF (Strategic Rocket Forces),&quot; the CIA analysis said.</p>
<p>Controls over tactical nuclear weapons -- battlefield nuclear arms and nuclear torpedos -- were rated poor by CIA analysts, who typically draw on many sources, including insiders, to make such judgments.</p>
<p>&quot;These appear to be the weapons most at risk,&quot; the report said, adding that safeguards on all Russian nuclear devices can be defeated, &quot;probably within weeks or days depending on the weapon involved.&quot; The report said Russian officials were particularly worried about nuclear units in the Far East, &quot;where troop living conditions are particulary deplorable.&quot;</p>
<p>But in what CIA officials called their key conclusion, the analysis said that &quot;under normal circumstances the prospect of an unauthorised nuclear-missile launch or a blackmail attempt using nuclear arms is low, despite continuing turmoil, political uncertainty and disarray in the armed forces.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A severe political crisis, however, could exacerbate existing dissension and factionalization in the military, possibly heightening tensions between Russian political and military leaders and even splitting the general staff or nuclear commands,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Bruce Blair, a former U.S. nuclear missile launch officer who has written extensively on the Russian nuclear control system and who had seen the CIA report, said the agency's conclusion seemed to unduly play down the threat of rogue action up and down the chain of command.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the report concludes that the danger is low, it contains a litany of weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Russian nuclear control,&quot; Blair, who specialises in Russian and U.S. nuclear control at the private Brookings Institution, said in a telephone interview. &quot;When I add them up, the risk looks serious.&quot;</p>
<p>The CIA's assessment of slipping Russian control over nuclear weapons contrasted with the generally more upbeat picture sketched by President Bill Clinton and top aides. U.S. officials have said Moscow exercises tight central control over the approximate 6,000 strategic and 22,000 tactical nuclear arms at about 60 sites.</p>
<p>Disclosure of the CIA report bolstered Clinton critics, many of them backers of Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, who favour building a costly missile defence system over administration objections that it could undermine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;It reinforces the urgent need for a missile defence to be put in place as soon as possible for the United States as well as for its allies and friends,&quot; said James Lilley, a Dole supporter who served as U.S. ambassador to China and South Korea under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.</p>
