<p>Shell's budget-strapped Nigerian oil operations could easily double output from already discovered crude reserves if government funding problems are resolved, the company's managing director in the country, Brian Anderson, said.</p>
<p>Shell's Nigerian joint venture, now producing 930,000 barrels per day (bpd), is aiming for a new plateau of at least two million bpd by 2010, Anderson told reporters in Lagos.</p>
<p>&quot;We're aiming at two million-plus by 2010 but that excludes the new deepwater operations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shell currently pumps just under half the country's two million bpd in partnership with state Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.</p>
<p>Anderson said the government's failure to meet its funding obligations through a 55 percent share in the Shell joint venture had hobbled crude output over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Shell expects the military government to embark on a phased five-year sale of the oil sector which would take financing out of state hands.</p>
<p>Arrears to all joint venture operators in Nigeria now amounted to the equivalent of $500 million in total in dollar and naira payments, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Shell Petroleum Development Co of Nigeria underspent its budget last year and has been promised less than it asked for in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we had an approved budget of just of $1.5 billion, we ended spending just over a billion,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;We wanted to make the point that we can't go on investing if they don't pay their share.&quot;</p>
<p>The company proposed a $1.63 billion budget for this year but expects the joint venture to get just $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>It was aiming for a $1.96 billion budget next year, rising to over $2 billion in 1998.</p>
<p>To fill the gap before the expected government oil sector sale, Anderson said Shell Nigeria was considering raising extra capital on the domestic market.</p>
<p>He said he did not expect the government to take a hard line on new orders from Oil Minister Dan Etete threatening expropriation of undeveloped oilfields licensed to Shell to 2025.</p>
<p>&quot;I think  the government will be cautious about this. It would be a bad signal when you're trying to sell equity. We have an acreage agreement and we expect it to be honoured.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson said Shell's Nigerian operations continued to be hit occasionally by sabotage following an oilworkers' strike in 1994 which cut production.</p>
<p>&quot;Sabotage continues all the time. Thirty percent of leaks are caused by sabotage.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson said he closed down Shell's dry land operations to protect company staff in Nigeria during the strike in support of jailed presidential candidate Moshood Abiola.</p>
