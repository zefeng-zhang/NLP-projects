<p>The Export-Import Bank of Japan said on Tuesday that it had agreed with commercial banks to provide a loan totalling 13.62 billion yen ($120 million) to Turkmenistan to help upgrade its oil refining industry.</p>
<p>The Ex-Im Bank said that it would provide 60 percent of the total, or 8.17 billion yen ($72.3 million), its first loan to the former Soviet republic. The remainder would be co-financed by three Japanese banks and lead managed by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>The facility will enable Turkmenistan to produce unleaded gasoline at the country's largest refinery.</p>
<p>This project is expected to help develop Turkmenistan's oil industry and to diversify the economy, which is heavily dependent on natural gas production, the bank said. The upgrading will also reduce air pollution, it said.</p>
<p>Japan is increasingly directing aid to central Asian nations such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. The area, rich in resources such as gas and oil, could be of strategic importance to Japan, which meets most of its energy needs through imports.</p>
<p>The Ex-Im Bank is a semi-governmental body providing funds on easy terms, often to overseas development projects. ($1=113 yen)</p>
