<p>Blackburn Rovers, currently lying bottom of the English premier league and without a win this season, have expressed an interest in buying Brazilian striker Bebeto.</p>
<p>Blackburn, looking for a replacement for England striker Alan Shearer who was sold to Newcastle United for a world record 15 million sterling ($24 million), said the 32-year-old South American wanted to move to England from Brazilian club Flamengo.</p>
<p>British newspapers on Tuesday quoted Blackburn manager Ray Harford as saying: &quot;There is no questioning the fact that he is a sensational player, one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems he is very keen to come to England. He has seen the likes of Juninho do well over here and believes it offers a new challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspaper reports said Harford had been contacted by Bebeto's agent and that the player was expected to cost around five million sterling ($8 million) in fees and wages. He moved to Flamengo from Spanish side Deportivo Coruna at the end of last season.</p>
