<p>Indonesian coffee prices were lower on Monday following a pounding of New York and London values last Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>They said grade four Robusta was quoted at 2,600-50 rupiah/kg in the key growing region of Lampung in South Sumatra, compared with 2,700-800 rupiah a week ago.</p>
<p>The export price fob Lampung was quoted at around $1,200/tonne, down from $1,230 last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Local prices are adjusting to the falls in New York and London,&quot; one Lampung trader said. &quot;I think London prices will be stable on support when the market opens today.&quot;  </p>
<p>London's January robusta contract came under heavy selling last Friday due to origin selling, especially from Vietnam and Indonesia, dragging it to a low of $1,380/tonne before it recovered to $1,397.</p>
<p>The November contract ended $14 lower at $1,507.</p>
<p>Producer and speculative-selling also dragged down New York prices on Friday, rounding up a week of sharp losses in which the market pulled back six percent from recent highs.</p>
<p>One Indonesian trader said there was some light buying by players who were short but activity was generally quiet in the wake of the price adjustment to New York and London.  </p>
<p>&quot;If I were to sell at prices sought by buyers, I will be making a loss,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The general attitude of the market at the moment is to wait and see.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders' estimates of coffee in the hands of exporters and traders at the end of the main September harvest ranged from 30,000 tonnes to as much as 50,000 tonnes.</p>
