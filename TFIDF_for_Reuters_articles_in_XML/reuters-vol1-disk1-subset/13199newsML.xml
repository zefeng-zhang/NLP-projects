<p>Asia, home to some of the world's heaviest smokers, is attempting to stamp out the habit by introducing new rules similar to those recently announced in the United States targeting young people.</p>
<p>A ban on tobacco advertising is being sought in China by 2000, an Australian state is set to fight under-age smoking with new laws while Singapore occasionaly rounds up underage smokers.</p>
<p>Japan is beginning to acknowledge non-smokers' rights but smokers in India continue to puff away.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton, expanding the federal role in fighting teen smoking, on Friday took on powerful U.S. tobacco interests and announced strict rules to control tobacco sales and advertising -- including proof of age to buy cigarettes.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, vending machines that sell cigarettes would be banned from places teenagers can go, and billboards advertising cigarettes would be prohibited within 1,000 feet (300 metres) of schools and playgrounds.</p>
<p>Sales or giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco product brand names or logos would also be prohibited.</p>
<p>China recently mounted a drive to curb the growth of its 300 million-strong army of smokers, estimated to be expanding by two percent a year, but health campaigners say the importance of tobacco tax revenues makes progress difficult.</p>
<p>In January this year, health officials launched a campaign to ban tobacco advertising by 2000. A law launched in February 1995 banned tobacco advertising in many public places, including sports stadiums, but cigarette company sponsorship of sporting events has survived the advertising law.</p>
<p>By May this year, 30 Chinese cities had banned smoking in public places such as hospitals, libraries and stadia, but so far the restrictions appear to have had little effect.</p>
<p>In Beijing, the fine for people who violate the ban is just 10 yuan ($1.20) -- less than the price of a packet of foreign cigarettes -- and enforcement is the responsibility of volunteers and not the police.</p>
<p>The environment is quite different in Singapore, however, which continues to strictly enforce some of the world's most Draconian anti-smoking legislation.</p>
<p>The city-state launched its first anti-smoking measures in 1970 and since then has gradually toughened up the rules against the promotion and consumption of tobacco.</p>
<p>Over the last few years it has barred smoking in government buildings, restaurants, department stores, public lifts, taxis, busses, air-conditioned offices on factory floors and even in its outdoor National Stadium.</p>
<p>Offenders can face fines of Singapore $1,000 (US$709).</p>
<p>Singapore bans smoking by those under 18 in public places and police have gone on several highly-publicised round-ups of teenagers smoking in parks and other youth hang-outs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Japan, fairly liberal in its attitude towards tobacco smoking, has only recently started to acknowledge the rights of non-smokers. About 36.3 percent of 11,256 Japanese surveyed in 1995 said they smoke.</p>
<p>Offices, particularly in major business centres such as Tokyo, have designated separate places for smoking, and some railways have a separate smoking corner on the platforms.</p>
<p>Australia has required health warnings on cigarette packets since 1972 and bans most forms of tobacco advertising -- print and broadcast media, cinemas, billboards and most sporting sponsorships.</p>
<p>The minimum age varies between states from 16 to 18 but the most populus state, New South Wales, is set to introduce legislation requiring proof of age to be shown when buying tobacco from October 1.</p>
<p>In India, tobacco advertisements are banned on state-run television and radio but not in independent media though several publications have voluntarily banned tobacco ads.</p>
<p>Advertisers increasingly sponsor sporting events to indirectly gain more mileage in popular audio-visual media. India's biggest cigarette maker ITC Ltd sponsored this year's World Cup cricket in the subcontinent, but attracted protests.</p>
<p>But there is no organised or commonplace social opposition to smoking in public, except often-ignored notices on railway coaches asking smokers to have concern for fellow passengers.</p>
