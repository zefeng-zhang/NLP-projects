<p>Bangladeshis with problems from obseity to premature ejaculation are being lured by a range of cures that doctors dismiss as nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;No erection? Premature ejaculation? Nothing to worry about ... we can help, with a 100 percent guarantee,&quot; a healer promises in one of hundreds of newspaper advertisements.</p>
<p>Many ads also guarantee fast results.</p>
<p>&quot;A 70-year-old man will feel young again within days and will feel like a stallion. His wife will be more than happy...&quot; says another.</p>
<p>Other advertised cures cover diseases from cancer to AIDS to whooping cough, diabetes and piles.</p>
<p>Treatment costs are very low and claimed success rates are high. The healers print testimonials from former patients happy with the results, along with their photographs.</p>
<p>One Dhaka-based firm offering a cure for obesity claims its clients can slim down to a &quot;fine-tuned body&quot; without any physical exercise or even without changing diet.</p>
<p>&quot;Why worry? Eat, drink and be merry. Leave the rest to us,&quot; one firm's official said.</p>
<p>He says patients also come from abroad, especially from India, where thousands of Bangladeshis also head for treatment every month.</p>
<p>&quot;Our people go to India because they are still ignorant of the tremendous power of our medicine and treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>Other healers appearing in the newspapers include one who can &quot;guide your future with direction received through dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>Some rely on the divine power of stones.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want? I can give you wealth, a happy soul, financial prosperity, great success and the solution to any problem you may have,&quot; says healer Dewan Golam Sarwar.</p>
<p>Woman healer Sufia Begum promises in her advertisement in Ittefaq newspaper: &quot;My challenge...healing or cure is available through believing only.&quot;</p>
<p>She says she can cure the &quot;hardest of problems, including pains from broken love, simply by the power of meditation.&quot;</p>
<p>Other healers use substances extracted from snakes, water from the Holy Land, dew drops and Kastari, a rare fragrance derived from deer.</p>
<p>At shops called Dawakhana, practitioners of herbal medicine treat patients from all over the country, most of them unable to afford expensive care in hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>The patients often undergo an initial psychological session, where they are told by the hakims (physicians) that the main healer is Allah.</p>
<p>&quot;We just deliver the cures offered by our creator,&quot; one Hakim said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a cooling feeling inside me. I felt good and a little relieved too,&quot; one patient at a Dawakhana said after his psychological session.</p>
<p>The medicines are cheap, made from herbs and taken easily, though some have a bad taste, another patient said.</p>
<p>How reliable are they?</p>
<p>Doctors who studied advanced medical science say most of the cures are ineffective, except for some herbal medicines.</p>
<p>&quot;Homoeopathy is the only reliable alternative to allopathy (orthodox medicine),&quot; Dr Mamoon Ahmed said. &quot;Herbal medicines sometimes work, only if the disease can be properly diagnosed. But it's not possible without advanced scientific research.&quot;</p>
<p>Doctors also dismissed street-side healers, who deliver lectures over megaphones, and offer money back guarantees if their medicines do not work.</p>
<p>&quot;They simply cheat people,&quot; one said.</p>
