<title>UK: NHL completes 1996 financing plans.</title>
<headline>NHL completes 1996 financing plans.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>National Home Loans Holdings completed its financing for the year with the launch of a 448.4 million stg mortgage-backed FRN on Tuesday, finance director Nicholas Keen told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This completes our programme for the year. But we have a number of old transactions which we expect to refinance in the future, possibly early next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Keen said the motivation for today's Homeloans No.3 Plc issue was two-fold: &quot;It is partly to provide financing for our new mortgage loans, and also to refinance at more attractive rates.&quot;  </p>
<p>Keen said the four-tranche structure was the most effective, given the mix of assets and range of investors being targeted. &quot;The market has been looking for good quality sterling assets.&quot;</p>
<p>ING Barings and J.P. Morgan were joint lead managers on the class A1, A2 and B notes, while J.P. Morgan was sole lead manager on the class C notes.</p>
<p>Syndicate officials said there had not been much issuance in the sterling mortgage-backed sector this year.  </p>
<p>&quot;It (the bond) is principally the refinacing of various NHL originated securitisations which had been launched in around 1989/1990 and which had become expensive,&quot; a syndicate official at one of the joint leads said.</p>
<p>&quot;This has cleaned up or tidied up a number of their older issues that were getting smaller and more expensive to run.&quot;</p>
<p>Keen said National Home Loans was also originating consumer loans, backed by car loans, with the intention to &quot;mix them&quot; with home loans.  </p>
<p>On Monday, NHL Holdings conditionally agreed to buy a residential mortgage loan portfolio from an undisclosed British bank subsidiary for about 44 million stg.</p>
<p>Keen said that would also be refinanced in this bond.</p>
<p>Homeloans No. 3 follows Homeloans No. 1 issued in December 1995 -- a two-tranche 122.5 million stg FRN -- and Homeloans No. 2 this June -- a three-tranche 242.50 million stg FRN.</p>
<p>Today's deal comprised class A1 (135 million stg) and A2 notes (252.05 million stg), both rated Aaa by Moody's.</p>
<p>The A1 notes have an average life of 1.1 years, while the A2 notes have an average life of 4.8 years.</p>
<p>Class B notes (30.1 million stg) are rated A2 by Moody's and have an average life of 5.7 years. Class C notes (31.25 million stg) are rated Baa3 and have an average life of 5.7 years.</p>
