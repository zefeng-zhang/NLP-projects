<p>The European Commission (EC) is growing increasingly irritated at farmers' reluctance to release a record harvest on to domestic markets and help push prices down to more competitive international levels.</p>
<p>Commission grain officials delivered the message bluntly at a recent meeting with farmers, farm cooperative and grain trade representatives, saying prices were too high given a harvest of over 200 million tonnes, up 15 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Farmers, flush with funds from generous set-aside schemes and record world prices early in 1996, are in no hurry to sell.</p>
<p>&quot;High domestic prices are holding up EU (European Union) exports,&quot; said a Commission source, noting export subsidies could only be used sparingly to close the gap with lower world levels.</p>
<p>European exporters are frustrated at the slow pace of shipments, especially wheat, this season.</p>
<p>Brussels is anxious not to renew a grain subsidy war after warnings from Washington against accelerating sales by sharply undercutting U.S. prices.</p>
<p>U.S. agriculture official Gene Moos said in Paris on Sunday the U.S. is ready to think about bringing back export subsidies for its wheat if recently revived EU subsidies rock the world grain market.</p>
<p>&quot;We would certainly review it at that point,&quot; Moos said, asked by Reuters whether Washington would bring out subsidies if the EU started competing with cheaper wheat from Argentina.</p>
<p>In Washington on Friday, U.S. Agriculture senior trade adviser Paul Drazek said that subsidies were unnecessary.</p>
<p>&quot;They (EU) should adjust their domestic price so that they don't need export subsidies,&quot; Drazek told Reuters.</p>
<p>A massive EU grain harvest this year, due to high favourable weather and a big increase in plantings as farmers seized on high prices, should mean greater export opportunities.</p>
<p>But the EU must hurry up before cheap southern hemisphere producers, notably Argentina and Australia, start harvesting bumper crops.</p>
<p>&quot;The EU's window of opportunity may soon be shut,&quot; said a worried trade source.</p>
<p>The Commission, afraid of stirring up the markets, has been exceptionally coy about making harvest estimates, leaving it to trade and producer associations to shed some light on supplies.</p>
<p>Although estimates have been rising steadily, last week's total of 205.1 million tonnes from COPA, the EU farmers' organisation, surprised many agriculture watchers.</p>
<p>In June, COPA put the crop at 190 million tonnes, up from 175 million tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>Farmers' forecasts usually tend to be pessimistic and bullish for prices.</p>
<p>But this time their forecast is four million tonnes higher than that of COCERAL, the EU grain traders' association.</p>
<p>One source suggested that the COPA total merely represented raw figures from member state farm organisations and had not been weighted to remove inconsistencies.</p>
