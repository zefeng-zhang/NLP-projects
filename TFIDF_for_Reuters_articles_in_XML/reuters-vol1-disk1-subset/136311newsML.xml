<headline>Cricket - Healy to stay in India despite injury.</headline>
<dateline>BANGALORE, India 1996-10-23</dateline>

<p>Injured wicketkeeper Ian Healy will stay with the Australian team in India even though Adam Gilchrist has been called in to cover for him, team officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday Australia had called on Gilchrist to join the team on their Indian tour as a stand-in for Healy.</p>
<p>Healy, who suffered a hamstring injury in Australia's two-wicket loss to India in a Titan Cup limited overs match on Monday, would remain with the squad despite an announcement by the Australian Cricket Board in Sydney he would return home.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to keep Heals here because the strain is not as bad as we thought,&quot; captain Mark Taylor said. &quot;We are getting a replacement, Gilly is coming over, but the message (that Healy is pulling out) might have been misinterpreted (by the board).&quot;</p>
<p>Healy will stay with the side to have treatment with team physiotherapist Errol Alcott and may be fit to play in the triangular tournament again next week, Taylor said.</p>
<p>Western Australia's Gilchrist was expected to reach India on Thursday.</p>
