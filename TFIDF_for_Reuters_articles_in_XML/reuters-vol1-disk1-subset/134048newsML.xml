<title>SWITZERLAND: ABB nine-month profit rises as expected.</title>
<headline>ABB nine-month profit rises as expected.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH, Switzerland</dateline>
<text>
<p>ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, one of the world's largest electrical engineering groups, on Tuesday reported a 24 percent rise in nine-month net profit, largely in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>Chief executive Percy Barnevik said he expected business to remain tough next year before showing a substantial jump in 1998.</p>
<p>But an old worry of industry analysts -- the health of its high-profile power generation business -- resurfaced as the company reduced its expectations for that segment's earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;There are little problems but nothing that should be overemphasised,&quot; said Peter Knox of Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
<p>This year and next ABB, created by the merger of Sweden's Asea AB and Switzerland's BBC Brown Boveri AG in 1988, is suffering from the effects of Western Europe's sluggish economy. But it has still been able to raise profits as it expands into the growth markets of Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997 we have to look for a more tough year with respect to demand,&quot; Barnevik, also the group's president and chairman, said.</p>
<p>But by 1998 ABB expects the current improvement in Western Europe's economy to help its business, which is cyclical.</p>
<p>ABB said its sales in the January/September period rose 3 percent to $24.08 billion.</p>
<p>Net profit rose 24 percent to $809 million, slightly above forecasts for $805 million, but ABB's shares were hit by profit-taking and pulled down by a weaker Swiss market overall to end 8 Swiss francs ($6.35) lower at 1,570 francs ($1,250).</p>
