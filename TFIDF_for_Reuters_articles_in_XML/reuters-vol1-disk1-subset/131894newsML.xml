<p>Queensland Metals Corp Ltd said on Monday its wholly-owned Queensland Magnesia (QMAG) division's A$5.5 milion expansion project remained on budget and was ahead of its April 1997 scheduled start-up date.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that operational handover will occur in early 1997,&quot; QMC managing director Creagh O'Connor said in the group's September quarter report.</p>
<p>QMC, which paid Pancontinential Mining Ltd A$63 million earlier this year for the outstanding 40 percent stake in QMAG, has embarked on expansion of the project after raising a further A$112 million in a successful share issue and a further A$81.8 million from a recent rights issue.</p>
<p>Construction of two machine electronic ore sorting plants was well advanced with installation expected next month, O'Connor said.</p>
<p>A A$20 million expansion of the dead-burn plant's third shaft kiln had also started and was expected to be operational by the second half of next year, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the project) is on schedule and on budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Negotiations had started to refinance the QMAG project debt on a basis consistent with the changed structure and outlook for the project, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that these negotiations would be completed by the end of the calendar year,&quot; O'Connor said.</p>
<p>Production output from QMAG was intentionally restrained during the September quarter, due mainly to slower activity in the market, exacerbated by the northern hemisphere summer and increased competition, O'Connor said.</p>
<p>Total ore mined fell to 666,750 tonnes from 787,395 in the corresponding quarter last year with 49,903 tonnes of beneficiated magnesite produced against 81,921 previously.</p>
<p>Total shipments of both electrofused and deadburned magnensia fell to 22,402 tonnes from 32,285 tonnes last year.  </p>
<p>The QMAG project's production is used mainly in the production of magnesia-carbon bricks used as refractory linings in steel-making furnaces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile commercial negotiations were continuing to further a joint venture programme involving a large-scale demonstration plant for the group's Magmetal project, O'Connor said.</p>
<p>A full-scale commercial plant was estimated to cost about A$680 million with output targeted mainly at a rapidly-growing lightweight auto components industry, he said.</p>
