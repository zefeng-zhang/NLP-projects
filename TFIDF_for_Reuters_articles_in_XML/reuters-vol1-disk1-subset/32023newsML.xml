<p>President Saddam Hussein visited headquarters of the Iraqi air defence command on Wednesday, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.</p>
<p>It was his second meeting on Wednesday with the air defence commanders. INA said Saddam also held a meeting with senior officers of the Iraqi missile force.</p>
<p>&quot;His excellency acquainted himself with the progress of work in our brave air defence units and gave his valuable directives on how to defend and protect our land and air space,&quot; INA said.</p>
<p>In his meeting with Iraqi missile force officers Saddam listened to detailed explanation made by some of the officers on their tasks to defend Iraqi land and air space, the agency said.</p>
<p>In his first meeting  on Wednesday, Saddam urged Iraqi air force commanders to hit back at U.S., British and French planes policing two no-fly-zones in his couuntry -- one in the north and the other in the south.</p>
<p>The INA despatch came only hours after large explosions were heard in Baghdad on Wednesday evening and heavy anti-aircraft fire lit up the night sky, witnesses said.</p>
<p>It was not known yet whether the explosions were caused by incoming U.S. bombs or by outgoing anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
<p>A U.S. defence official said U.S. forces had not provoked the anti-aircraft firing in Baghdad. &quot;It's not us,&quot; the official said. &quot;It's not precipitated by anything that U.S. forces are involved in.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States has mounted two missile strikes on Iraqi defence positions in southern Iraq since Tuesday to neutralise possible Iraqi resistance to President Bill Clinton's decision on Tuesday to extend the southern air-exclusion zone.</p>
<p>Clinton said the U.S. mission in Iraq &quot;has been achieved&quot; and Iraq has withdrawn its forces from a northern Kurdish area at least for the time being.</p>
