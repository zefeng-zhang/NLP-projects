<p>Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso voiced support for the concept of presidential re-election in Brazil but sidestepped the issue of whether he was personally seeking a second term in office, Brazilian newspapers reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>While saying Tuesday that he backed a move to amend the constitution to allow re-election, he added that this matter was separate from his own political prospects, the Gazeta Mercantial newspaper said.  </p>
<p>&quot;What Congress needs to decide is a principle. And I have never been shy to support this principle. Another issue is the reelection of the current president and if he will be or not candidate,&quot; Cardoso was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Cardoso made these comments at a news conference in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the site of the 10th presidential summit of the Rio Group of Latin American and Caribbean states.</p>
<p>Cardoso also said the government will follow the political forces' action in favor of re-election, the Folha de Sao Paulo daily said.</p>
<p>Folha also said Cardoso declined to comment on an widely-expected cabinet reshuffle after October's municipal elections.</p>
<p>Cardoso took office in January 1995 for a four-year term.</p>
