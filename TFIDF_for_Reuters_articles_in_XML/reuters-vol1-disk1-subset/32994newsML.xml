<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat held their first talk -- by telephone -- hours before they were due to meet for their first summit, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, telephoned the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the afternoon,&quot; the Israeli leader's spokesman Shai Bazak said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;During the conversation, Arafat apologised to the prime minister for the names Netanyahu was called in the Palestinian press.</p>
<p>&quot;Arafat said in the call that he was very angry when he read those newspapers and said he could not accept those things and that he had ordered an immediate investigation against those who wrote them,&quot; Bazak said.</p>
<p>A columnist in Al-Ayyam newspaper wrote on Tuesday that books written by Netanyahu showed that he was &quot;more Nazi than Hitler&quot;.</p>
<p>Bazak quoted Arafat as telling Netanyahu he had no doubt the prime minister would move the peace process forward.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister thanked him for his words and expressed satisfaction that understandings were reached for continuing the process,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Arafat's adviser, Nabil Abu Rdainah, confirmed there had been a telephone call but said the Palestinian leader had discussed with Netanyahu plans for the summit at the Israel-Gaza border.</p>
