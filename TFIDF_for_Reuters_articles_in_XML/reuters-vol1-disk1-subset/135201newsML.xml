<p>Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Tuesday after a late afternoon slide trade which brokers described as a short bout of overdue profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;This market was long overdue for a short-term correction, said Francis Wong, head of regional sales at DBS Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index shed 65.39 points to 12,444.66 after trending sideways on robust volume during the morning session.</p>
<p>Trading was active all day, bringing turnover to HK$7.30 billion, greater than Friday's HK$6.67 billion.</p>
<p>But brokers said they thought selling would be limited.  </p>
<p>Wong of DBS said the sellers in the market both those shedding long-term positions and those taking short-term trading gains.</p>
<p>&quot;While we saw some lock in profits today, locally based funds are not selling because the property market outlook is improving,&quot; said Patrick Ho, sales director at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;They will continue to hold onto their (equity market) positions if they think the property market improvements are going to flow back to the market,&quot; Ho said.</p>
<p>Technical analysts were cautious on the short-term outlook for the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;Indicators on the daily chart, the RSI and MACD have turned bearish,&quot; said Ted Chen, technical analyst at Technical Data Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term we are running into resistance at 12,600. The market is very overbought and we are likely to see limited upside for the remainder of the week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chen puts minor support at 12,300 and major support at 11,900.</p>
<p>The property sector managed to fare the best in the afternoon sell-off, while the commercial and industrial sector bore the brunt of the heaviest profit-taking.</p>
