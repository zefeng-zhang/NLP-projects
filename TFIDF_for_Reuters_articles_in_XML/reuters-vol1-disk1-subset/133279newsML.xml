<p>Vytautas Landsbergis, who spearheaded Lithuania's 1990-91 drive for independence, was headed for coalition talks on Tuesday and savouring his comeback against his ex-communist foes.</p>
<p>Landsbergis and his Homeland Union party won the most votes in a first round of parliamentary elections, unseating the former Communists of the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party in a sweet revenge for his defeat at the polls in 1992.</p>
<p>With 1,495 of the 2,037 voting districts counted, the Homeland Union had taken 29 percent of the first round vote. The former communists were third, just under 10 percent.</p>
<p>Landsbergis named Gediminas Vagnorius as candidate for prime minister, a post he occupied in 1991. They will have to assemble a coalition in the 141-seat parliament to form a government.</p>
<p>&quot;We can say that our party won a victory in the first round and we do not think that after all the votes are counted there will be any significant changes that could affect our leading position,&quot; Landsbergis said.</p>
<p>The short, stocky former music professor was the unlikely leader of the Baltic state's dramatic move to independence from the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>He gained admiration for himself and his people by standing up to Moscow, especially after 13 people were killed by Soviet troops on an attack on Vilnius television tower, protected by ordinary people behind makeshift barricades.</p>
<p>But his popularity plumetted when the economy collapsed and the independence movement was riven by faction fighting. A humiliating electoral defeat in 1992 was compounded when ex-communist Algirdas Brazauskas won the presidency in 1993.</p>
<p>The former communists conceded defeat on Monday and said they were ready to serve in opposition. &quot;The people put more hope in us than we could objectively fulfill,&quot; said speaker of parliament Cheslovas Jurshenas.</p>
<p>A turnout of just 55 percent -- compared with 1992's 75 percent -- took some of the shine from Landsbergis's win.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union is expected to ally itself with the Christian Democrats, second-placed on just over 10 percent, in a right-wing coalition. It may also invite the Centre Union, fourth at eight percent.</p>
<p>As Landsbergis prepared for talks on a coalition, President Brazauskas appealed for stability. &quot;Continuity is an imperative and the new government should continue the work of the previous government,&quot; Brazauskas, who is now without party affiliation, said on Lithuanian radio.</p>
<p>The ex-communists had regained power on promises to ease the pain of reform to a market economy. But instead of fulfilling populist pledges, they followed a path of austerity charted by the International Monetary Fund. Economic gains resulted but critics complained of corruption and croneyism.</p>
<p>The government was badly hurt in a banking crisis last year when a former prime minister withdrew his personal savings from a bank days before it shut.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see a Lithuania as different as possible from the Lithuania under Communists,&quot; Landsbergis, told reporters. &quot;The Lithuania under ex-Communists was no different from the Lithuania under Communists.&quot;</p>
<p>The first round of the vote decides 70 of the 141 seats in parliament under a proportional representation party list vote. The remaining 71 seats are decided on a majority vote and a second round run off will be held on November 10.</p>
