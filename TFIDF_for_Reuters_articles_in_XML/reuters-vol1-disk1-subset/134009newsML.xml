<p>France and Germany unveiled a long-awaited proposal on Tuesday to allow European Union countries to integrate faster if they wish and not be held up by reluctant partners such as Britain.</p>
<p>French European Affairs Minister Michel Barnier and German State Secretary Werner Hoyer said the issue, known as &quot;flexibility&quot; in EU jargon, was one of the most important facing the bloc as it rewrites its treaty to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;The system we have set up for 15 countries will certainly not work for 25 or 30,&quot; Hoyer said, referring to the planned enlargement of the EU into eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The idea is to bring into the EU treaty -- currently under review in the inter-governmental conference (IGC) -- a clause making it clear that some countries can move ahead of others in areas of European cooperation.</p>
<p>Such areas already exist -- ranging from the planned single European currency, which is in the EU treaty, to the Schengen pact on open borders, which is independent -- but the two men said enlargement was likely to mean even more.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe flexibility is going to multiply with enlargement to the East and South,&quot; Barnier said.</p>
<p>The bloc is due to bring in as many as a dozen new members early in the next century, making policy making even harder than it is now with 15 countries.</p>
<p>Although not openly targeted at any one country, the idea of flexibility is seen at least in part as a response to longstanding British reluctance to march along with continental Europe towards ever deeper political and economic integration.</p>
<p>Most EU countries, including Britain, generally favour flexibility, but many question how far it should go.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a very strong feeling that it needs to be done carefully,&quot; said Noel Dorr, Ireland's IGC negotiator, adding that the Franco-German proposal was by no means the last word.</p>
<p>One fear is that allowing countries to move ahead could damage what has already been achieved by the EU. Another is that a small group of countries would form an inner circle, setting both the rules and agenda for those outside.</p>
<p>Keen integrationists such as Belgium and the Netherlands worry about flexibility leading to the EU being run by a small group of large countries. In a similar fashion, poorer countries such as Spain and Portugal worry about rich partners going their own way.</p>
<p>In one of its more controversial provisions, the Franco-German proposal says that no one country should be allowed to stop others from moving ahead if they want. Britain and others are likely to contest this.</p>
<p>Barnier said it was better for European countries to move ahead within the framework of the European Union than to do so outside, as with Schengen, where non-participating EU countries had no say whatsoever.</p>
<p>Both Barnier and Hoyer were quick to note that their proposal guards against excluding countries which change their mind later and want to join in with the others.</p>
<p>In a related move, Barnier and Hoyer also said France and Germany favoured seeing a reduction in the number of members of the European Commission to make it more efficient in an enlarged bloc.</p>
<p>Small countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg, fearing the loss of representation in the EU executive, oppose such a move.</p>
