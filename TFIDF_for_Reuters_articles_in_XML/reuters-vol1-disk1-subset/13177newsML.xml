<p>Australian retail giant Coles Myer Ltd has not revived plans to break up into constituent units, chairman Nobby Clark said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me say now that the board is not considering any proposals such as that at this time,&quot; Clark said in a television interview when asked if the idea of splitting the group up had resurfaced.</p>
<p>&quot;It remains one group, all of our strategic initiatives at the moment are predicated upon the group remaining whole,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Under former executive chairman and now vice chairman, businessman Solomon Lew, the group last year proposed it be split into separate listed operating groups but the decision was reversed early this year.</p>
<p>Clark also denied that Coles was seeking a replacement for chief executive Peter Bartels.</p>
<p>&quot;That's rubbish,&quot; he said and declined to comment further on any possible management changes beyond saying: &quot;What we have ... is a management team working at addressing issues and I think that's where we should leave it.&quot;  </p>
<p>Clark said Coles Myer was taking longer than it had hoped in reviewing the loss-making World 4 Kids toys chain but was almost at a stage where it would make a definitive statement.</p>
<p>He also said that the group planned more rationalisation and that its Kmart division still had problems.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Kmart is probably a year, 18 months away before we'll get on top of the problems there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When asked if the A$12 million settlement for the so-called Yannon transaction that cost Coles A$18 million was good enough, Clark replied: &quot;What we've done is achieve a very good outcome for the company.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;It's one that the board believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the settlement avoided litigation that could have cost A$4 to A$5 million and could have been two or three years in court to the distraction of the management and the board.</p>
<p>The settlement was announced on Friday.</p>
<p>The once-secret 1990 share transaction involving private company Yannon Pty Ltd cost Coles A$18 million and benefitted a company associated with Lew.</p>
