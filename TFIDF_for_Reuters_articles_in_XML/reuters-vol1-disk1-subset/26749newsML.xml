<p>Andre Agassi and Thomas Muster, on opposite sides of the U.S. Open seeding controversy, will get to settle their differences on the tennis court after each scored four-set, fourth round victories on Monday.</p>
<p>The sixth-seeded Agassi, who felt he deserved his promotion from his ranking of eight, played just well enough to get past fellow American David Wheaton.</p>
<p>Agassi rallied from a set down to score a 4-6 6-2 6-3 6-4 victory that set up a quarter-final clash with second-ranked Austrian clay court king Muster.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got to prove youself day after day. It doesn't matter what your ranking is,&quot; said Agassi, who won the 1994 Open as an unseeded player, said of his Grand Slam philosophy.</p>
<p>Muster, who complained about favouritism toward Agassi after his own demotion to third seed, overcame a strength-sapping stomach virus to hold off 13th-seeded Swede Thomas Enqvist 7-6 6-2 4-6 6-1 in the only fourth-round matchup of seeded players.</p>
<p>Agassi was broken at love in the seventh game and it cost him the first set. He didn't make that mistake again, never giving Wheaton another break point.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he played very steady the whole match,&quot; said Wheaton, the lowest-ranked player to reach the fourth round at 131 in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically he just waited for me to miss a lot of balls, like I did,&quot; added the one-time Wimbledon semifinalist.</p>
<p>Enqvist got off to a fast start but squandered his golden opportunity to take the opening set from the Austrian while serving at 5-3.</p>
<p>&quot;The first set was very important,&quot; said Enqvist, a quarter-finalist at this year's Australian Open.</p>
<p>&quot;I had 5-3 and a set point. In that game I had three double faults. Against the number two player in the world, you can't do that,&quot; added Enqvist, who then dropped the tie-break 7-4.</p>
<p>Both players had trouble holding serve over the first three sets with each being broken seven times.</p>
<p>But when Enqvist extended the match by taking the third set, Muster made it clear there would be no fifth.</p>
<p>Though drained by the heat and a shaky stomach, a determined Muster raced through the fourth set. The Austrian lost just 12 points in the set and only two off his serve, serving notice that Agassi had better be ready when they square off.</p>
<p>&quot;We're both going to be beating the ball pretty good from the baseline,&quot; promised Agassi.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll hear explosions off the racket four, five, six times a point. That's big tennis.&quot;  </p>
<p>The other men's quarter-final berth up for grabs on the Labour Day holiday programme was claimed by 67th-ranked Spaniard Javier Sanchez, who surprised 20th-ranked Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch 6-4 7-6 7-6.</p>
<p>Sanchez, who had lost in the first round of eight of his previous nine Grand Slams, reached the quarters here for the second time in 10 U.S. Open campaigns.</p>
<p>As if it were not surprising enough to find Sanchez alive and well into the second week at a major, there is not an oddsmaker on the planet who would have predicted he would last longer than his famous sister, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. But that was just what happened.</p>
<p>The third-seeded Sanchez, who won the Open in 1994, got a look at the future of women's tennis as she fell to 16th-seeded rising star Martina Hingis of Switzerland 6-1 3-6 6-4.</p>
<p>In the quarter-finals, the 15-year-old Hingis will face another battle-tested veteran in seventh-seeded Czech Jana Novotna, who clobbered 17th seed Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 6-2 6-0 in just 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Top seed and defending champion Steffi Graf was not about to give way to the youth movement, however.</p>
<p>The German superstar ended the exciting run of 15-year-old Russian up-and-comer Anna Kournikova 6-2 6-1 to reach the Open quarter-finals for the 12th consecutive year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important to have these new faces come up,&quot; the four-time champion said of Hingis and Kournikova.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to know the future of women's tennis is going to show up.&quot;</p>
<p>In the present, however, Graf will continue her run at a 21st Grand Slam singles title with a quarter-final against Austrian Judith Wiesner, a 6-0 6-3 winner over Italian Rita Grande.</p>
<p>Wiesner has won a total of two sets from Graf in nine previous defeats.</p>
