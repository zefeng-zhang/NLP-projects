<p>Europe's competition commissioner Karel van Miert said on Thursday he was monitoring a television rights deal between BSkyB and the English premier league but has not called for a formal investigation.</p>
<p>A statement was issued clarifying Van Miert's position after the BBC put out a press release saying Van Miert had called for a probe in an interview with BBC radio.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Van Miert) wants to point out that a distinction has to be made between the need to closely watch all such deals and formal investigations,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a formal investigation is presently underway as to the Dutch sports channel, especially as regards the seven-year duration of the contract and not as far as the BSkyB-Premier League is concerned,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>In August the European Commission launched a probe into a plan by the Dutch soccer association KNVB to give a new TV channel called Sport 7, which it partly owns, exclusive rights for seven years over premier and first division matches.</p>
<p>BSkyB sealed a 670 million pound ($1.07 billion) contract in June this year to buy the rights to transmit premier league matches live until 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;As to the BSkyB-Premiership contract, Van Miert said that this is part of a more general monitoring exercise related to the overall phenomnenon of exclusive TV rights on sports events,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>In an interview broadcast on BBC radio on Thursday night, Van Miert said: &quot;We have to look into the (BSkyB-Premiership) deal and also the duration of the contract.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked by the programme if he would intervene in the deal he replied, &quot;We certainly will. We certainly will. And what should not happen is that those acquiring the rights will be in such a dominant position that they are going to impose the rules.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month Van Miert signalled his concern over long-term deals involving ever-larger sums of money in submissions to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;There is this trend which seriously worries us that increasingly a few large groups can buy such (sports broadcasting) rights,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BSkyB issued a statement criticing the BBC press release based on the interview, calling it a &quot;blatant distortion of the facts&quot;.</p>
