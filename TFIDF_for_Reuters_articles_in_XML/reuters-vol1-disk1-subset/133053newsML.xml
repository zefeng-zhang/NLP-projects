<p>South African mercenaries working for private security firm Executive Outcomes have deployed at a hydo-electric dam under construction in northern Sierra Leone after a weekend attack by rebels, officials said.</p>
<p>The government ordered security at the Bumbuna dam be put in the hands of Executive Outcomes at the insistence of Italian construction company Salcost, military officials and power and energy ministry officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Salcost had evacuated its staff to the capital Freetown and had threatened to pull out of the contract, energy ministry officials said.</p>
<p>The dam, due to start generating in 1998 although initially due to export to neighbour Guinea as well, was the target of a weekend attack by rebels who temporarily overran government soldiers guarding it. More than 20 people died in the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The military high command in Freetown has received intelligence reports that RUF (Revolutionary United Front) rebels are again massing about 15 miles from the dam for another attempt to caputre it,&quot; one military official said.</p>
<p>The civilian government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the rebels, who took up arms in 1991, agreed in April to extend an existing ceasefire. The rebels and the army, which restored civilian rule after four years in March, had agreed a truce.</p>
<p>Peace talks have stalled, in part over rebel opposition to the presence of the South Africans, who also guard the diamond centre of Koidu and the currently idle titanium dioxide or rutile mine, in the past another key foreign exchange earner.</p>
<p>A string of attacks blamed on rebels has put the truce under strain but neither side has spoken of abandoning it.</p>
