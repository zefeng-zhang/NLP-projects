<p>Polish shares fell in higher turnover on Monday extending their slide from October 9 record of 15,078.7 points but analysts expected a rebound in the next few sessions on the strength of the market's long-term uptrend.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index fell 2.3 percent to 14,380.3, and turnover rose 6.6 percent to 97.9 million zlotys ($35 million) on both markets as 61 issues fell, 13 rose and six were flat.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the uptrend is so strong that it's not so easy to stop it. I don't think we will quickly have a sharp jump but the market shouldn't fall below 14,000,&quot; said Artur Nagorka, a trader of Wood and Company.</p>
<p>Analysts said the current fall was in large part due to attractive public offerings on the primary market such as Bank Ochrony Srodowiska (BOS), drawing some capital from the bourse, but said the macro-economic signals remained positive.</p>
<p>Early this month London's Nomura Research said in a report the Warsaw bourse was vulnerable to profit-taking by international investors after the market's over 90-percent rise since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>But some analysts said that even if such concerted profit-taking materialised, the WIG index would likely fall no more than 10 percent and could recover, climbing to 15,500-16,000 points in late November or early December.</p>
<p>They said industrial boilermaker Rafako, Monday's biggest loser, fell 9.8 percent to 17.5 zlotys ($6.3), after showing a net loss of 1.73 million zlotys ($0.6 million) in September.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units fell two percent in a 18.9-million-zloty turnover ($6.8 million) in regular session and rose 0.7 percent in 21.1-million-zloty ($7.5 million) continuous trade.</p>
