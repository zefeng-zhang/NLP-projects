<p>House and Senate Republican leaders said Wednesday they had decided not to press for passage of a tax cut before the November elections and would instead press ahead on domestic spending cuts.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters after meeting with top Republicans from both chambers that they agreed there was no point in passing a tax cut just to see it vetoed by President Clinton.  </p>
<p>Some Republicans had hoped passage of a tax cut by their party would boost their chances of retaining control of the House and Senate and would help Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole. The cornerstone of Dole's campaign policy on economics is an income tax cut of 15 percent (corrects to make clear the proposal is for a 15 percent tax cut).</p>
<p>&quot;If we were to pass a real tax cut, Bill Clinton would veto it,&quot; Gingrich told reporters. &quot;That's right,&quot; Lott added.</p>
<p>The Republicans agreed their goal would be to pass and send to the president for signature as many of the 13 annual spending bills as can be done by the end of September. Those federal programs for which spending has not been cleared by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year will be covered by funding included in a catch-all spending measure called a &quot;continuing resolution.&quot;</p>
<p>However, major disagreements remain over spending with Clinton seeking higher funds for many domestic programs and about $10 billion less than approved by Congress for the military.</p>
