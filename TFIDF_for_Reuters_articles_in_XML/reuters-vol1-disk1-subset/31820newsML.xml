<p>Chile's total investment rate should reach 28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, interim Central Bank President Jorge Marshall said.</p>
<p>The rate, which measures gross investment, will be &quot;one of the highest rates in the past decade and only slightly lower than that expected for the present year,&quot; Marshall told Congress in his speech giving 1997 economic projections.</p>
<p>The forecast was part of a generally positive outlook for the Chilean internal economy next year, with inflation forecast at 5.5 percent and growth at 5.5 to 6.0 percent, both also below this year's levels, said Marshall.  </p>
<p>The rise in internal spending rates should be slightly less than one percentage point under GDP growth, he said.</p>
<p>Monetary policies seek &quot;to encourage a more moderate pace in GDP and spending growth, in order to bring their levels to a course that is coherent with a medium and long-term equilibrium,&quot; said Marshall, a Harvard-educated economist who became interim bank chief when president Roberto Zahler resigned in June.</p>
