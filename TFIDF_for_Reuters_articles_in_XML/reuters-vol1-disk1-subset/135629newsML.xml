<p>Advertising expenditure is growing rapidly in India, where companies are using an increasing number of new cable and satellite channels to reach the world's second biggest television audience.</p>
<p>Zenith Media said in a report on Tuesday that only 31 percent of all households among India's 884 million people had televisions, but that still made India the second biggest potential television market after China.</p>
<p>It said advertising expenditure was expanding faster than India's general 6.0 percent economic growth.</p>
<p>Total &quot;adspend&quot; grew by 21 percent last year, with television accounting for 29 percent of the total, Zenith said in its report &quot;Television in Asia Pacific to 2001&quot;.</p>
<p>Television adspend grew by 10 percent to $367 million last year and was expected to grow by a yearly 12 to 15 percent until it reached $766 million in 2001, at current 1995 prices, Zenith said.</p>
<p>&quot;As electricity reaches more remote areas television audiences are expected to rise by 10 to 15 percent a year, as is constant-price television adspend,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said India's present advertising boom was mostly benefitting Doordarshan, the state-run broadcaster which has a terrestrial broadcasting monopoly and takes the vast majority of advertising.</p>
<p>But with the arrival of satellite broadcasting in 1992, Doordarshan has had to fight to retain its share of viewing and ad expenditure in the face of competition from foreign and domestic multichannel service providers.</p>
<p>Zenith said the top five advertisers in India were HLL, Colgate Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble, BPL and Philips.</p>
