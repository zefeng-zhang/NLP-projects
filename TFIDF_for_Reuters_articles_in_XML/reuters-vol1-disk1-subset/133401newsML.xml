<p>A deteriorating trade balance and the government's inability to narrow the budget deficit have cast a shadow over the growth outlook for the Brazilian economy in 1997, tge financial daily Gazeta Mercantil reported.</p>
<p>In a front-page story citing local analysts, Gazeta said the Brazilian economy -- which is expected to grow between 2.5 and 3 percent this year -- was unlikely to expand more than 4 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the 1997 trade balance should post a deficit of between $5 to $6 billion, well above the $3.5 billion forecast for 1996.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile next year's public sector operational deficit should not improve significantly vis-a-vis 1996, which government officials are reluctantly admitting will be of around 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product. The operational deficit is the shortfall between expenditures and revenues excluding capital items.</p>
<p>Gazeta said inflation would be the government's only positive indicator with 1997 wholesale prices increasing around 6 percent and consumer prices rising on the order of 8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be that the Real Plan's logic calls for restricted growth,&quot; said Sao Paulo University professor Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca who forecast a 1997 growth rate of 2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The Brazilian economy will not be taking off in 1997,&quot; former Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega was quoted as saying. Da Nobrega forecast a growth rate of between 3 to 4 percent in 1997.</p>
