<p>About 40 inmates were burned alive early on Tuesday after a fire apparently caused by prison guards broke out in a Venezuelan jail, officials and human rights activists said.</p>
<p>&quot;The version that the prisoners are telling me is that about 40 were burned to death,&quot; human rights activist Olimpia Hung told reporters outside the La Planta jail on the southwestern outskirts of the capital.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Henrique Meier agreed the number of deaths could be as high as 40. &quot;Yes, it could be,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The fire started when national guardsmen closed off a wing of the prison and threw in tear gas canisters. Meier said it was unclear why the guards locked up the prisoners and said an investigation would be launched into the cause of the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to be studied. But it wouldn't make sense for the prisoners to start the fire themselves unless they wanted to commit suicide,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One prisoner who called Radio Caracas Radio from inside the jail said the bodies were fused together, showing that the inmates had clung to one other as they waited to die. More than five hours after the fire was brought under control no bodies had been removed and national guardsman blocked the jail's main entrance.</p>
<p>Female inmates housed in a nearby wing shouted through the bars: &quot;They're killing the prisoners.&quot; Other prisoners held signs demanding that families and journalists be allowed in.</p>
<p>Radio and television reports said national guardsmen had also opened fire on the prisoners and Hung said one body showed signs of bullet wounds.</p>
<p>Venezuela's overcrowded and decaying prisons are frequent scenes of violence between inmates and clashes with guards.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the problems in our prisons, apart from the overcrowding, is the excessively hostile treatment by some guards,&quot; Meier said.</p>
<p>The tragedy at La Planta would be the worst in Venezuela's jails since about 120 prisoners were burned or hacked to death with machetes during a gang fight at the Sabaneta jail in the western city of Maracaibo in January 1994.</p>
<p>La Planta was built for 300 prisoners but currently holds about 900.</p>
