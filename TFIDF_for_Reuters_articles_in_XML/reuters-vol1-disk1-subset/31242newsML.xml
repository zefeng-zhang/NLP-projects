<p>Mexican army and police launched an intensive search in the mountains in the state of Guerrero on Tuesday for a group of hooded, armed men believed to be members of a guerrilla group, the government said.</p>
<p>Television news reports showed army helicopters firing into heavily wooded areas in the search for the presumed guerrillas.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry said in a report that a taxi driver saw 10 hooded, armed men crossing a highway, which sparked the widespread search by the army and police.</p>
<p>The hooded men were believed to belong to the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), whose attacks killed at least 15 people in several states last week.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry said that by nightfall all it had found were two hoods and a pair of military boots.</p>
<p>Thousands of troops and federal police have already been drafted into rural states such as Guerrero and Oaxaca where the EPR struck.</p>
<p>A senior government source said on Tuesday that the rebel group would be hard to defeat because of their high mobility,</p>
<p>Police also remained on alert in the capital, Mexico City.</p>
<p>In the state of Oaxaca, the state government presented three men who it says had ties to the rebel group.</p>
<p>State-run news agency Notimex quoted a federal Interior Ministry statement that four presumed members of the EPR were being held in the state of Oaxaca.</p>
