<title>SWITZERLAND: CS recommends overweighting Georg Fischer.</title>

<p>CS Research said it was recommending overweighting Swiss engineering group Georg Fischer AG in a model portfolio, but also said it was lowering its earnings estimates.</p>
<p>&quot;In the second half of the current year operating performance should improve significantly, but it will be difficult to make up for the disappointing performance in the first half,&quot; CS Research said in a recent study.</p>
<p>Georg Fischer reported on August 29 that its group net in the first half fell to 20 million Swiss francs from 35 million in the comparable 1995 period.</p>
<p>CS Research analyst Andrea Snider said CS had reduced its earnings per share estimates for 1996 and 1997 by about 20 percent to 90 Swiss francs, and 115 Swiss francs, respectively.</p>
<p>But CS Research noted that Georg Fischer's manufacturing technology division, including Charmilles, and piping systems divisions continued to be &quot;on a profitable growth path.&quot;</p>
<p>It added that interim results reflected start-up costs and &quot;inefficient management of changes&quot; in manufacturing processes at the concern's automotive products group.</p>
<p>Georg Fischer said in July it was acquiring a majority stake in Swiss electro-erosion machinery maker AGIE Holding AG.</p>
<p>The company plans to consolidate its Charmilles Technologies unit with AGIE. The merger is expected to receive the approval of U.S. anti-trust authorities in the next few weeks, CS Research said.</p>
<p>CS Research also said that Fischer had an attractive portfolio of assets, with potential to earn excess returns. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340</p>
