<p>U.S. Midcontinent unleaded gasoline differentials were steady Wednesday following a report that gasoline stocks in the region were drawn down last week, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline inventories at PADD II Midwest refineries stood at 49.77 million barrels for the week ended August 30, down 2.98 million barrels from the prior week and 3.76 million barrels from the same week last year, according to American Petroleum Institute.</p>
<p>The draw countered perceptions of plentiful stocks in the region and could generate some bullish sentiment, traders said.  </p>
<p>Distillate stocks last week stood at 29.71 million barrels, nearly 1.13 million barrels above the prior week but still 1.43 million barrels below the same week last year.</p>
<p>Refineries in the region were operating at 97.2 percent of capacity, virtually unchanged from the prior week on crude runs of 6.65 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>Chicago prompt unleaded was unchanged at 0.75 cent under the print, with later deliveries 1.25 cents under the print and premium 2.75 cents higher.</p>
<p>Group Three prompt unleaded remained 1.0/1.25 cent a gallon over the print with later deliveries 0.25 cent under to even with the print and premium 2.25 cents higher.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel was steady in both markets, and high sulphur unchanged despite the build in distillate stocks in the region, which did not reflect a delayed diesel shipment on the Williams pipeline system.</p>
<p>Jet/kero was unchanged in Chicago and Group Three.</p>
