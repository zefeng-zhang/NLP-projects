<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistani protesters stone U.S. consulate.</title>
<headline>Pakistani protesters stone U.S. consulate.</headline>
<dateline>LAHORE, Pakistan 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>Student followers of a right-wing Pakistani political party attacked the United States consulate in Lahore on Wednesday night with stones to protest against U.S. missile strikes against Iraq, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Guards at the consulate in central Lahore, capital of the central province of Punjab, fired a few shots in the air before about 100 members of the Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba group, the student arm of the Jamaat-i-Islami party, dispersed.</p>
<p>There was no immediate report of injuries.</p>
<p>Police said they had registered a complaint from the consulate about the attack, in which the witnesses said glass at a guard room was smashed by stoning.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Pakistan expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; over the latest U.S. missile strike against Iraq and said it was opposed to the use of force to settle differences.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Minister of State Nazir Sultan, in a speech to parliament, appealed to countries concerned to exercise &quot;the highest degree of restraint, scrupulously adhere to the U.N. Charter and Security Council resolutions dealing with Iraq&quot;.</p>
<p>It was Pakistan's second statement of concern since the United States launched its first missile strike against Iraq on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Islamic Pakistan, which has been trying to improve its previously strained relations with the United States, sent troops to Saudi Arabia to join the allied coalition against Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis though popular opinion at home at the time strongly favoured Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Islamabad has since sent food and other humanitarian assistance to Iraq to alleviate the impact of U.N. sanctions.</p>
