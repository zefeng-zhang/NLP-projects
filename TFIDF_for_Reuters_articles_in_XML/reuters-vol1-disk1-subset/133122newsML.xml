<p>President Boris Yeltsin, preparing for heart surgery late next month, discussed a new initiative to consolidate Russia's power structures at a meeting on Tuesday with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted the presidential press service as saying the main topic of the talks in the Barvikha sanatorium near Moscow was a proposal by Yeltsin to establish a &quot;permanent four&quot; group of top officials to coordinate decision-making.</p>
<p>The four -- Chernomyrdin, Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais and the heads of the two chambers of parliament -- are expected to formulate key policies during the three months or so when Yeltsin's condition is expected to restrict his activity.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, who is Yeltsin's constitutional stand-in, said that there would be no change in the course of Russia's economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to move away from the main political line which we are following, impossible, impermissible and unacceptable under any circumstances,&quot; he told a meeting of a new tax commission later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said the government's programme aimed to create conditions for economic growth.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press service said a wide range of economic, social and political issues were raised during the talks at Barvikha, including the draft 1997 budget which the lower house of parliament rejected last week on a first reading.</p>
<p>The two men examined problems in financing the army, where salaries have not been paid for months, and far northern regions which depend on budget funds to get through the harsh winter.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, urged the government to meet its debts to the army as soon as possible.</p>
