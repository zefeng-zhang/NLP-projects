<p>Morocco's second largest private conglomerate Ste Nationale d'Investissement, posted consolidated net profits of $43.7 million in 1995, a firm spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;SNI posted a consolidated net profit of 378 million dirhams ($43.7 million) in 1995. It also registred a turnover of 3.8 billion dirhams in the same period in which agro-industry sector held a stake of 37 percent,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The decision to relase the results was taken after a meeting of the board of directors, he said. </p>
<p>&quot;It is the first time that the conglomerate published a consolidated results, which were audited by Price Waterhouse experts in Morocco and France,&quot; a market analyst said.</p>
<p>The group gave no comparative figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The management team aims at achieving a strategic consolidation of the company's portfolio on the most profitable business with careful consideration to synergy around the core activity of the holding,&quot; Mohamed Mekouar, analyst at the Casablanca-based Upline Securities stockbroker said.</p>
<p>The portfolio will be concentrated of the food industry, cement construction business and the finance sector, he said. </p>
<p>Mekouar said in this prospect, the conglomerate has recently ceded its 30 percent in Renault Industrie Maroc a car accessory firm. The move aimed at avoiding risks related to the dependence on one sole client and one sole supplier.</p>
<p>The client and supplier is the leading French-Moroccan company Renault Maroc.</p>
<p>Last year, SNI increased its paid-up capital to 495 million dirhams from 385 million dirhams through a bond issue. In 1996, it brought it capita to 990 million dirhams by the increase of the share nominal value to 100 dirhams from 50 dirhams, Upline securities said. </p>
<p>The conglomerate's long term debt was 1.08 billion dirhams in 1995, it said.</p>
<p>Upline Securities said the conglomerate created Lafarge Maroc, a jointly held group with French giant Lafarge &quot;therefore creating the first Moroccan cement group both in sales and production capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>As of September 30, 1996, the estimated market value of all holdings is around 5.38 billion, indicating a value of 543.8 dirhams on a per share basis, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We forecast an average increase of 20 percent consolidated net profit to 453.6 million dirhams in 1996,&quot; Mekouar added.</p>
<p>The conglomerate's profitable listed companies are credit firm Eqdom, edible oil firm Leusieur, sugar company Cosumar, cement firm Ciments Artificiels de Meknes, and brewery Brasserie du Maroc (Corrects to add Brasserie du Maroc.)</p>
<p>One of the 46 listed stocks on the Casablanca bourse, SNI has a market capitalisation of 5.8 billion dirhams and was last traded at 560 dirhams (Corrects from 56 dirhams.)</p>
<p>SNI holding was established in Casablanca in 1966 and has diversified stakes in more than 40 firms, including insurance, mining and chemical industry sectors.</p>
