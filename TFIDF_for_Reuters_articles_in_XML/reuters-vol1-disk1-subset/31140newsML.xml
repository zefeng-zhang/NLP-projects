<headline>OIL MARKETS - Rally capped after hitting post-Gulf War highs - Sept 3.</headline>

<p>Oil prices briefly hit post-Gulf War highs on Tuesday after the United States launched missiles against Iraqi defence targets in retaliation for military incursions into the Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>October futures for international benchmark Brent blend shot to $23.50 a barrel in Singapore, the highest oil price since shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait six years ago.</p>
<p>But Brent later came back to earth as it became clear there was no threat to Middle East oil supplies outside the loss of imminent Iraqi sales under a U.N. exchange for food.</p>
<p>Brent closed in London at $22.20 a barrel, up 22 cents, after gains of $1.21 on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The fear is that Middle Eastern supplies might be disrupted (but) oil supply is not at significant risk at present,&quot; brokerage Gerald and National Inter Commodities said.</p>
<p>Oil traders had been expecting Iraq in the next few weeks to make its first oil sale on world markets since Gulf War sanctions were imposed six years ago.</p>
<p>But an oil-for-food deal signed in May was suspended by the United Nations on Sunday because of fears for the safety of U.N. aid distribution monitors in Iraq.</p>
<p>The pact would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of crude over six months, about 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) at current prices, to purchase humanitarian aid for its people.</p>
<p>But Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's latest military adventure had probably derailed the plans for the resumption of Iraqi oil exports beyond the end of the year, oil analysts said.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy to the United Nations Edward Gnehm said the terms of the oil-for-food pact now must be reopened. The eventual timing of Iraqi exports would depend on Baghdad, but could take &quot;months and months&quot;, Gnhem said.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said it would be &quot;some time&quot; before Iraqi exports could be considered again.</p>
<p>&quot;This could delay the oil sale indefinitely because the U.N. can argue they cannot guarantee the safety of the food distributors,&quot; said Swiss bank UBS energy analyst Geoff Pyne.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps Saddam thought he had nothing to gain by the oil sale so he took a gamble,&quot; said Pyne.</p>
<p>&quot;Iraqi oil is not on the agenda until after the U.S. election (in November),&quot; analyst Charles Gray at London brokerage Prudential Bache said.</p>
<p>U.S. defence officials said cruise missiles were fired at military and communications targets in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Washington extended a &quot;no-fly zone&quot; over safe havens in northern and southern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going through a Gulf War instant replay,&quot; Prudential Bache's Gray said.</p>
<p>Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Baghdad would complete a withdrawal of troops from Kurdistan later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Saddam declared Western safe havens in Iraq null and void and told his forces to fight back.</p>
<p>Delays to the oil sale came when crude, at $20 for Brent, was already $4 in advance of the same time last year, helped by Middle East tensions and low inventories in the West.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not just missiles that are propelling this market higher, it's panic buying on (petroleum) products,&quot; Prudential Bache's Gray said. &quot;Those people who thought they would be bailed out by Iraqi oil are now having to rethink things.&quot;</p>
<p>Tensions in the region were already high after a truck bomb in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans at a military complex in June. Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, said to have influenced the Saudi nationals who carried out the attack, called last week for a holy war against U.S. troops in the region.</p>
