<p>Czech shares were mixed on the Prague Stock Exchange on Wednesday as the PX50 index closed unchanged at its year-high of 571.6.</p>
<p>Banking stocks Komercni Banka and Ceska Sporitelna both dipped 10 crowns, but the losses were offset by strong gains to several broader issues.</p>
<p>Overall on the market, advancers led decliners by 186 to 141, with 73 issues holding steady. Total volume was heavy at 1.1 million shares on turnover of 583.97.</p>
<p>Glass fibre maker Vertex and Elektrarny Opatovice both gained more than 200 crowns, while fat processor Setuza firmed 97 crowns to 2,044.</p>
<p>For Vertex, it was the second consecutive gain of 200 crowns or more, after experiencing a major correction over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Vertex has gained some 5,000 crowns in July, the result of a takeover battle between two investment funds, to peak at 7,204 before the correction which saw it fall below 5,000.</p>
