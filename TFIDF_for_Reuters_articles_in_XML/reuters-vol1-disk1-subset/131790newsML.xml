<p>Only a year ago, Ford Motor Corp's British chief Ian McAllister was confident enough of the benefits of European economic and monetary union (EMU) to extol its economic advantages to a television interviewer.</p>
<p>Yet with the planned start of the single currency just 26 months away, Ford is more reluctant to promote its views on EMU -- exemplifying the caution of many top firms towards one of Europe's biggest financial upheavals this century.</p>
<p>&quot;Ford is in a process of evaluating the implications (of EMU) and is not coming out one way or another,&quot; said a spokesman for the auto giant whose integrated production and sales operation spans the continent.</p>
<p>Ford is not alone in taking a non-committal line.</p>
<p>At Unilever Plc, one of Europe's biggest food and household products groups, spokesman Stephen Milton said: &quot;We have a study group that is looking at how it will affect the business and which is yet to put its recommendations forward.</p>
<p>&quot;In general Unilever is a very pro-European company and pro the single currency,&quot; Milton said, &quot;but how it will affect us we have yet to finalise.&quot;</p>
<p>Not that companies are actively antagonistic to EMU -- a revolution in Europe's finances that will allow products to be sold across frontiers without exchange risks and promises to create a wider zone of interest rate and price stability.</p>
<p>Although not all 15 members of the European Union will initially sign up for EMU, the single currency may ultimately include the whole trading block with its 356-million people and the equivalent of a $7.4 trillion gross domestic product.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, companies would gain from EMU by avoiding the cost of exchanging currencies when moving goods within the EMU zone.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank economist Josef Auer estimated in a recent research paper that German firms alone would save some 40 billion marks annually in such transaction costs.</p>
<p>Yet there are risks too -- reflected particularly in the political debate in Britain -- that imposing the monetary discipline of Germany across other countries will prove an uncomfortable straightjacket for other economies.</p>
<p>&quot;It could conceivably affect our operations in some countries,&quot; the Ford spokesman said.</p>
<p>It is in Britain that such concerns are most public.</p>
<p>Polled last November on their views towards EMU, some 30 percent of members of the Confederation of British Industry said EMU would not be beneficial and could even be harmful to their interests.</p>
<p>This was less than the 49 percent who felt a single currency would be beneficial, but was a substantial minority nonetheless.</p>
<p>Memories of Britain's 23-month struggle with recession while the pound was in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) may be one reason why some firms are still queasy at the thought of an outside body exercising financial authority.</p>
<p>Companies in Germany and France, which form the hard core of the impetus towards monetary union, are more unambiguously enthusiastic -- perhaps reflecting that they have more to gain, initially.</p>
<p>For major German and French corporations, EMU offers an end to the devaluation of weaker currencies that has made imported products such as cars more competitive than domestic offerings.</p>
<p>In contrast it was Britain's ejection from the ERM that kickstarted British economic recovery. The man who was then Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, later confessed to singing in his bath in celebration after the event.</p>
<p>Mercedes -- the luxury carmaker unit of Daimler-Benz -- exemplifies the outlook of many of the country's major industrial groups.</p>
<p>&quot;German business finds it unacceptable that hard-won productivity gains simply disappear abroad due to currency fluctuations,&quot; said Mercedes chief executive Helmut Werner.</p>
<p>He said there was no doubt the euro single currency would come and urged European industry to do its homework and make sure it was ready for currency union.</p>
<p>For many companies in the EMU bloc it is the detailed process of preparing for and converting to the single currency which is the priority issue as the 1999 start date looms.</p>
<p>Mercedes' Werner for instance estimated switching the books would cost Mercedes about 100 million marks ($64.83 million), while the Dutch central bank estimated that conversion to the euro will cost Dutch companies roughly 7.5 billion guilders ($4.34 billion). Stephan Schuster, head of Deutsche Bank's fundamental issues group, told a London conference last month that companies should hasten preparations in areas such as treasury management, banking and IT systems -- all of which are likely to become more centralised under EMU.</p>
<p>The same conference heard Deutsche's chief economist Steven Bell said time was running out fast for companies which had not yet begun their EMU planning.</p>
<p>&quot;If we have scared the living daylights out of you,&quot; Bell said, &quot;then maybe that will help.&quot;</p>
