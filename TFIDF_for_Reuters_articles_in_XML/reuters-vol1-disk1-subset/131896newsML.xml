<p>Negotiating teams from the conservative National Party and nationalist New Zealand First began their first meeting on Monday to hammer out an agenda and procedure for coalition-building talks.</p>
<p>The venue for the meeting, in parliament's library building, was not released in advance, but New Zealand First leader Winston Peters denied there was any secrecy surrounding it.</p>
<p>&quot;We will beginning discussions on matters of process before we get down to substantive matters and that will involve issues like agenda...&quot; Peters said.  </p>
<p>He said the meeting would take as long as was needed to conclude those matters.</p>
<p>New Zealand First, which holds the balance of power after on inconclusive general election on October 12, will open negotiations with the main opposition Labour Party on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have signalled to both Labour and National we are interested in conducting the negotiations fairly without favouring either side,&quot; Peters said.</p>
<p>He predicted the meeting would &quot;go very well&quot; and reiterated his election-night appeal to the media for patience.  </p>
<p>Prime Minister Jim Bolger, who is leading National's team, said the meeting was &quot;the beginning&quot;.</p>
