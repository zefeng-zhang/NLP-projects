<headline>FOCUS-European bourses follow Wall Street retreat.</headline>

<p>European stocks faded on Tuesday as investors took profits on both sides of the Atlantic and Wall Street came under additional pressure from weak bonds and a sell-off of high technology stocks.</p>
<p>Wall Street's Dow industrial average fell around 0.3 percent in morning trade after breaking its record-breaking run on Monday.</p>
<p>The London, Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges spent the whole day in negative territory, with Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index slipping well down from Monday's record close.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchanges the dollar clung on to gains made against the yen and held up against the mark despite continued demand for the German currency.</p>
<p>&quot;This firming mark is in response to international demand for the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom,&quot; said Craig Shute, fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns. &quot;International investors interested in Telekom are buying marks but the dollar weakness, or mark strength, is not seen going too far.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1645 GMT the dollar was quoted at 1.5345 marks and 112.37 yen, compared with Monday's London close of 1.5357 marks and 112.72 yen.</p>
<p>Europe's equity markets took their lead from Wall Street, with the Dow showing dropping around 15 points by the time European markets closed.</p>
<p>Traders in New York blamed a soft bond market and a general sell-off of high technology stocks for the Dow's decline.</p>
<p>Profit-taking, weaker stock index futures and Wall Street's cautious start put the brakes on London investor enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The blue chip FTSE 100 share index, which on Monday touched a record 4,073.2 points, ended at 4,057.2 for a loss of 15.9 points. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than two to one with 623 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Investors poured funds into cable stocks following news of the merger of Cable &amp; Wireless's British operations with Nynex CableComms and Bell Cablemedia to create Britain's largest cable operator.</p>
<p>But British Telecom and BSkyB, considered at risk from the deal, dropped 4-1/2 pence to 353-1/2 and 18 pence to 678-1/2 respectively.</p>
<p>German shares closed bourse trade lower, weighed down by the dollar and losses on Wall Street and in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade down 10.05 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,718.98. In computerised trade the IBIS DAX index fell 11.93 points to 2,721.74.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the index to consolidate for the rest of the week, although it was well-supported above 2,700.</p>
<p>&quot;We're dependent on the trend in the U.S., now that we've had the M3 figures and business confidence data,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;We're not seeing a consolidation where we drop down far, rather we're staying at the same levels.&quot;</p>
<p>French stocks ended a little weaker on limited consolidation that saw the shares of magazines-to-missiles group Lagardere swing wildly after the euphoric reaction to its planned takeover of Thomson SA.</p>
<p>More than 3.5 million shares in Lagardere changed hands during the day, but a surge of 5.3 percent soon petered out. The stock slid into the red in the afternoon on profit-taking before creeping back to end at 177.8, up 0.68 percent.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1615 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.5345 marks and 112.37 yen, compared with Monday's London close of 1.5357 marks and 112.72 yen .</p>
<p>STOCKS -- CLOSING INDICES</p>
<p>London - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares closed own 15.9 points, or 0.39 percent, at 4,057.2.</p>
<p>Paris - The CAC-40 share index fell 6.61 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,175.61.</p>
<p>Frankfurt - The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade down 10.05 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,718.98. In later computerised trade the IBIS DAX index fell 11.93 points to 2,721.74.</p>
