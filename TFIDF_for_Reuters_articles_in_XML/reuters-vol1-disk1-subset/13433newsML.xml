<p>Dutch publishing group VNU is expected to report a rise in ordinary first-half earnings of some 10 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast a net profit from ordinary operations of 132 to 148 million guilders with a consensus around 139 million.</p>
<p>This compares with 126 million guilders in the first half of 1995 after stripping out an extraordinary gain of 160 million on the sale of U.S. investment information unit Disclosure.</p>
<p>Except for commercial television, analysts expect all of VNU's main businesses to have performed well in the first six months of this year, though higher paper prices may have held back the group's magazine and newspaper operations.</p>
<p>Analysts said 1996 earnings growth might appear modest compared with a 26 percent jump in ordinary net profit in 1995.</p>
<p>But they pointed out that the large rise in percentage terms last year was partly due to one-off costs of 20 million guilders in 1994 and an exceptionally strong performance by the group's U.S. business information operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all of VNU's businesses are doing well, with one big exception: commercial TV,&quot; said Andre Moons of ING Barings.</p>
<p>VNU has already said television earnings will decline in 1996 as its channels reorganise to meet the challenge posed by new competitors. But it has predicted a recovery in 1997.</p>
<p>Moons is more cautious about recovery prospects, saying new channels SBS6 and Sport7 could grab advertising revenues from VNU's 38 percent-owned market leader RTL4 and adding that RTL4's partner station Veronica had got off to a disappointing start.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, new technology might enable RTL4 to charge subscription fees, reducing dependence on advertising.</p>
<p>Cees Haasnoot at Effectenbank Stroeve said VNU might face some problems in the short term but that it should be able to raise its gross profit margin in the medium to long term.</p>
<p>VNU has said it expects to raise operating profits to 15 percent of sales in four to five years from just under 12 percent now through expansion in growth areas and further efficiency gains in its more traditional businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe this is a realistic target and that they will indeed achieve it,&quot; said Haasnoot.</p>
<p>Moons agreed the target should be attainable as long as the economy did not slide into recession in the next few years.</p>
