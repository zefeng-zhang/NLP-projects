<p>Australasian food group Goodman Fielder Ltd said it had taken an abnormal accounting charge of A$72.2 million in the current year, for which it reported net profit of A$28.3 million.</p>
<p>Net profit before abnormals was up 3.5 percent at A$100.7 million, the company said.  </p>
<p>In its outlook, Goodman Fielder said: &quot;The company is anticipating that the current improved movement in sale prices, that synergies across the group will begin to be realised and the drive to a more value added margin mix will start to take effect.</p>
<p>&quot;However, particularly as a result of fluctuating world wheat prices, it is too early yet to predict a final earnings outcome for the current year.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodman Fielder said cashflow was strong and net debt fell by A$264.8 million during the year.  </p>
<p>The company recorded a net loss of A$52.8 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>It said the latest result highlighted, in particular, better cash management, real performance turnarounds at Meadow Lea Foods and in Europe and better cost control across the group.</p>
<p>Edible Oils and Food Service Group increased profit 32 percent to A$41.1 million through lifting prices on the back of a 70 percent increase in marketing, and simultaneously driving down costs.  </p>
<p>European Foods Group's better management of European Union rebates, combined with the new focus on improved productivity and on higher margin products, increased profits by 56 percent to A$48.5 million.</p>
<p>Overall Cereals and Snacks Group were marginally down to A$37.6 million from A$38.2 million on six percent higher sales.</p>
<p>Higher wheat prices and heavy competition constrained margins in the Milling and Baking Group. Although nearly all of the group's businesses maintained market share and increased sales, profit was down 8 percent to A$81.1 million.  </p>
<p>The Ingredients Group was badly affected by the BSE scare in Europe, high raw material costs and the strong Australian dollar. All these factors combined to reduce profits by 14 percent to A$27.7 million.</p>
<p>Poultry Group had a poor year with a 36 percent fall in profit to A$9.6 million. The international group saw strong growth in export sales into Asia while the group's south west Pacific operations felt the impact of higher wheat costs and depressed economic conditions in almost all of the local island economies. --Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746</p>
