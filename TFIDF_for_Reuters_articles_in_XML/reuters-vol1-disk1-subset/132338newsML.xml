<p>Inco Ltd's 1996 nickel production will likely be about 15 million pounds lower than in 1995 because of a labor dispute in Manitoba and a broken furnace in Indonesia, the company said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Total production for the year was expected to be 415 million pounds of nickel, compared to about 430 million pounds last year, Inco president Scott Hand told a conference call.</p>
<p>&quot;Production was going pretty well, indeed a lot better than last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the third-quarter production problems hurt, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will come out around 415 millon pounds, affected primarily by the furnace eruption at PT Inco -- which will reduce their production by around seven million pounds -- and by the stoppage in Manitoba, (which is) another six million pounds or so,&quot; Hand said.</p>
<p>Inco locked out its workers in Thompson, Manitoba for 14 days this autumn over a contract dispute.</p>
<p>The company lost the use of one of three furnaces at its Indonesian facilities after an explosion.</p>
<p>The accident is under investigation and has not hampered the budget or expansion schedule in Indonesia, he said.  </p>
<p>The coming year will likely bring better nickel prices than the &quot;disappointing&quot; 1996 levels, said John Jones, assistant vice-president of marketing.</p>
<p>Supply and demand in the nickel market had been in balance for most of the year, he said.</p>
<p>But the balance was poised to change with stronger economies and rising stainless steel demand expected in the fourth quarter, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We are guardedly optimistic going into the next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company said it discovered some &quot;interesting&quot; mineralization at its Voisey's Bay property.  </p>
<p>Exploration exposed mineralization to the east and south of the Eastern Deeps area at the remote Labrador project, said Bob Horn, vice-president of exploration.</p>
<p>The company also found high nickel and copper grades to the west of its Western Extension deposit, Horn said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very good chance of increasing our reserves in that area,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Inco also found mineralization to the north, but Horn said it was too early to release any numbers.</p>
<p>Inco was also hoping to grow in Brazil and Turkey, he said.</p>
