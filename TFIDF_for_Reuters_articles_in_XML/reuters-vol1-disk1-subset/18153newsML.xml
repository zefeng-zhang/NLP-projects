<p>A group of 93 U.S. investors in Lloyd's of London will ask a U.S. appeals court to reconsider its decision Tuesday lifting an injunction that had kept the the British insurance giant from proceeding with its reorganization, an attorney for the investors said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're planning to file tomorrow afternoon an emergency motion for a rehearing,&quot; said Stephens Clay of Kilpatrick &amp; Cody, who represents the investors, known as Names.  </p>
<p>If the three-judge panel denies the motion, he said, the plaintiffs will ask the entire U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the matter.</p>
<p>The appeals court panel in Baltimore Tuesday threw out an injunction issued Friday by a U.S. district judge in Richmond Va. that Lloyd's said could have led to its collapse.</p>
<p>The appeals court said the lower court judge erred in imposing the injunction because investors had signed contracts specifying disputes would be settled in British courts.</p>
<p>The appellate court then sent the case back to the district court with instructions to dismiss it.</p>
