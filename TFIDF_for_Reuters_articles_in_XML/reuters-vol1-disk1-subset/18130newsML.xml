<p>Energy will be the key to the Asia-Pacific region's economic growth into the next century, Australian Energy Minister Warwick Parer told the inaugural APEC energy ministers' meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Parer said the Asia-Pacific's ability to meet growing energy demand to fuel a forecast 3.3 percent annual growth rate would determine whether the region was the driver of global growth beyond 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Energy in its various manifestations is central to this,&quot; said Parer in opening the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.</p>
<p>But the region would need US$1.6 trillion in capital investment to meet energy demands over the next 10 years, he added. &quot;Involvement of the business sector will be vital.&quot;</p>
<p>An industry consultant warned that the Asia-Pacific, which consumes about half the world's energy, was unlikely to meet its growing energy demands because political and economic risks could impact on foreign investment in new energy projects.</p>
<p>APEC expects energy consumption among its 18 members to grow by around 2.2 percent a year to 2010, compared with only 1.0 percent a year for the area represented by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's any way these demand forecasts can be met,&quot; Robert Moeller, energy specialist for management firm Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at a country like China, they have to build the equivalent of one new large central power station a month,&quot; said Moeller, adding demand in India was nearly as high as China.</p>
<p>However, he said both countries had significant problems that outweighed some of the smaller countries grouped under APEC, whose leaders meet for a summit in the Philippines in November.</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.</p>
<p>Delays faced by U.S. firm Enron Corp over gaining clearance for a major power plant in India until recently stunned would-be developers of power projects in India, Moeller said.</p>
<p>There was also the problem of a lack of a comprehensive regulatory or legal framework in some countries that most western firms were familiar with, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result it ends up being quite scary when you think about a billion or multi-billion-dollar investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When the risks of large-scale investments in the larger countries were weighed &quot;it brings those markets down far enough to make places like Thailand and Indonesia and Malaysia also look quite attractive&quot;, Moeller said.</p>
<p>Australia's Parer issued an optimistic note in opening the APEC meeting, saying energy was a fertile ground for co-operation between Asia Pacific nations.</p>
<p>APEC ministers will review a 14-point plan aimed at making investment regimes for energy more attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;Visionary policies to respond to these energy challenges will be required,&quot; he said.</p>
