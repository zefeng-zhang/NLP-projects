<p>Ten gunmen seized a Filipino businessman, his wife and their three-year-old son on Tuesday on southern Mindanao island in the latest of a spate of kidnappings in the Philippines, police said.</p>
<p>The businessman, Weny Ballano, and his family were in a car when the gunmen flagged it down and abducted them in a village in Sultan Kudarat province.</p>
<p>The kidnappers escaped on a boat with their victims, leaving behind the car's driver, police said.</p>
<p>Despite repeated government pledges to crack down on kidnappers, crime gangs have abducted more than 100 people around the country this year, collecting 36.2 million pesos ($1.35 million) in ransom, according to police.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven of the kidnappings occurred in the Manila area, with the victims mostly members of wealthy Chinese families.</p>
<p>Police and soldiers have often been linked to the kidnappings, and Chinese community sources say they believe many of the gangs are protected by senior officers.</p>
