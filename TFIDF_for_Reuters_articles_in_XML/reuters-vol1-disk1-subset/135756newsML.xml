<p>The deficit of the beleaguered state-run road accident insurance fund had grown to six billion rand, the parliamentary public accounts committee heard on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund (MMF) chief executive Willem Swanepoel told the committee that the fund's accumulated deficit had grown from 3.8 billion rand in 1993/94 to 4.2 billion in 1994/94 and was still growing.</p>
<p>In 1995/96, outstanding claims totalled 7.35 billion rand while the fund had one billion rand in assets, leaving a deficit of six billion rand.</p>
<p>Swanepoel said there had been a &quot;marked increase&quot; in the number and amounts of claims and the situation had not been helped by the fact that there had not been an increase in income received in the form of a fuel levy between 1993 and 1996.</p>
<p>This meant that any increase in the income of the fund hinged on the growth in the volume of fuel sold, which had averaged about five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the meantime the claims...increased by something like 20 percent,&quot; Swanepoel said.</p>
<p>The fuel levy had been increased to 10.5 cents on petrol and 6.8 cents on diesel in August, which translated into a 17 percent increase in levy income.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome as it is, it is of course totally inadequate and hardly pays for the claims that arise in a given year, let alone work off the accumulated deficit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The best way to fund the deficit would be to increase the fuel levy by 15 percent a year, which Transport Minister Mac Maharaj had said was &quot;politically unacceptable&quot;.</p>
<p>The MMF had suggested in 1995 that benefits be capped to cut total payments by 41.5 percent and a 8.8 percent increase in the fuel levy over the next 10 years to fully fund total liabilities.</p>
<p>Since then, there had been a marked increase in the number of claims and the picture was much bleaker a year later, Swanepoel said.</p>
