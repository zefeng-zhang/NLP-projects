<headline>U.S. welcomes Netanyahu-Arafat meeting.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>The United States welcomed Wednesday's meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat as a &quot;very good day&quot; for Middle East peace.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome it. This is a very positive development from the standpoint of the United States,&quot; said State Department spokesman Glyn Davies.</p>
<p>The meeting at the Israel-Gaza border was the first between Arafat and Netanyahu, who was elected in May. Netanyahu had previously refused to meet the former Palestinian guerrilla chief.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton in a statement said: &quot;The meeting between the two leaders is a very important step in developing an Israeli-Palestinian partnership so essential to implementation of their agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu visits Washington next week and Clinton's statement, read by Press Secretary Mike McCurry,  said: &quot;I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu next Monday to review progress and discuss developments in the region.&quot;</p>
<p>Davis told a news briefing that the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting was &quot;a very important step in creating the kind of atmosphere that we believe is necessary for successful implementation of Israeli-Palestinian agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It also shows a commitment on the part of the Israelis and the Palestinians to work to resolve their differences through negotiations ... Today is a very good day on that track of the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Washington has pressed for such a meeting, but Davies said a suggestion that it had threatened to call off Netanyahu's visit unless he met Arafat &quot;sounds a little bit blunt for the kind of high-level dialogue that we maintain with the Israelis&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We've tried where we can to be helpful as the Israelis and the Palestinians worked to get past some of the very serious differences that have arisen in recent weeks and months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And we plan to continue to play that role to the extent the parties would like us to.&quot;</p>
<p>A meeting of countries contributing funds to support the Palestinian Authority that exercises self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza will take place in Washington on Thursday, Davies said.</p>
