<p>The chairman of South Korea's Daewoo Group was summoned by Seoul prosecutors on Tuesday in connection with a probe into bribery allegations involving a former defence minister, a group spokesman said.</p>
<p>Yoon Young-suk, chairman of Daewoo and chief executive officer of Daewoo Heavy Industries, returned on Tuesday morning to South Korea from an overseas business trip, spokesman Lee Chong-seung said.  </p>
<p>South Korea's main opposition party has alleged an arms dealer was paid bribes of 300 million won ($362,000) by Daewoo Heavy to arrange a government purchase of military helicopters and then paid half the money to former defence minister Lee Yang-ho.</p>
<p>Lee Yang-ho has denied the accusation. He was dismissed last week by President Kim Young-sam.</p>
<p>A second Daewoo spokesman, Kim Yoon-shik, said Daewoo Heavy had paid up to 300 million won to the arms dealer but the money was a commission not a bribe.</p>
<p>Prosecutors denied all comment on the case. ($1 = 827.60 won)</p>
