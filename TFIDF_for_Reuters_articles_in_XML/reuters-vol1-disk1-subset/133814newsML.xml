<headline>Lockheed Martin earnings up 8 percent.</headline>
<dateline>BETHESDA, Md. 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lockheed Martin said Tuesday its earnings rose 8 percent in the third quarter and cited cost-cutting and increased sales due to its acquisition of Loral Corp.</p>
<p>The Bethesda, Md.-based defence company said it earned $311 million, or $1.55 a share, in the third quarter vs. $287 million, or $1.43 a share.</p>
<p>Sales rose 27 percent to $7.03 billion from $5.55 billion. The company said the increase in sales was due mostly to its acquisition in April of Loral Corp.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin's earnings per share were on target with Wall Street expectations, but its shares fell $1 to $91.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Lockheed said it expected savings of $2.5 billion a year after 1999 as a result of its restructuring and a government policy of sharing defence consolidation costs and savings with contractors.</p>
<p>In addition the company said its order backlog in the third quarter fell to $49.1 billion from $50.1 billion in the second quarter, partly as a result of the end of the goverernment's fiscal year.</p>
<p>For the first nine months, Lockheed earned $882 million, or $4.40 a share, on sales of $19.21 billion. A year earlier, the company earned $371 million, or $1.72 a share, on sales of $16.80 billion. The year earlier period included charges of $690 million, or $1.96 a share, related to merger expenses.</p>
