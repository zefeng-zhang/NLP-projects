<title>SINGAPORE: ASIAN EXOTICS - Bullish dollar weighs on regionals.</title>

<p>Most regional currencies bowed to the dollar's strength on Monday as the U.S. unit continued its upward march, hitting a morning high of 112.85 yen in Tokyo.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the release of trade data showing a slightly sharper-than-expected decline in September non-oil exports added to the Sing dollar's bleak outlook.</p>
<p>But the market showed no immediate reaction to news that non-oil exports fell a nominal 6.2 percent year-on-year in September to S$7.31 billion after falling 6.3 percent in August.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of 12 Singapore-based economists had predicted a nominal year-on-year fall of 3.4 percent in September.</p>
<p>The Singapore dollar was quoted at 1.4145/55 at 0445 GMT against an opening 1.4140/1.4145.</p>
<p>&quot;The currency's inching rather than steamrolling,&quot; said a European bank dealer, adding that the U.S. dollar faced resistance at S$1.4155/60.</p>
<p>He said a sustained break above that level would put the U.S. dollar on track towards a target of S$1.43.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Thai baht slipped to 25.492-25.497 at 0445 GMT against 25.488-25.493 late on Friday, but tightened domestic liquidity inhibited active dollar buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was strong bidding for the dollar this morning. But transactions were very limited as tightening liquidity hindered some dollar interest,&quot; said a currency dealer in Bangkok.</p>
<p>The Thai overnight interbank rate rose near a one-month high of 13.00-13.50 percent in early trade as the Bank of Thailand's October 22 reserve requirement and speculative dollar buying drained liquidity from the system.</p>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah held steady as players remained wary of a higher fixing by the central bank later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Players are taking a wait-and-see attitude on speculation the central bank may raise the fixing rate by one point later today,&quot; said a European bank dealer in Jakarta.</p>
<p>The dealer said Bank Indonesia did not usually raise the fixing on Mondays, but last week's unexpected rises prompted players to speculate on a one-point rise.</p>
<p>He said the central bank might raise the intervention and conversion rates by another three points this week.</p>
<p>The intervention rate was set at 2,323.00/2,515.00 and the conversion rate at 2,323.00/2,371 on Friday.</p>
<p>A U.S. bank dealer, however, said some rupiah buying by state-owned banks helped keep the rupiah underpinned.</p>
<p>The Malaysian ringgit remained prey to continuing commercial demand for the dollar, but dealers said activity was likely to be slow ahead of the annual budget on October 25.</p>
<p>&quot;People are expecting a good budget so the ringgit should be stronger. But I'm hearing there's good commercial demand around 2.5050,&quot; said a European bank dealer in Singapore.</p>
<p>He said the dollar would need to close above technical resistance at 2.5080 ringgit to head towards a medium-term target of 2.52.</p>
<p>Another dealer said selling interest from funds around the 2.5080 level could slow the ringgit's decline. It was quoted at 2.5069/79 at 0445 GMT against 2.5065/75 on Friday.</p>
