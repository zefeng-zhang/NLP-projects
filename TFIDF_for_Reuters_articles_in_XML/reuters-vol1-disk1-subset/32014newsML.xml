<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat held their first summit on Wednesday, promising to pursue peace together.</p>
<p>But the hour-long meeting at the Israel-Gaza border began awkwardly with a brief handshake too quick to photograph and did not resolve main sticking points: the date and scope of Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>An Israeli-Palestinian steering committee will begin meeting on Thursday to tackle that issue and others, Terje Larsen, the U.N.'s top official in the self-ruled West Bank and Gaza, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that we will work with Mr Bibi (Netanyahu) and his government to push the peace process, the peace of the brave,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both parties reiterate their commitment to the interim agreement and their determination to carry out its implementation,&quot; Netanyahu said, referring to self-rule deals between the previous Israeli government and the PLO.</p>
<p>But he told a news conference: &quot;We have to take into account the needs and requirements of both sides on the basis of reciprocity and the assurance of the security and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinians alike.&quot;</p>
<p>Reciprocity is the term Netanyahu uses to make implementation of past peace deals conditional on an end to what he has termed Palestinian violations of the accords, especially alleged self-rule activity in Jerusalem, a city Israel controls.</p>
<p>By security, Netanyahu means protection for the 400 Jewish settlers living among more than 100,000 Arabs in Hebron.</p>
<p>Protecting them, Israeli officials have said, entails revising the troop redeployment set in a 1995 agreement, something Palestinians have opposed.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said the decision to discuss Hebron further &quot;clarifies to the Palestinians...that the issue is not yet closed&quot;.</p>
<p>Arafat appeared to be content with the victory Palestinian officials said he achieved by getting a reluctant Netanyahu to meet him, and gave a muted response when asked at the news conference about the Hebron issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I have nothing to add but to state that we will continue to negotiate and to coordinate all efforts, by all means,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;The road is paved for the negotiations between us on all aspects and at every level, including the final-status talks, of course,&quot; he said. But Palestinian officials said from their perspective the talks were on implementation rather than changing previous accords.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, with the help of Larsen, a Norwegian middleman who helped broker the original Oslo self-rule accord in 1993, had struggled over the past week to find a formula for a summit and full-scale peace talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's agreement to meet Arafat followed some tough talk and strident action from the Palestinian leader.</p>
<p>Arafat said last week's Israeli decision to expand Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza and its policy on Jerusalem were tantamount to declaring war on the Palestinians.</p>
<p>He also called a four-hour general strike in the two areas last Thursday, the first such stoppage in two years.</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Arafat started the meeting at the Israel-Gaza border with a quick handshake that caught photographers off-guard.</p>
<p>They shook hands again -- this time for four seconds -- as cameras clicked but ignored shouted appeals from photographers at the end of their news conference for another replay.</p>
<p>The meeting followed four days of round-the-clock talks to fix a summit seen as vital to reviving peace talks suspended since Islamic suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
<p>In Israel's May election, Netanyahu ousted Prime Minister Shimon Peres who in November succeeded Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated by a Jew opposed to peace moves with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May on a vow to take a hard line in peace talks with the Palestinians, had said originally he preferred not to meet Arafat but softened his position in recent days.</p>
