<p>China's central bank announced on Wednesday it had cut interest rates on its loans to commercial banks in a move to reduce the interest rate burden on the financial system.</p>
<p>The People's Bank of China also cut the interest it pays to commercial banks on funds it holds for them as reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank is reducing the burden of the banks ...in line with various market conditions,&quot; the China Securities newspaper said in a commentary alongside the announcement of the new rates.</p>
<p>It said interest on central bank loans to commercial banks had been trimmed by an average of 0.39 percentage point. That brought the rate for three-month funds to 9.72 percent from 10.08 percent and one-year funds to 10.62 percent from 10.98 percent.</p>
<p>China's state run banks have been struggling to stay profitable as their own cost of funds is high.</p>
<p>The newly-announced rates went into effect last Friday, the same day the central bank set new rates for loans by commercial banks to their customers and for the interest they pay depositors.</p>
<p>The series of interest rate reductions was made possible by an easing of domestic inflation.</p>
<p>China's retail prices rose 6.9 percent over the first seven months of the year, well within the official target of 10 percent for this year and down sharply from the 14.8 percent in all of 1995.</p>
<p>Retail prices reached a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>The People's Bank has been under pressure to bring interest rates down to help banks as well as their customers, many of them cash-strapped state enterprises.</p>
<p>In its latest move, the central bank slashed the interest on two types of reserves to 8.28 percent and 7.92 percent. Previously it paid 8.82 percent on both types of reserves held in its accounts on behalf of the commercial banks.</p>
<p>&quot;This clearly is favourable to the central bank because it has cut its own cost of funds by more than the interest on its loans,&quot; said an economist who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank itself is saving money,&quot; he said.</p>
