<p>Russia on Wednesday rejected U.S. intelligence findings that control of its nuclear arsenal was weakening, saying it was one of the few areas of Russian life not hit by chaos and economic problems.</p>
<p>Some independent analysts said nuclear weapons were affected by a lack of cash, but they dismissed fears that they might fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian and American specialists are working hand in hand in the field of military use of nuclear energy and our American collegues have expressed no reservations,&quot; Georgy Nasonov, a spokesman for Russia's atomic energy ministry, said by telephone.</p>
<p>The leaked Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report, quoted in a U.S. newspaper, concluded that controls had become less strict because of dramatic social change in Russia and accompanying economic problems and low morale in the military.</p>
<p>But it said the chance of an unauthorised launch or blackmail remained low. The State Department also said Washington believed Russia had control over its nuclear force.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no doubt about the control over strategic missile forces,&quot; said a spokesman for the Russian military organisation which oversees controls of the nuclear arsenal, the National Centre for Reduction of Nuclear Danger.</p>
<p>&quot;An inspection group from the United States is arriving today, and tomorrow they will be checking how our strategic forces are controlled. We are ready for this check.&quot;</p>
<p>Big delays in wage payments in the armed forces have raised concern that disgruntled soldiers might take matters into their own hands, but officials say the salary problem does not affect those dealing with strategically important installations.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians and independent commentators strayed little from the official line.</p>
<p>Andrei Zobov, an independent nuclear expert, said his own sources had not expressed any worries. &quot;People I trust say that security is good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Alexander Golts, a commentator for the defence ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, also said Russia's economic problems had not so far affected the security of the nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>&quot;The chaos in the country has not resulted in the slightest problem in this field,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Washington Times cited the report as warning of &quot;conspiracies within nuclear-armed units&quot; to commit blackmail involving the arsenal of 28,000 nuclear-tipped weapons.</p>
<p>It said this had become a concern due to falling living standards, which it said had even affected the elite forces handling nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;One must always have greater and greater controls because there is always the risk of terrorist attacks, but they just seem to be speculating that there could be a chance of nuclear blackmail,&quot; Zobov said.</p>
<p>Alexei Arbatov, deputy head of parliament's defence committee and a member of the liberal opposition Yabloko party, dismissed the possibility of a blackmail threat as &quot;rubbish&quot;.</p>
<p>But he told Reuters: &quot;It's a different matter that the installations where nuclear weapons are stored, and the equipment, are getting older and need urgent modernisation. This really is a serious problem...In this sense there is a bit of truth in the report.&quot;</p>
<p>Arbatov and Golts both recalled problems in electricity supply to military units including those housing nuclear submarines, due to unpaid bills, but said the danger was blocked after local officials were forbidden to repeat the power cuts.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Russia said it fired four cruise missiles as part of routine tests of its nuclear defences. Igor Sergeyev, the commander-in-chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, said they had shown his forces' reliability and technical readiness.</p>
<p>Former security chief Alexander Lebed used a more colourful description of Russia's nuclear arsenal. The missiles were &quot;rusty but effective&quot; he said before his ouster last week for rocking the Kremlin boat.</p>
