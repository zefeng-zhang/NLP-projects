<headline>Brazil shares end lower on technical correction.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazil's shares closed down 1.81 percent in a technical correction after Monday's options settlement, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index  of the 42 most-traded shares fell 1,233 points to close at 66,756 points. Turnover was moderate at 413.1 million reais ($401.6 million)  </p>
<p>The bourse is seen opening higher on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>In addition, analysts said players would continue to speculate on a Supreme Court decision on a probe over a Telebras share subscription totalling 7 billion shares, made in 1992.</p>
<p>This subscription was blocked by a federal court which called for an investigation based on allegations that the share price was below the firm's value.</p>
<p>The court could rule that Telebras must issue the 7 billion shares or pay back investors $90 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the court rules that Telebras should issue the shares, the market will fall,&quot; said a trader, noting that Telebras' daily volume is 2 billion to 3 billion shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The best decision would be to have them pay the $90 million because that would not affect us at all,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some analysts, however, shrugged off the possible effects of an issue of 7 billion Telebras shares on the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just a reason to speculate and make money. Telebras shares will only fall if all the investors holding these 7 billion shares go at the same time to the market,&quot; said one analyst.  </p>
<p>Telebras preferred ended off 2.91 percent at 80 reais. Power firm Eletrobras dropped 0.6 percent to close at 332 reais. Mining giant Vale do Rio Doce preferred stock ended at 21.05 reais, down 0.71 percent. Petrobras preferred fell 3.31 percent to close at 131.50 reais.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo bourse's power sector index comprising nine most liquid stocks of the electrical sector (IEE) dropped 0.29 percent to close at 1,811 points, a bourse spokeswoman said.</p>
