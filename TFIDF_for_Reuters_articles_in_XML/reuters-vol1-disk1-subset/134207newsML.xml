<p>India's central bank initiatives on the weekend to boost liquidity and cut lending rates will have a positive impact on bank profits if they spur credit growth, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The reduction in cash reserve ratio (CRR) by two percentage points and the decrease in term deposit rate by one percentage point will positively impact banking sector profitability,&quot; ICICI Securities and Finance (I-Sec) said in a report.</p>
<p>It said the cut in CRR and a reduction in maximum interest payable on deposits up to one year, to 10 percent a year from 11 percent, announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday, should theoretically result in a proportionate increase in profits.</p>
<p>But some analysts said while the overall impact of the monetary policy for the second half of 1996/97 (April-March) would be positive, it might not translate to immediate profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The advantage of the CRR cut, to a large extent, will be nullified by the deposit rate cut,&quot; said S.R. Krishnan, analyst at Peregrine Capital India. He did not expect more than a marginal increase in bank profits for the current year.</p>
<p>The RBI said the decision to cut the CRR and deposit rate were aimed at prompting a cut in the lending rate. The state-run Bank of Baroda, immediately announced a cut in its prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 15.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Every cut in CRR gives additional earnings,&quot; RBI governor Chakravarty Rangarajan told a news conference on Saturday. The CRR cut, in four stages, would release over 85 billion rupees ($2.4 billion) of funds locked up with the central bank, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;State Bank of India profits should rise,&quot; said a vice-president of a private bank. &quot;But for most other banks, profits should be around the same level as last year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For State Bank of India, two percentage points (cut in the CRR) means lots of money which they can invest anywhere,&quot; he said. He said most other state-run banks would find the cost of retaining funds high.</p>
<p>The changes would impact on profits only in 1997/98, a bank treasurer said. &quot;The deposit rates won't come down fast as the reduced rate applies only to new deposits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he said bank profits should grow next year provided credit picks up. But there was no sign of this yet, he said.</p>
<p>Banks have complained of a fall in credit this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks will record about seven to eight percent growth in earnings per share for 1996/97,&quot; I-Sec said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the benefit of the reduction in cost will be felt for the entire 12 months during 1997/98, compared to only six months in 1996/97. Banks will correspondingly record stronger earnings growth in 1997/98,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Amit Rajpal, analyst at Prime Broking, said he expected banks to record a fall in interest income this year. &quot;I don't see much allocation going into credit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy will be more or less profit-neutral,&quot; he said.</p>
