<p>Hong Kong stocks ended lower on Tuesday in what brokers called a much-needed correction, while Tokyo stocks also eased on continuing poor sentiment over last weekend's election.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Thai stocks rose for the fifth consecutive session and Indian's shares leapt on the central bank's latest credit policy. But South Korean shares slipped 1.61 per cent in what brokers said was a consolidation after the last week's rises.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 closed at 21,123.68, down 179.27 points, or 0.84 percent, in a market brokers said was unable to recover from the bleak sentiment caused by Sunday's Lower House elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom was fairly limited,&quot; said Katsuhiko Kodama, general manager at Toyo Securities. &quot;Foreign investors were not selling fiercely, and bargain hunters went into action whenever the benchmark dipped.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Nikkei average is looking to consolidate around the 21,000 level,&quot; Kodama said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks closed lower after a late afternoon slide which brokers described as a bout of overdue profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;This market was long overdue for a short-term correction,&quot; said Francis Wong, head of regional sales at DBS Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index shed 65.39 points to 12,444.66.</p>
<p>&quot;While we saw some lock in profits today, locally based funds are not selling because the property market outlook is improving,&quot; said Patrick Ho, sales director at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>Thai stocks ended one percent higher with some investors buying shares of companies that have yet to release third quarter results, while other investors sold finance shares after sluggish results, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index closed 9.53 points higher to 958.05.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors thought that most of the earning results of finance companies during the third quarter weren't good,&quot; said Busaba Kunasirin of Chao Phya Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>The market will be closed on Wednesday for a holiday.</p>
<p>In Bombay, the 30-share index rose a provisional 98.75 points, or 3.15 percent, to 3,228.96 fuelled by the central bank's new credit policy announced at the weekend, brokers said.</p>
<p>The policy proposed to free impounded bank funds and cut the interest cap on short-term deposits, moves that prompted banks to reduce lending rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise is the fall-out of the credit policy,&quot; said Amish Choksi, a dealer at broking firm Amit Nalinkant.</p>
<p>He said the market was driven by local buyers while foreign institutional investors were booking profits.</p>
<p>The dollar slipped against the mark in Tokyo on selling by overseas operators and mark buying for yen by Japanese operators in cross trade.</p>
<p>The dollar traded at 112.55/65 yen and 1.5316/19 marks, compared with New York's previous close of 112.71/76 yen and 1.5342/45 marks. BY 1100 GMT, the dollar was trading at 112.74/79 yen and 1.5344/49 marks.</p>
<p>In Singapore, SIMEX Brent December futures fell in line with weaker values on NYMEX crudes, with December Brent futures last traded at $24.52 per barrel, down 12 cents from London's settlement on Monday of $24.64.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, bullion ended at US$382.30/382.80 an ounce, against New York's previous close of US$381.75/382.25.</p>
