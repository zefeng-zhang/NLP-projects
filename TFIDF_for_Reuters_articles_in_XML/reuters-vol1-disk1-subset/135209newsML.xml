<p>As thousands of heads craned to watch the jets soar overhead during the first Seoul Air Show, at least one pilot was just as fascinated by the view of the ground below him.</p>
<p>Oleg Tsoi, a second generation Russian of Korean ancestry, is a test pilot for Russia's Sukhoi Design Center.</p>
<p>Sukhoi's Su-37 is considered to be one of the top contenders for South Korea's FX jet fighter programme. And Tsoi is one of two Russian pilots trying to impress South Korean air force generals by showing off the Sukhoi's range of fighters.</p>
<p>&quot;I am so happy to be here in Korea,&quot; the thrice-decorated Tsoi said on Tuesday. &quot;I visited the city centre yesterday and everyone seemed very rich and living very well.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsoi was born in 1944 in Uzbekistan, the son of a rice farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Back then, all the Koreans lived together and we farmed near a large dam. Every year the dam would break and our harvest would be damaged,&quot; he recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to climb on top of the dam and watch planes fly from a nearby airforce base, first turbo-props, then MiGs. I thought it would be a way to escape.&quot;</p>
<p>Sitting in the hospitality area of the Sukhoi Design Bureau's air show tent wearing his navy blue flight suit, a relaxed Tsoi has clearly come a long way from those early years.</p>
<p>With flourescent yellow framed Rayban sunglasses perched on top of his short cropped hair, he looked out over the air field with the contented air of a man who had lived his dreams.</p>
<p>Tsoi joined the Soviet air force straight after high school, and served in Turkmenistan. He retired from service in 1994 with the rank of colonel.</p>
<p>He now lives in Moscow with his Korean-Russian wife Anya and their three sons.</p>
<p>&quot;I would love to bring my family here to visit,&quot; he said. &quot;I know I have family here, though I don't know where or who they are. But a test pilot doesn't make enough money to travel overseas very much.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what he wanted to do with his free time during the air show, Tsoi said he wanted to go to a farm.</p>
<p>&quot;I grew up planting rice. I want to see a Korean farm and touch the earth,&quot; he said.</p>
