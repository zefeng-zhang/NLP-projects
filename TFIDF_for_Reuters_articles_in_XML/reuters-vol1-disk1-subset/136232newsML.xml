<p>British retail sales dipped in September, official figures showed on Wednesday, providing evidence that while high street shops are busy there is little danger of a runaway consumer boom.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said retail sales fell 0.3 percent in September compared with a 0.9 percent rise in August.</p>
<p>But longer-term measures showed consumer spending was still growing fast. The ONS said sales were 3.5 percent higher than in September a year ago.</p>
<p>This was a welcome boost to the ruling Conservatives who are eager to restore a strong sense of economic wellbeing before the general election, which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>Government officials pounced on the figures as evidence the consumer-led recovery is still on track.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in September sales followed a rise in August, and the two months together suggest conditions in the high (main) street are bustling,&quot; said Treasury minister Angela Knight.</p>
<p>A sharp fall in sales of clothing and footwear was the main culprit in dragging down overall retail activity in September.</p>
<p>Prices in this sector rose sharply in September and economists said retailers appeared to be finding it difficult to coax thrifty consumers into paying higher prices.</p>
<p>Sales of textiles, clothing and footwear fell 3.0 percent in September after jumping 2.2 percent in August. Clothing and footwear prices leapt by 5.2 percent in September.</p>
