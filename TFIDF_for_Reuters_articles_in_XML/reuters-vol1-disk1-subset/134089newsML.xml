<p>The European Commission launched a three-point plan on Tuesday intended to cut into the pile of environmental infringement cases on officials' desks by having more complaints tackled by national authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of EU environmental legislation in member states is not good enough and must be improved,&quot; European Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said in a news statement released in Brussels.</p>
<p>Her remarks came after the Commission, at a meeting in Strasbourg, agreed a paper suggesting ways for the EU's 15 countries to improve compliance with laws intended to tackle problems such as air pollution and water and waste treatment.</p>
<p>Suggestions included the creation of guidelines for countries to set up systems to check on implementation, an examination of countries' complaints-handling procedures and a look at how environmental groups and others might pursue, in national courts, legal actions against suspected law-breakers.</p>
<p>Officials said these would not affect Commission powers to start its own infringement proceedings against member states.</p>
<p>While officials declined to name names on Tuesday, they said little had changed since last year's report on member state implementation of rules covering such things as habitat protection, access to information and environmental impact assessment requirements for infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The report singled out Belgium as the worst offender for transposing EU law into national legislation.</p>
<p>Of the 133 EU directives applicable to Belgium at the end of last year, it had indicated compliance with only 111, or 83 percent. Not far in front was Italy, with 85 percent, Portugal and Finland, with 87 percent, and Greece, with 88 percent.</p>
<p>At the top of the class came the Netherlands and Denmark, who indicated compliance with 98 percent of applicable directives, ahead of France and Ireland on 95 percent with Sweden and Germany a further percentage point behind.</p>
