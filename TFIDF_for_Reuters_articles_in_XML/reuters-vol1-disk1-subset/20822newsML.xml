<p>Fears of an autumn of industrial unrest in France drove Paris stocks down sharply on Thursday and hit the franc, which fell to a five-month low against the mark at one stage.</p>
<p>The rest of Europe put on a mixed performance and the dollar marked time with most traders distracted by the mark's movements, particularly against the weak franc.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse recovered some of its losses but was still down 0.66 percent by mid-morning, depressed by concerns that French unions were preparing to challenge the conservative government in the autumn over its social and economic policies.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at a context similar to that of November 1995 (when public sector unions struck for three weeks), possibly worse,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The worries over industrial unrest and the single currency timetable dragged down the franc to 3.4296 per mark -- its worst level since March 25 -- before it regained a little strength by 1100 GMT.</p>
<p>The franc was a victim of of worries over Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in the run-up to 1997 budget presentations. Debate over the EMU timetable and efforts to meet convergence criteria have rekindled fears which had been largely soothed by a European Union show of unity.</p>
<p>Threats of strikes in France have pointed up the difficulty of reconciling fiscal austerity with public resistance to the spending cuts demanded by EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;The French arithmetic will add up -- but the credibility of those sums will be immediately questioned,&quot; said Stuart Thomson, chief international economist at Nikko Europe.</p>
<p>Traders were watching for the mark to hit 3.4305 francs, the top of its old trading range in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), before the fluctuation bands were widened in 1993, analysts said.</p>
<p>Further pressure on the franc was prompted by nerves over French jobless figures out on Friday. High unemployment in many European countries is putting pressure on governments' efforts to curb budget deficits.</p>
<p>In contrast, the dollar had a quiet day. It was barely changed against the mark and slightly down on the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar hasn't got a life of its own,&quot; said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered, adding that if the mark strengthened further against other European currencies, the dollar would come under pressure.</p>
<p>Other European equity markets were mixed, with London slipping slightly after recent gains that saw its FTSE index hit a new closing high of 3918.7 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a tad of caution here ahead of the U.S. holiday (Labour Day) and the U.S. (employment) numbers next week,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some good results this morning, but the broad market has nothing new to grab on to,&quot; said another. &quot;We're at the whim of the wind.&quot;</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks slipped in and out of positive territory with markets lacking direction after a neutral overnight close on Wall Street.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 108.33 yen and 1.4777 marks compared with Wednesday's European close of 108.45 yen and 1.4770 marks</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was down 7.6 at 3911.1.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was down 2.82 at 2560.34. Trading on the computerised IBIS index was up 3.59 at 2560.23.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 was down 12.83 at 1990.07.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $388.05 an ounce, compared to Wednesday's close of $388.55. Silver was at $5.19, down two cents.</p>
