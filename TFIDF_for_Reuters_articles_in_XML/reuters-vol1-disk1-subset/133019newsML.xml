<p>Sky-high refining costs and intense competition in retail gasoline sales combined to weaken the third-quarter earnings of Canadian integrated oil giants Imperial Oil Ltd. and Shell Canada Ltd.</p>
<p>Analysts had served notice that profits at Canada's integrated oil companies would be strained because of the recent run-up in crude oil prices, which increased the cost refining, and gasoline price wars in the huge eastern Canadian gasoline market, which cut returns.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Imperial, Canada's biggest energy company, said on Tuesday it earned C$99 million ($73 million) or 58 cents (43 cents) per share in the third quarter, down from C$138 million ($102 million) or 72 cents (53 cents) per share the year before. Revenues in the period totalled C$2.6 billion ($1.9 billion), up from C$2.4 billion ($1.8 billion) in 1995.</p>
<p>Shell Canada of Calgary, 78-percent-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said its third-quarter earnings fell to C$73 million ($54 million) or 65 cents (48 cents) per share from C$98 million ($73 million) or C87 cents (64 cents) per share in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Revenues increased to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) from C$1.24 billion ($918 million) in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Another Canadian integrated firm, Suncor Inc., also posted lower profits last week.</p>
<p>But Imperial, 69.6-percent-owned by Exxon said its nine-month results were the company's highest ever.</p>
<p>Its year-to-date profits, which were C$588 million ($435 million), up from C$421 million ($312 million) in 1995, include a gain of C$250 million ($185 million) from a monstrous tax refund the company pocketed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Third-quarter earnings in Imperial's petroleum products division were C$26 million ($19 million), a big drop from the C$56 million ($41 million) earned last year.</p>
<p>&quot;You had crude oil costs increasing during the quarter and because of the competitive market in all products and not really being able to recover some of that increased cost in the marketplace, margins are certainly smaller,&quot; said Imperial spokesman Richard O'Farrell.</p>
<p>Quebec was the main battleground for gasoline price wars, which saw all the majors' margins squeezed.</p>
<p>Although Shell Canada's fortunes improved in its upstream, or production and development, oil and gas operations thanks to stronger oil and gas prices and higher volumes, refining and markeeting results were also weaker during the period, the company said.</p>
<p>The company's dowstream division &quot;faces a very difficult business environment and we are continuing to examine alternatives to improve on our profitability,&quot; Shell Canada Chief Executive Chuck Wilson said.</p>
<p>During the period, Shell Canada's oil products division earned C$19 million ($14 million), a dramatic drop from the C$73 million ($54 million) earned in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Shell Canada spokeswoman Jan Rowley said the company would continue to improve its downstream results by bolstering refinery reliability, cutting costs and upgrading its service station network.</p>
<p>However, moves being examined do not include sales of any operations or strategic alliances with other retailers, as has been the trend in the United States and Europe, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It continues along the lines of working on those elements of our business that our within our control,&quot; Rowley said.</p>
<p>The company announced earlier this month it would sell its chemical division to a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell for C$635 million ($470 million) by year end. Shell Canada said it expected a C$200 million ($148 million) after-tax gain on the sale. Lower styrene prices have pressured the division's profitability.</p>
