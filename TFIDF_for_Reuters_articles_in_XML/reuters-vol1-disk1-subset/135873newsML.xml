<headline>CSCE says large coffee stock drop due to &quot;errors&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The 24,391 bag drawdown reported in Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) warehouses during the week ended October 18 actually occurred during a different time period but was reported in the latest weekly figures due to &quot;past errors in reporting&quot; by one warehouse, CSCE said in a statement released after the close of business.  </p>
<p>The exchange did not say whether the removal of the stocks, which at the time represented an 80 percent fall in inventory for delivery against coffee futures, occurred over a period of several weeks or months</p>
<p>&quot;The recent decline in warehouse certified stocks of coffee reported by the exchange was attributable to past errors in reporting stocks by a warehouse. The last reported number released by the exchange is correct,&quot; the statement read.</p>
<p>The CSCE did not name the warehouse responsible for the reporting errors, and no one at exchange was available for comment.</p>
<p>On Monday, October 21, the CSCE published its weekly tally of coffee stocks certified for delivery against the &quot;C&quot; futures contract and housed in warehouses in New York, New Orleans, San Francisco and Miami.</p>
<p>Certified stocks, already at their lowest level in a decade, fell by 24,391 bags in the week ended October 18, the exchange reported then, leaving just 5,583 bags available for delivery.</p>
