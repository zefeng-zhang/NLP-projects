<p>Benchmark NYMEX crude futures hit a five-year high in Asian trading on Monday, as a bull run reignited over worries about stocks of heating oil.</p>
<p>The November New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) contract, which trades on the Sydney Futures Exchange, hit $25.86 per barrel.</p>
<p>That came on the back of trading in the main market in New York on Friday, when prices gushed above $25.70 per barrel -- the previous five-year high.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a continuation of Friday's trend,&quot; one crude oil broker said. &quot;People are squeezing up the market. Products prices are strong and people are buying the crude because of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Dwindling heating oil stocks in the United States and Europe have been factors pushing crude oil prices higher all year.</p>
<p>Monday's price for the NYMEX contract is 51 percent higher than the 1996 low of $17.08.</p>
<p>Brent crude oil futures, which trade on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), have been hovering around five-year highs for several weeks.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, Brent was trading on SIMEX at $24.65 per barrel, off the five-year high of $25.06 reached last week, but 55 percent higher than the 1996 low of $15.93.</p>
<p>The problem of low stocks has become a factor as the U.S. and Europe head into winter when heating oil demand soars.</p>
<p>Traditionally, stocks of heating oil rise at this time of year in preparation for the winter.</p>
<p>In Europe, stores of middle distillates, which include heating oil, are at 283 million barrels -- down a massive 33 million barrels from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the United States, supplies of middle distillates total 114 million barrels, almost 18 million barrels less than last year.</p>
<p>Crude prices dipped last week, prompting some traders to believe prices were ready to fall sharply.</p>
<p>But sentiment turned bullish once again after comments by U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary on Friday.</p>
<p>She questioned whether Europe could be expected to continue importing U.S. heating oil on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Her comments came ahead of a meeting with oil executives on Friday to discuss possible adjustments to refinery output and the outlook for prices.</p>
<p>John Lichtblau, an analyst with the Petroleum Research Foundation who attended the meeting, said afterwards there was no indication the government intended to take any action on output.</p>
<p>But traders said O'Leary's comments raised the prospect of limiting U.S. exports to Europe, which could raise prices of heating and crude oil if European buyers are forced to scramble for supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's just an excuse to squeeze the price more,&quot; said one broker, referring to the market's rally.</p>
<p>Besides the low heating oil supplies and cooler temperatures in the northeast U.S., the market's bullish tone should be maintained by fighting among Kurdish groups in northern Iraq and the ouster of Russian security chief Alexander Lebed by President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
