<headline>Europe bunkers ease with crude in thin activity.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>European bunker prices were mostly weaker in line with weaker crude and gas oil futures, but trade across Europe was thin, traders said.</p>
<p>In Rotterdam 380 CST prices dipped a couple of dollars per tonne in line with a slightly weaker fuel oil barge market.</p>
<p>Traded volume was poor and suppliers said the lack of buying interest was also part of the reason why prices were easing.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices found some support after recent fresh demand but traders said sharply weaker crude and gas oil futures saw most grades marked slightly lower and recent buyers headed for the sidelines looking for further reductions.</p>
<p>Prices in Mediterranean ports slipped $1-$2 per tonne from Monday's levels and again traded volumes were minimal.</p>
<p>South African bunkers continued to eased with immediate supply problems easing. Fuel oil 180 CST was talked wider at $126/$129 ex wharf.</p>
