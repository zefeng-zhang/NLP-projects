<headline>French stocks end weaker, Lagardere seesaws.</headline>

<p>French stocks ended a touch weaker on continued but limited consolidation on Tuesday with a see-saw day for magazines-to-missiles group Lagardere after the euphoric reaction to its planned takeover of Thomson SA.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 4.61 points or 0.21 percent at 2,175.61 while the CAC-40 futures contract fell five points to 2,182.0.</p>
<p>Volume was a healthy 5.02 billion francs, of which 3.3 billion was in the CAC-40 shares.</p>
<p>Overall, traders said a relatively robust market could see a bit more slippage -- to 2,150 according to some -- in the wake of a run which took the CAC-40 to a new high last Friday.</p>
<p>More than 3.5 million shares in Lagardere changed hands but a further surge of 5.3 percent soon petered out and the stock slid into the red in the afternoon on profit-taking, before creeping back to end at 177.8, up 0.68 percent.</p>
<p>Tuesday's announcement of a 38 percent jump in first-half net attributable profit to 409 million francs was sidelined by the continued focus on its plans to take over Thomson SA, which is being privatised.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders said a company presentation of the deal provided little new information but a cautious delivery provided room for a pause after the euphoric reaction that sent the stock soaring in recent days on the back of the Thomson news.</p>
<p>Oil giants Elf Aquitaine and Total both gained on oil price firmness, with Elf hitting a new high of 429.0 francs before both stocks eased off their session highs.</p>
<p>Thomson CSF was trading well above the 156 francs offered by Lagardere to buy out minority holders, with some traders talking of speculative buying in the hope that a higher buyout offer from the group could ultimately materialise.</p>
