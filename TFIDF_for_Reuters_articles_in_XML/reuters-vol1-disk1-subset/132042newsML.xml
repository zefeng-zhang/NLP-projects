<p>Sprawling U.S. military bases on the small island of Okinawa and strained ties with China remain Japan's biggest foreign policy issues after general elections.</p>
<p>Neither was a decisive issue in Sunday's election, but Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, staying in command with 239 seats in the 500-seat Lower House of parliament, must deliver on the two problems quickly, government officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably the worst state of relations with China since normalisation in 1978,&quot; a senior Foreign Ministry official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is considering sending a special envoy to China, either former prime minister Noboru Takeshita or LDP adviser Masaharu Gotoda,&quot; the ministry official said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto must mend strained ties with China before he leaves for the Philippines in late November to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where he is sure to come face to face with Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>China was vexed at the election platform of Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which said there was no room for negotiations over the disputed Senkaku Islands, Japanese-controlled islets in the East China Sea. Called the Diaoyus in Chinese, they are claimed by both China and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Last month, a Hong Kong activist drowned near the islands during a protest against a makeshift lighthouse erected by a Japanese ultra-nationalist group.</p>
<p>China also criticised Hashimoto's visit to the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo in July. He was the first Japanese prime minister to visit the shrine since 1985.</p>
<p>Yasukuni enshrines Japan's 2.6 million war dead since the late 19th century, including Class-A war criminals such as World War Two leader General Hideki Tojo.</p>
<p>In Sunday's poll, Hashimoto's LDP increased its strength in the Lower House but was dealt a crushing defeat in Okinawa.</p>
<p>It won none of the three single-seat constituencies on Okinawa, where anti-Tokyo sentiment still runs high from a row over renewal of land leases for the U.S. bases. As much as 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are on Okinawa.</p>
<p>Last month, Okinawans returned a 90 percent &quot;yes&quot; vote in a local referendum supporting calls to cut U.S. military bases. The rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by U.S. servicemen in September 1995 triggered widespread opposition to bases.</p>
<p>Okinawa and Shiga in central Japan were alone among Japan's 47 prefectures in not returning a single LDP candidate.</p>
<p>Under the old multi-seat system, the LDP had always held two of the five seats on Okinawa. A single-seat system was introduced in Sunday's poll.</p>
<p>In moves to form a working majority in parliament, the LDP started coalition talks on Monday with the Social Democrats, who have been very keen to cut back on U.S. bases on Okinawa.</p>
<p>Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota said on Monday: &quot;We are at least delighted that some of our strong supporters, in both the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, to reduce the bases have been re-elected.&quot;</p>
<p>The clearest winner in Sunday's polls were the Communists, who campaigned for the total scrapping of U.S. bases. They won 26 seats compared with 15 in the outgoing chamber.</p>
<p>Next month, foreign and defence ministers from Japan and the United States are due to begin negotiations to rewrite military contingency plans under the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Okinawa will be high on the agenda.</p>
