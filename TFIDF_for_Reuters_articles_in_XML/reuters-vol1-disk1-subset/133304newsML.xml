<p>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter tried on Tuesday to defuse an election crisis in Nicaragua after Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega refused to accept defeat, alleging fraud in the count.</p>
<p>With more than half the vote counted, official results pointed to a big victory for right-wing lawyer Arnoldo Aleman, who launched into victory celebrations and called on the Sandinistas to accept the voters' verdict.</p>
<p>But Ortega, who headed Nicaragua's leftist revolutionary government from 1979-90, told reporters his supporters had found &quot;serious irregularities&quot; and &quot;fraudulent attitudes&quot; in the vote and said he could not accept the result without a recount.</p>
<p>Indignant callers jammed the switchboards of early morning television talk shows in Nicaragua on Tuesday, most attacking the election as fraudulent and others calling for the vote to be annulled.</p>
<p>Observers from the Organisation of American States and the European Union had earlier said they thought the poll was flawed but fair.</p>
<p>Ortega's explosive attack on the count raised fears of violence in a country that spent most of the 1980s in a bloodbath of civil war. Carter, who dealt with Ortega while he was president, stepped in to calm the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;In an effort to expedite the conclusion of the Nicaraguan election, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met tonight with Daniel Ortega, Arnoldo Aleman, President Violeta Chamorro and Dr. Rosa Marina Zelaya, President of the Supreme Electoral Council, to discuss concerns raised by Daniel Ortega,&quot; a statement by Carter said on Monday night.</p>
<p>Carter was to issue a new statement on Tuesday morning about his talks.</p>
<p>With just over half the votes tallied, Aleman led Ortega by 48.54 percent to 38.96 percent -- well clear of the 45 percent hurdle the victor needs to avoid a second-round runoff.</p>
<p>Ortega called on Nicaragua's electoral authorities to double-check the count, and authorities indicated they were willing to do so once the preliminary vote count, expected to end on Tuesday, was wrapped up.</p>
<p>At a news conference on Monday, while supporters shouted &quot;Fraud! Fraud!,&quot; Ortega alleged: &quot;There were alterations in telegrams (of vote results) that were sent in from the departments that meant that many of those telegrams did not precisely reflect the number of votes that the (Sandinista) Front achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Ortega's protests failed to visibly disrupt the victory party at the Liberal Alliance headquarters of Aleman.</p>
<p>Like the election observers, Aleman's supporters saw little wrong with the vote. Considering their victory a triumph of the populist right, Aleman's working-class voters danced to brass bands until well into Monday night.</p>
<p>Aleman played down Ortega's charge, saying he hoped the Sandinistas would end up backing him. &quot;I hope that Comandante Ortega has matured,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the Sandinistas have accused Aleman of being backed by supporters of Anastasio Somoza, the dictator they ousted in 1979. They are not likely to be easily wooed.</p>
<p>Ortega, a former revolutionary who admits he made mistakes as Nicaragua's president, says he is a different man now who, on losing at the ballot box in 1990, gave up power graciously.</p>
<p>His own supporters were angry, however, and demanded that the vote be annulled. Their leader's charge raised fears of a backlash by the Sandinista's still-mighty grassroots networks.</p>
<p>&quot;I ask that these elections be annulled because they are a mess,&quot; weeping Ortega supporter Ana Correa said on television.</p>
<p>The first victim of the standoff was the hope for a quick national reconciliation, a key campaign pledge of both candidates that is considered crucial in stopping a slide back to the ideological conflicts of Nicaragua's past.</p>
<p>Reconciliation was never given much of a chance, taking into account Nicaragua's long history of political violence.</p>
<p>Each side demonised the other during the election campaign, the Sandinistas playing up Aleman's links to the oppressive Somoza dynasty, and Aleman calling Ortega a closet Marxist thinly disguised as a social democrat.</p>
