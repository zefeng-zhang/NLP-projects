<p>Engineering concern BBA Group Plc unveiled a 19 percent leap in six month pretax pre-exceptional profits on Wednesday, fuelled by continued expansion growth.</p>
<p>BBA saw profits for the first half of 1996 rise to 72.1 million stg, with the interim dividend at 2.1 pence per share, up from 1.8.</p>
<p>Turnover was up 24 percent for continuing operations at 552.4 million stg, flattered by acquisition sales. Stripping that out, factor sales were up five percent at 469 million stg.  </p>
<p>In a divisional breakdown, BBA said transportation's friction unit had enjoyed a good period in the face of tough market conditions in Germany.</p>
<p>The unit is seen benefiting from its investment programme and further efficiency gains later in the year.</p>
<p>New business came from car-makers including and Nissan.</p>
<p>The U.S. arm also continued to expand, with plant capacity set to double to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>The UK landing gear business had a good first half, together with the Texstars aircraft canopy unit.  </p>
<p>Both divisions returned to profit and are set to continue to benefit from the upturn in aerospace.</p>
<p>In the industrial sector of the group, non-woven products performed in line with forecasts, with operating margins and market shares improving.</p>
<p>The filtration business is seen affording more growth potential this year. This, plus sound sales and the easing of raw material costs pointed to encouraging prospects ahead.</p>
<p>The specialist electrical business saw profits and sales move ahead, with the order book looking strong and increasing penetration in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
