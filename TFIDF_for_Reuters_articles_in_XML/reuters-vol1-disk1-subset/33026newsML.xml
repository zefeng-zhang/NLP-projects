<p>Syria expects to more than double its proven oil and gas reserves when structures believed to contain oil and gas are drilled, a senior oil official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Seismic, gravity, magnetic, electro-magnatic, remote sensing pictures and geological survey enabled us to discover prosperous surface and sub-surface structures but so far only 293 were drilled and about 160 gave oil and gas production,&quot; Hussein Makarem of the Syrian Petroleum Company (SPC) said.</p>
<p>&quot;The structures are considered as important as the other structures where oil was found with good quanities,&quot; he said, speaking at a seminar on geological activities.</p>
<p>Makarem said that several international oil companies were negotiating to obtain exploration licences in Syria.</p>
<p>He gave no figures, but according to recent estimates Syria had around 2.5 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 7,000 billion cubic feet of gas.</p>
<p>&quot;In the prosperous structures we expect the existance (of) double the discovered oil reserves and more than double the gas reserves.. This means the oil industry in Syria has a bright future,&quot; Makarem said.</p>
<p>But he said that confirmation of that would require detailed studies and large investment over several years.</p>
<p>Makarem said that since the begining of production in 1967 until early this year Syria's total production of oil reached 338 million cubic metres (2.436 billion barrels).</p>
<p>Production of gas of all types during the same period reached 39.5 billion cubic metres (1394 billion cubic feet).</p>
<p>Makarem said that in 1968 Syria's production of mainly heavy oil in the far north-eastern fields stood at 1.13 million cubic metres per year (8.16 million bpd).</p>
<p>Production rose to 8.8 million cubic metres per year (150,000 bpd by 1995, he said.</p>
<p>Starting from 1985 Syria began production of light oil from oilfields in central Syria extending to the eastern parts of the country, close to the Iraqi border, with a rate of 500,000 cubic metres per year (3.4 million barrels per year).</p>
<p>This developed later to reach 20 million cubic metres (125.6 million barrels per year) in 1995.</p>
<p>Syria currently produces around an avarage 600,000 barrels per day of which over 330,000 bpd are exported</p>
