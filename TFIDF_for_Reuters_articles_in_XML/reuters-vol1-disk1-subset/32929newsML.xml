<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Shares held on to Dow-inspired gains but closed just off the day's worst levels awaiting news on UK interest rates and amid weakness in the United States. The FTSE 100 index finished 16.8 points up on the day, at 3,872.7.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's blue chip DAX index gained nearly 1 percent in bourse trade amid relief at the mild global market response to the Iraqi crisis. The 30-share DAX closed up 21.62 points at 2,532.39 following the turnaround which sent Wall Street to a higher close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>PARIS - Stocks finished higher in a technical rebound helped by strong results at blue-chip energy group Total. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 13.34 points, or 0.68 percent, at 1,984.77.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares ended on a higher note, but below the day's highs, on moderate volumes. Trading was dominated by Roche securities. The all-share Swiss Performance Index was up 7.46 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,335.24.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed mixed and brokers said the impact of the second U.S. missile attack on Iraq was marginal, although the news initially jolted the market and pulled the Nikkei average down close to its key 20,000 level in late morning. The 225-share Nikkei average closed 3.72 points or 0.02 percent higher at 20,201.87.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks rebounded, regaining most of Tuesday's losses on the U.S. missile attack on Iraq, as investors believed the conflict would not escalate and impact on corporate earnings. The Hang Seng Index advanced 119.77 points or 1.09 percent to close at 11,076.95.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The share market closed on a strong note as the bond market climbed off the floor after Tuesday's solid selloff. The All Ordinaries index rose 13.9 points to 2,258.5.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial shares ended firm in brisk trade amid heavy volumes, bouyed by futures-related activity. Golds ended easier, dragged down by a softer bullion price. The overall index gained 66.8 points to 6,771.9 points, the industrial index rose 84.7 points to 7,943.6 points and the gold index slipped 4.0 points to 1,802.3 points.</p>
