<p>A red-faced French President Jacques Chirac, teeth clenched and elbows flailing, snapped a sharp command to omnipresent Israeli security men during a visit to Jerusalem's Old City on Tuesday: &quot;Go away&quot;.</p>
<p>They ignored the presidential decree, drawing a complaint from the ruffled French leader to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who apologised for any overzealousness in trying &quot;to protect a friend&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is provocation. Stop this now. Do you want me to go back to my plane and go home to France?&quot; Chirac protested in English to the head of security.</p>
<p>For Chirac, it was his first taste of the kind of all-embracing protection that has been in force in Israel for local and visiting foreign leaders since prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Jew almost a year ago.</p>
<p>He did not want it and he did not like it.</p>
<p>&quot;The president very specifically requested light security,&quot; Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told reporters.</p>
<p>She said &quot;the behaviour of Israeli security forces caused unacceptable agitation&quot;.</p>
<p>Meeting Chirac later in the day, Netanyahu told reporters: &quot;I want first of all to apologise for what happened this morning. President Chirac told me what happened...We did that for a good cause, to protect a friend.</p>
<p>&quot;What we did in the Old City, I have to tell you, the security people do to me. They keep me as a very tight prisoner,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;I explained that since the Rabin murder, our security officials are extremely strict about protecting public figures.&quot;</p>
<p>During the walking tour of the walled Old City, security men wrestled journalists away from Chirac's party and armed border guards stood poised outside each Palestinian shop as he blew kisses to on-lookers and eventually blew a fuse.</p>
<p>Reaching the entrance to Haram al-Sharif, the site of Islam's third holiest shrine, Chirac had had enough.</p>
<p>&quot;No security now. I don't want you. Go away. You have no business here,&quot; he told stern-faced Israeli guards.</p>
<p>The French leader tried to push them away from the gate to the compound but the security men would not be moved and accompanied him on to the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount.</p>
<p>Earlier, dozens of Israeli guards surrounded Chirac as he entered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, traditional burial place of Jesus.</p>
<p>At St Anne's Church, granted to Napoleon III in 1856 by the Ottoman empire, Chirac referred to the security burden he had to bear on the Via Dolorosa -- the route tradition says Jesus took on the way to his crucifixion.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not been without difficulty,&quot; Chirac told Christian clergy and Palestinian Christians.</p>
<p>Chirac stood outside St Anne's, officially French territory, for 10 minutes while his aides negotiated the departure from the church of Israeli police. Eventually a side door opened, the police left and Chirac agreed to go inside.</p>
<p>Addressing the issue of Jerusalem, he said: &quot;This city must remain open -- open to the Christians of Palestine and to the Christians of the world. Open to all religions.&quot;</p>
<p>He also visited the Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest site, along with French Jewish leaders.</p>
<p>Chirac had turned down an Old City tour with the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, assserting France's view that the international community does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem, including the Old City, annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Daniel Saada, spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Paris who was in Israel for the Chirac visit, expressed anger the French leader was accompanied on the Jerusalem tour by Leila Shahid, the PLO's ambassador to France.</p>
<p>&quot;Inviting the PLO representative as if she were the ambassador of this 'country' of Jerusalem to accompany him enraged us,&quot; Saada told Reuters.</p>
