<p>San Antonio Spurs All-Star centre David Robinson, who has never had a serious injury in his career, will be sidelined for the next two to four weeks with back problems, the team revealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Robinson and forward Chuck Person both had their backs examined by specialists Monday at a Los Angeles clinic. Person will have surgery next Tuesday and is expected to be out at least three to six months.</p>
<p>Robinson, the 1995 NBA Most Valuable Player who has led the Spurs to consecutive Midwest Division titles, has played just one of five exhibition games. He will miss the start of the season and may not return until the end of November.</p>
<p>&quot;David Robinson will return to Los Angeles for about a five-day period to begin rehabilitation of his back,&quot; said Spurs general manager Gregg Popovich. &quot;The current problem does not indicate that surgery is necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>A team spokesman described the injury as a lower back strain, adding that Robinson has experienced back pain for the last couple of years and arrived at training camp in October with lingering pain.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Robinson is among the league's premier centres. He averaged 25 points, 12.2 rebounds and 3.4 blocks per game last season, his seventh in the league.</p>
<p>Outside of a torn ligament in his left hand that forced him to miss the final 14 games of the 1991-92 season, Robinson has missed just three games in his career.</p>
<p>Robinson's injury would force Will Perdue into the starting lineup. The Spurs traded Dennis Rodman to Chicago in 1995 for Perdue, who played mostly at power forward last season, averaging 5.2 points and 6.1 rebounds per game.</p>
