<p>German driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen was named on Wednesday as the replacement for current Grand Prix leader Damon Hill in the Williams Formula One team next season.</p>
<p>Briton Hill, who has been with Williams for the past six years, could clinch the drivers' title in Sunday's Italian Grand Prix at Monza.</p>
<p>A statement from Williams on Wednesday said Frentzen, 29, would join Canadian driver Jacques Villeneuve next year.</p>
<p>Hill was dropped from the Williams' team after contract negotiations broke down last week and he now looks likely to move to the British Jordan team.</p>
<p>Frentzen, now with Sauber, has not won a Grand Prix, but is regarded as one of the fastest drivers on the circuit.</p>
<p>&quot;Damon has contributed greatly to the team both as a test and a race driver,&quot; Williams team director Frank Williams said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think his record speaks for itself as very few drivers have ever approached his record of 20 wins in 64 starts.&quot;</p>
