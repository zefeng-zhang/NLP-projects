<title>INDONESIA: Hearings held in Jakarta riot trials.</title>
<headline>Hearings held in Jakarta riot trials.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>An Indonesian court held preliminary hearings on Monday in five of 10 separate trials of 124 people facing charges related to July 27 riots in Jakarta, court officials said.</p>
<p>Budiman, clerk of the court for criminal matters at the Central Jakarta State Court, told Reuters 60 of the accused were present in court for the hearings.</p>
<p>All the accused are supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Indonesian founding father Sukarno. They were arrested after their occupation of Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) headquarters in Jakarta -- aimed at protesting Megawati's removal as PDI leader -- ended with a police raid on July 27.</p>
<p>The accused are charged with assault and disobeying police orders to disperse after they were thrown out of the headquarters.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the court adjourned the hearings for one week after opening statements were heard and the defence filed a routine request for the cases to be dismissed.</p>
<p>The remaining 64 accused, whose preliminary hearings were on October 9, return to court Wednesday to hear whether the judges in their cases have accepted defence arguments to drop proceedings because of legal flaws in the prosecution's case.</p>
<p>&quot;If the (arguments) are accepted, then the cases are finished, but if they are refused, then evidence-taking will begin,&quot; Budiman said.</p>
<p>&quot;If evidence-taking begins, we do not yet know how many witnesses will be called and we cannot estimate how long it (the trial) will take,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers have said the cases, in which the accused face maximum nine-year jail sentences, could take two months to be heard.</p>
<p>The official National Commission on Human Rights in a report this month criticized the seizure of the building by police -- aided by supporters of Megawati's factional opponents -- as causing the widespread rioting which followed, killing five people.</p>
<p>The rioting was the worst violence in the city in over two decades.</p>
