<p>British fund management watchdog IMRO, thrust into the limelight by two high profile cases in the last week, expects to see more significant disciplinary action before the year is out, said chief executive Phillip Thorpe.</p>
<p>The organisation is also streamlining its investigative operations by bringing monitoring and enforcement teams closer.</p>
<p>Chief executive of IMRO (Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) Phillip Thorpe told Reuters on Tuesday that more disciplinary action has recently been authorised, but stressed that the watchdog had not launched an aggressive new campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a raft of investigations running... There will I'm sure be further discipline coming through during the course of the year and some of it will be significant,&quot; said Thorpe.</p>
<p>Robert Fleming group was punished last Thursday for rule breaches, suffering fines totalling 700,000 pounds, after a five month investigation into dealing procedures at subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The action against Fleming included Hong Kong authorities securing voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million from a company jointly owned by Jardine Matheson and Fleming.</p>
<p>Last week also saw IMRO fine Save &amp; Prosper Equity Plan Managers 115,000 pounds for breaches of rules relating to its personal equity plans (PEPs) invested directly in equities.</p>
<p>Then on Monday, the watchdog began a probe into possible irregularities at Morgan Grenfell after the fund management arm of investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell suspended dealing in three high-profile European funds.</p>
<p>As at the end of June, IMRO was conducting 51 investigations and three disciplinary actions were in progress. Whilst some of the disciplinary actions have been concluded, the total number of these has since that date increased, Thorpe said.</p>
<p>IMRO is also streamlining operations, enabling it to work more effectively. Thorpe said that within the last two weeks it has restructured so that the separate monitoring and enforcement teams report now to the same director, Dan Waters.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty much an efficiency change. What this will allow is an easier migration between monitoring and enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel Gouveia-Lima, who was director of the 70 strong monitoring team, left IMRO quietly about a fortnight ago.</p>
<p>But then, headline grabbing is not the watchdog's style. The last week has been an aberration, with two major European investment banking organisations at the centre of IMRO action.</p>
<p>Thorpe stressed on Tuesday that the timing of Fleming and Morgan Grenfell was entirely coincidental. Fleming was the culmination of months of investigation, while Morgan Grenfell has only just come to IMRO's attention.</p>
<p>He said that much of the watchdog's time is spent working with the industry to ensure compliance. Last month, it started a pilot scheme, under which around 50 firms have taken the regulatory burden on themselves for 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Despite the threat to investors in the three Morgan Grenfell funds that their overall valuations may be cut, the industry is confident of weathering the recent spate of embarrassing news.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe that many people, whether institutions or individuals, are rushing around saying we must take our money away from Morgan Grenfell, Flemings, or anyone else,&quot; said Stephen Tanner of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association.</p>
