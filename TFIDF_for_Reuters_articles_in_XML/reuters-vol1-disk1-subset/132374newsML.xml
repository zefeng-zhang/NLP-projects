<headline>FPC launches technical review of Fla. nuke.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Florida Power Corp said on Tuesday it has extended an outage at its Crystal River 3 nuclear power plant to review the 19-year old plant's design and equipment operations.</p>
<p>The 860 megawatt plant, in Red Level, Fla., was shut Sept 2 to repair a lubricating oil pipeline to the unit's main turbine generator.</p>
<p>&quot;While the unit was off line for unrelated maintenance, FPC found several design basis issues that require further study,&quot; the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The company said it also planned to &quot;analyze equipment operating margins&quot; during the extended outage.</p>
<p>&quot;The key issues involve the potential capacity of an emergency diesel generator and piping concerns in the emergency feedwater system,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Citing the extent of the evaluation and anticipated regulatory consultations, the company said it did not expect to restart the plant before the end of the year.</p>
<p>This supported the Daily Status Report issued on Monday by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which said the plant likely would not return to service until January, 1997.</p>
<p>FPC said it anticipates no problems serving customer load requirements over the autumn since it typically is a season of low electricity demand. Any need for extra power can be met through purchases from outside power suppliers, it added.</p>
<p>FPC is the main subsidiary of St. Petersburg-based Florida Progress Corp and serves 1.3 million customers in central and northern Florida.</p>
