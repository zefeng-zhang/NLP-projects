<p>Diamond giant De Beers said on Wednesday it saw a sparkling future for its Orapa mine in Botswana, already one of the world's longest-mined diamond reserves, but destined for a steep jump in output.</p>
<p>The company plans to more than double throughput at Orapa, lifting output to around 11.5 million carats a year by 2000 from 5.5 million in 1995, at a cost of 1.3 billion South African rand ($290 million).</p>
<p>That will lift De Beers' total Botswanan output by around a third to some 23 million carats, prodviding a major boost to the Botswanan economy which relies on diamonds for 80 percent of its foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>The effect of the expansion will be to halve the life of the open pit mine at Orapa from 60 years to 31 years.</p>
<p>But De Beers officials said the diamond-containing kimberlite pipe had been proved to extend 200 metres below the surface, holding out the possibility of lucrative underground workings in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an extremely long future ahead of us. Orapa and (neighbouring) Letlhakane are large producers and are going to get larger,&quot; mine manager Simon Webb told visiting reporters.</p>
<p>Orapa and Letlhakane, together with a third diamond mine at Jwaneng, are all operated by De Beers through Debswana, in which it has an equal partnership with the Botswanan government.</p>
<p>Debswana's diamond production, mostly of gemstone quality, was 16.8 million carats in 1995 with Jwaneng contributing 10.5 million carats and Letlhakane 0.9 million.</p>
<p>The Orapa mine, begun 25 years ago, is already one of world's oldest.</p>
<p>But Webb said there were still vast untapped riches with test drills suggesting the kimberlite reserve ran as much as 600 metres below the surface before splitting into two pipes, each of 20 hectares.</p>
<p>The Orapa pit currently measures 1.5 kilometres by 900 metres. After expansion, it will be 2.1 km by 1.6 km.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the most unbelievable deposit -- it is out of this world,&quot; said Webb.</p>
<p>Orapa's processing plant, which now handles 7.9 million tonnes of material a year, will be upgraded to 8.9 million tonnes by the end of 1996. After that a new plant of the same size will be added.</p>
<p>Webb said Orapa's average grade was currently 67 carats a tonne, although this ratio could decrease gradually in the future as the mine goes deeper.</p>
<p>Last month De Beers announced it had reached agreement with the Botswana government on a 21-year renewal of the lease for Orapa.</p>
<p>Agreement was also recently reached on a sales contract for a further five years effective January 1996, under which all of Debswana's diamond production would continue to be marketed through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation (CSO).</p>
<p>De Beers sells about 75 percent of the world's rough diamond production through the CSO, which posted record diamond sales of $2.75 billion in the first six months of 1996.</p>
