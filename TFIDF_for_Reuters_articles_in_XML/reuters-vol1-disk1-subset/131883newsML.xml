<p>Australian Opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans added his support on Monday to plans to oust independent politician Pauline Hanson, saying she was not making a positive contribution to parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see her out of politics altogether, and I think by the time the next election comes the Australian electorate will be intelligent enough to realise she's making no positive contribution whatsoever,&quot; Evans told reporters.</p>
<p>Media reports said Liberal and Labor Party powerbrokers forged a deal over the weekend under which both parties would direct their preferences to each other at the next election.</p>
<p>Asked if the move would push Hanson into the Senate, Evans said: &quot;We've got so many problems in the Senate, I don't think it could make them any worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Hanson sparked outrage from both major parties when she used her first speech to parliament in September to proclaim that Australia was being &quot;swamped by Asians&quot; and called for an end to immigration and aboriginal aid programmes.</p>
