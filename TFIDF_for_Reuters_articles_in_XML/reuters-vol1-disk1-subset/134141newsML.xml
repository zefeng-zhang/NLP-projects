<p>Finnish chemicals group Kemira Oy said on Tuesday its issue of shares and the sale of part of the government's stake in the company had been oversubscribed and priced at 49.50 markka.</p>
<p>&quot;The price was 49.50,&quot; Kemira CEO Heimo Karinen told Reuters. &quot;I don't have the final figures yet, but it was about two times (oversubscribed),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He was referring both to Kemira's issue of five million new shares and the state's sale of 12 million shares to institutions. The issue was priced at the end of book-building. Kemira's stock ended official hours at 51.50 markka, up 0.50.  </p>
<p>He said lead manager Goldman Sachs had yet to decide whether to exercise an option to increase the issue of new shares by three million.</p>
<p>&quot;The price is good,&quot; Karinen said. &quot;The two-times oversubscription shows it was not too high, but not too low either.&quot;</p>
<p>The state, which currently plans to sell an extra four million shares through a bonus offering to private investors, could also increase this by two million more but that decision will depend on how the offering goes, Kemira said.</p>
<p>In the offering to private investors, which opened on Tuesday at the same price as the institutional issue, investors can receive one free Kemira share from the state for each 10 they buy as long as they hold the stock for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>The state's holding in Kemira is due to fall to about 57 percent from 73 percent now.</p>
