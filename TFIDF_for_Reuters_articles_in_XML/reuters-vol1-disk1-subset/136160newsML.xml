<p>Stratus Computer Inc said that its software business was a positive contributor to earnings for the first time this year, as the benefits of its recent restructuring began to take effect.</p>
<p>&quot;With a sharpened focus on the best opportunities, we expect that results will continue to improve in this part of our business,&quot; said Bill Foster, chairman and CEO, in a statement. Stratus restructured its software unit in Q2.</p>
<p>Stratus reported third quarter earnings of $0.45 a share, versus a loss of $0.40 a share a year ago. According to First Call, the Wall Street consensus was $0.42 a share.  </p>
<p>Stratus also said that its hardware product revenues were up 15 percent on a sequential basis and that they were up five percent versus the year-ago period.  It said its Continuum Series 400 computer family saw strong sales growth.</p>
<p>It said it expects even stronger Continuum growth in the fourth quarter, when Hewlett-Packard Co's UNIX operating system is available for the system, which is designed around  H-P's PA/RISC processor technology.  Stratus develops so-called fault-tolerant computers specifically designed with a backup system in case of system failures.</p>
