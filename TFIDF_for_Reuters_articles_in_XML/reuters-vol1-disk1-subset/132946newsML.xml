<title>UK: NWE fuel oil - HS thin, barges down on slow demand.</title>
<headline>NWE fuel oil - HS thin, barges down on slow demand.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fuel oil was steady in NWE with the Mediterranean showing only slightly higher trading activity.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel barges were knocked lower on Tuesday with $123 and $124 fob ARA traded from Monday's $127-128.</p>
<p>&quot;There has not been enough bunker demand to keep prices firm. It is very quiet,&quot; said one barge trader. Dealers said prices could still recover if shipper enquiries pick up tomorrow although there was seen to be some pressure to shift material before November.</p>
<p>High sulphur cracked cargoes were still balanced, but no trade was heard and prices looked steady at $116-118 fob NWE.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was thinly offered set against muted interest. &quot;People want to buy, but they are not desparate yet,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>Low sulphur material was looking less bullish.&quot;You can't sell the stuff,&quot; said one trader. Prices were steady to softer with the continued absence of the main Med buyer until around November 10 because of port congestion. Offers were at $137.50 cif Italy, in line with current swaps numbers.</p>
