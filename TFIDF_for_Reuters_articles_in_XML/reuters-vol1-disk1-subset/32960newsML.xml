<p>The Egyptian government, keeping up the accelerated pace of its privatisation campaign, plans to offer shares in two state companies for sale every week for the rest of the year, the minister in charge said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The pace will slacken a little next year, to an average of three companies offered every fortnight, Public Enterprise Atef Obeid told a conference on investment in Egypt.</p>
<p>&quot;The target for the rest of the year is one company a week through the stock exchange and one company a week offered for direct sale,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year it will be one company a week (through the stock exchange) and one company every 15 days to be sold direct.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a programme would cover about 100 of the 314 public-sector companies originally owned by Obeid's ministry, compared to about two dozen companies privatised in whole or in part since privatisation began in 1993.</p>
<p>The minister did not give targets for the value of the assets to be sold or say how large a stake the state would sell. In recent privatisations it has tended to offer less than 50 percent and sell more than 50 percent if demand is sufficient.</p>
<p>The programme stagnated for the first four months of this year but gathered pace in May after the government decided to relinquish control of Medinet Nasr Housing and Development.</p>
<p>All subsequent offers have been heavily oversubscribed and the all-share index has risen 15 percent on a wave of optimism.</p>
<p>On Wednesday government newspapers quoted Obeid as saying the state's Holding Company for Mining and Refractories had agreed to offer for sale large stakes in Egyptian Tora Portland Cement and Nasr Glass and Crystal Company.</p>
<p>Gabr Sadiq, financial manager of Tora Cement, was quoted as saying up to 30 percent of the company's shares would be sold to one major investor. Some 32.5 percent of the shares in Tora Cement were sold to the private sector earlier this year.</p>
<p>Tora Cement made a net profit of 120 million pounds ($35 million) in the year 1995/96, which ended on June 30.</p>
<p>The holding company is seeking an anchor investor to buy all (corrects from 'up to 51 percent') the equity in Nasr Glass and Crystal and then put in more money to bring in new technology, Obeid said.</p>
