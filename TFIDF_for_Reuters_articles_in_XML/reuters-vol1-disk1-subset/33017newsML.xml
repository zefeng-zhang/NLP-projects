<p>PLO officials said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat would meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time on Wednesday. But Netanyahu's spokesman said no meeting had been set.</p>
<p>Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority, told Reuters: &quot;The meeting will take place soon.&quot; Chief PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, asked when a summit would be held, advised reporters: &quot;Go to Erez,&quot; the Israeli-Gaza crossing point where a summit could take place.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for Netanyahu said no meeting had been set. He said any announcement would come from the prime minister's office.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been struggling over the past week to find a formula that would enable the men to meet and for full-fledged peace talks to resume.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May on a pledge not to swap occupied Arab land for peace, had said originally he preferred not to meet Arafat but softened his position in recent days.</p>
<p>Palestinians have been pressing for a summit and resumed talks to tackle the issue of Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
