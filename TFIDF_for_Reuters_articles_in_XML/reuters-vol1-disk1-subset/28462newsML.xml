<p>Magna Group Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Homeland Bankshares Corp., the second-largest banking company in Iowa, for about $216 million, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>St. Louis-based Magna will issue 5 million shares of its common stock and pay $92 million in cash in exchange for all theoutstanding Homeland common shares. Homeland shareholders may choose to exchange each of their shares for either about 1.55 Magna shares, a comparable amount in cash or a combination.</p>
<p>Magna said it will repurchase about 600,000 shares of the stock, under its current repurchase plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly will consider buy back programmes beyond that, but nothing has been approved beyond that,&quot; G. Thomas Andes, Magna chairman, said in a news conference.</p>
<p>Waterloo, Iowa-based Homeland, with assets of $1.2 billion as of June 30, owns and operates four commercial banks and one savings bank and provides financial services through a network of 33 locations in Iowa.</p>
<p>Magna, with $5.35 billion in assets, is the third-largest banking institution in the St. Louis metropolitan area and the nation's 95th largest banking company. It has 106 banking locations throughout Illinois and Missouri and a trust and brokerage company.</p>
<p>After the acquisition, Magna would have about 55 percent of its assets in Illinois, 25 percent in Missouri and 20 percent in Iowa, Andes said.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to approval by Homeland shareholders and regulators.</p>
<p>Magna said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings within 12 months, and save about $8 million through centralization of systems and procedures.</p>
<p>Some of the cost savings will come from job cuts, though those cuts could come from attrition, Andes said.</p>
<p>Homeland Chief Executive Erl Schmiesing said during the news conference that cuts were underway at Homeland in any case as it consolidated.</p>
<p>Magna will continue to consider other acqusitions, possibly in Iowa, Andes said.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly like the state of Iowa,&quot; he said. &quot;We would certainly welcome the opportunity to expand in the state of Iowa, as well as Illinois and Missouri.&quot;</p>
<p>Magna is also among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets, a perception that did not change with the Homeland acquisition announcment.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate,&quot; said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray.</p>
<p>Homeland's stock rose $1.75 to $35.75, while Magna edged down 6.25 cents to $24.81 Tuesday on Nasdaq.</p>
