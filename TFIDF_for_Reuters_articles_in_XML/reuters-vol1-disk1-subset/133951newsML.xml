<p>Lili was no threat to land on Tuesday as it spun in the open Atlantic east of Bermuda, but the weather system retained enough strength to be classified as a hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre said.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the centre of Hurricane Lili was near latitude 33.3 north and longitude 54.1 west, or about 600 miles (985 km) east of Bermuda and moving southeast at about seven mph (11 kph). Forecasters said the storm was expected to turn eastward during the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Lili's maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph (120 kph), making the storm a weak hurricane, and it was expected to lose strength and turn extratropical within the next day or so and become a winter storm.</p>
<p>Lili bypassed Bermuda on Sunday, sparing the British colony the worst of its winds and rain after a rampage that began last week off the coast of Central America.</p>
<p>Flooding from the storm was blamed for 10 deaths in Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica before it moved north over Cuba, where it caused extensive damage to agriculture, before moving east through the central Bahamas.</p>
<p>The Cuban government said the storm destroyed almost all crops in eight of the country's 14 provinces when it swept through western and central Cuba on Thursday night and Friday.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, meeting the diplomatic corps in Havana to give details of the damage, said every single banana plantation was damaged in the affected area.</p>
<p>He said in a statement that some 1.62 million acres (656,138 hectares) of sugar cane had been affected. Sugar is a key foreign exchange earner for the Communist-ruled island and the crop is due to be harvest in just two or three months' time.</p>
<p>No casualties were reported, but the storm was a severe blow to Cuba at a time when the Caribbean nation is struggling to emerge from a five-year economic crisis caused by the collapse of its old economic partner, the former Soviet Union.</p>
