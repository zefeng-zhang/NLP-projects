<p>Leading British and German shares climbed to new peaks early on Monday after a sharp rise in New York stocks took the Dow to its 31st record high of the year on Friday.</p>
<p>And on the currency markets, the dollar set a fresh 33-month high against the yen after Sunday's general election in Japan did little to alter expectations of a continuing easy money policy there.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Japanese stocks slid sharply while government bonds surged to a record high after the poll, which left the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) without a clear majority.</p>
<p>The London Stock Exchange's blue chip FTSE 100 index hit 4,064.1 in early trading, a rise of 11.0 points beating its previous best of 4,063.2 set on October 15. Later it dropped back slightly but remained in positive territory.</p>
<p>While it appeared the ninth anniversary of the 1987 &quot;Black Monday&quot; crash was passing off relatively quietly, many still remained nervous that corrections in both the British and U.S. markets were overdue.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing follow-through from Friday and the market's still fairly frothy. Dealers are saying we're going better but don't be too assured about it. There are one or two things lurking in the background,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>German shares also jumped to new record high, boosted by Wall Street and after news that September M3 money supply growth, the Bundesbank's key policy indicator, had slowed down.</p>
<p>The data was in line with market expectations and analysts said the slowdown, while reassuring, would not prompt the Bundesbank to nudge interest rates lower again in the near term.</p>
<p>The 30-share IBIS DAX index rose 15.91 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,743.47 in pre-bourse electronic trading. Its previous peak was 2739.42, hit on 18 October. Later floor trading opened slightly weaker however and the DAX index was down 6.73 points at 2734.29 by 0915 gmt.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse was less bullish with stocks trading flat after a slightly firmer opening. Dealers said the market was being affected by profit-taking.</p>
<p>By 0915gmt the dollar was trading 112.79 yen -- just below its 33-month high of 112.86 yen set in early Europe. Against the mark it was at 1.5415 off slightly from an early high of 1.5435.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Japanese election result meant it was most likely the government would go ahead with planned sales tax rises in April and modest fiscal tightening would allow the central bank to keep interest rates low.</p>
<p>&quot;The net effect of the polls seems to be that there is really no change at all and a continuation of existing policies will remain yen negative,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita underlined the current low interest rate policy when he told a meeting of the BOJ's regional branch managers that monetary policy was aimed at securing a solid base for economic recovery.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0915 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 112.79 yen and 1.5415 marks compared with Friday's London close of 112.59 yen and 1.5431 marks.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0915 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was up 5.2 at 4058.3</p>
<p>Frankfurt's IBIS DAX index of electronic trading was up 6.73 at 2734.29.</p>
<p>The DAX index of floor trading was down 2.74 at 2732.08.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold opened in Europe at $380.0 an ounce on Monday, slightly off Friday's $380.15 London close. Silver started at $4.90.</p>
