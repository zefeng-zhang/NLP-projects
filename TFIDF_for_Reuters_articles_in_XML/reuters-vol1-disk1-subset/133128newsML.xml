<p>Vytautas Landsbergis, who led Lithuania in its 1990-91 drive for independence, began preparations for a coalition government on Tuesday after beating his ex-communist foes in a general election.</p>
<p>Landsbergis and his Homeland Union party were well on top after a first round of elections, unseating the former Communists of the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP) in a sweet revenge for defeat at the polls in 1992.</p>
<p>Preliminary data showed the party is also set to do well in the second round of elections set for November 10.</p>
<p>Landsbergis, a short, stocky former music professor was the unlikely leader of the Baltic state's dramatic bid for independence from the former Soviet Union but was dumped at the polls by a population wearied by economic collapse.</p>
<p>With 1,726 of 2,037 voting districts counted, the Homeland Union had taken 29 percent of the first round vote. The former Communists were third at just over eight.</p>
<p>Landsbergis named Gediminas Vagnorius as candidate for prime minister, a post he occupied in 1991-92. They will probably have to form a coalition for a majority in the 141-seat parliament.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Homeland Union said informal talks had taken place at parliament but concrete issues would only be discussed after the second round.</p>
<p>&quot;The Homeland Union majority is quite large and it seems they (possible partners) will agree with Vagnorius as prime minister but that also depends on the president,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union has already said it will work with the Christian Democrats, running second at 10.28 percent. Analysts say the two may also invite the Centre Union, fourth on 8.15.</p>
<p>The first round of the vote decided 70 of the 141 seats in parliament but the remaining 71 seats are decided on a majority vote from a second round run-off.</p>
<p>Preliminary data from first round votes showed the Homeland Union has a good chance of beating the LDLP's 60 seats in the current parliament.</p>
<p>Landsbergis won admiration for himself and his people by standing up to Moscow, especially after 13 people were killed by Soviet troops on an attack on Vilnius television tower, protected by ordinary people behind makeshift barricades.</p>
<p>But his popularity plunged when the economy collapsed and the independence movement was riven by faction fighting. A humiliating electoral defeat in 1992 was compounded when Algirdas Brazauskas won the presidency in 1993.</p>
<p>Brazauskas, now without party affiliation, has formally to ask the new prime minister to form a government and is expected to go along with the wish of the majority in parliament.</p>
<p>But some right-wingers suspect he will try and help the LDLP maintain some influence, especially as he and Vagnorius dislike each other.</p>
