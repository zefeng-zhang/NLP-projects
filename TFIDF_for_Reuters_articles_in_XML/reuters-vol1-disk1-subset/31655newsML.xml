<p>Polish shares fell for the second session running and analysts said Wednesday's higher turnover which accompanied the unexpected fall and strong selling after price fixing signalled they could enter a correction phase.</p>
<p>Some analysts said that despite earlier expectations of a possible testing the July 5 high of 14,282.2 of the WIG index, the market could fall to 13,000 points in profit-taking correction after the 11.6 percent rise since mid-August.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's session shows that the market might enter a correction phase,&quot; said Ryszard Wojnowski, an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage.  </p>
<p>The WIG fell 0.6 percent, to 13,882.3 and turnover rose 8.9 percent to 110.3 million zlotys on both markets as a total of 48 issues fell, 15 rose and 14 were flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said the correction was likely to be brief and that the market might rise again and challenge the July 5 high. But they were divided whether it would keep on rising afterwards or fall.</p>
<p>Analysts expected the bourse to be influenced next week by investors speculative trade ahead of releases of companies' August earnings reports, due in mid-September.  </p>
<p>They were surprised by the garment maker Bytom's 10-percent surge in a 1.1-million zloty turnover.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover was at 0.8 million zlotys with BPH, the only stock trading, staying flat.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units rose 2.6 percent in a heavy 18.5-million zloty turnover in the single price auction system and rose 3.1 percent in a 2.1-million zloty continuous trade.</p>
