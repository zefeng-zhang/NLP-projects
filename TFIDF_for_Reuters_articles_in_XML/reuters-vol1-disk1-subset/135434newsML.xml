<title>MALAYSIA: Repco down after chief executive charged.</title>
<headline>Repco down after chief executive charged.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Repco Holdings Bhd fell sharply on Tuesday following news that its chief executive has been charged with a securities law violation, dealers said.</p>
<p>Shares of the timber and gaming firm were down 3.00 ringgit to 83, after falling as low as 80 ringgit earlier.</p>
<p>Choo Chin Thye pleaded not guilty on Monday to a charge under the Securities Industry Act of giving a misleading statement on January 27, 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that (the charge) is the main reason the stock is down,&quot; said one dealer, noting that other Second Board stocks were trading higher.</p>
<p>Choo's signature appears on a letter dated January 27, 1996 which was sent to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange outlining a profit forecast for the years ended June 30, 1996 and June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>The forecast was withdrawn a week later, and a lower projection was issued. Repco said in the revised letter that it had prematurely assumed approvals for a new gaming licence which were still pending.</p>
<p>Repco officials were not available for comment on Tuesday.</p>
