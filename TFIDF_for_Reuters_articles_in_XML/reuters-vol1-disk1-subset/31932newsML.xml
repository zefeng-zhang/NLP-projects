<p>China would pay a heavy price if it mishandled the reunification of Taiwan or Hong Kong and any mis-step would be exploited by its opponents, Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He also said the media would be there to assist Beijing's adversaries, who fear a strong China would upset the present world order.</p>
<p>&quot;If China mishandles Taiwan or Hong Kong the political and economic costs will be high,&quot; Lee told an international forum in the Chinese capital.</p>
<p>&quot;Any clumsy, high-handed or apparently brutal action can arouse resentment or fear in Hong Kong or Taiwan. Things can go wrong and provide an opening which (opponents) will exploit with the help of the media.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee, who resigned as Singapore's prime minister in 1990 and is now senior minister, said Beijing should assume groups in Asia and the West opposed it and would be glad to see it falter. He did not name anybody.</p>
<p>The forum on regional economic and political trends has drawn politicians and economic policymakers from China and abroad. China's Premier Li Peng gave the keynote speech but he was not in the audience when Lee made his remarks.</p>
<p>The British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Taiwan and China have been divided since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taiwan's leaders maintain they want to reunify with China but not on Beijing's terms.</p>
<p>China has come under sharp criticism from Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists, who fear Beijing will clamp down on various democratic freedoms, from speech to electoral politics, once it regains control.</p>
<p>Lee said Beijing should give protesters and dissidents time to adjust to the political changes after the transfer of power in Hong Kong. He said Taiwan could not become independent and he believed that the United States would not support this.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not possible for Taiwan to be independent against the will of a united and an economically strong China.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee added that China should avoid giving the United States or Europe reasons to supply Taiwan with more sophisticated weapons.</p>
<p>He also urged Beijing to publicly state what weapons it had in its arsenal and what it wanted to buy in order to allay fears of its neighbours.</p>
