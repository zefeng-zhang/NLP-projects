<p>Air New Zealand said difficult trading conditions had continued into the first two months of its new financial year and consequently the company's full-year profit was likely to be down on last year's NZ$225 million, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The company said in its prospectus for the previously announced issue of 121 million shares that earnings for the first half of the 1995/96 financial year were $135.1 million and in the second half earnings declined to $90.1 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;While trading in the first two months of the current financial year have been in keeping with last year's second-half performance, it is too early for directors to provide a reliable forecast in terms of the full-year outcome,&quot; Air New Zealand said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, assuming that the present difficult trading conditions continue to prevail, the directors expect that earnings for the full year will be below last year's $225 million&quot;.  </p>
<p>The prospectus said Air New Zealand had recently initiated a rigorous cost reduction programme to reflect the competitive conditions now prevailing &quot;which were expected to continue for the current year&quot;.</p>
<p>However, most cost reductions would not be booked until after the second half of the 1996/97 year.</p>
<p>The company noted that as a result of the recently announced purchase of 50 percent of Ansett Australia, Australia had become a very important market for the company.  </p>
<p>&quot;While Australia may provide stronger economic growth than is expected in New Zealand over the 1997 financial year, intense competition is expected to continue in the Australian domestic market,&quot; Air New Zealand said.</p>
<p>The purchase of the Ansett stake had recently been completed for a total of approximately $540 million. This was being financed by $350 million from existing cash reserves and $190 million of additional borrowing.</p>
<p>The proceeds of the offer of new shares are to be used for general operations and repayment of short-term debt. The offer is expected to raise $242 million.  </p>
