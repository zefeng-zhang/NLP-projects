<p>After the annual conferences of Britain's two main political parties, it looks clearer than ever that the coming general election will be fought on the personalities of their leaders rather than on their policies.</p>
<p>Although under Britain's cabinet system of government the prime minister is only first among equals, political analysts say convergence on issues of substance means voters will more than ever face a U.S.-style choice between two presidential-style candidates.</p>
<p>&quot;Plainly we are entering the most presidential election in British history. As ideas have merged, the people, and above all the leaders, are what matter,&quot; wrote political columnist Hugo Young in the Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p>The choice was plain for all to see at the conferences, carefully choreographed showcases that both main parties used as a springboard for the election, which must be held by May.</p>
<p>At Labour's conference earlier this month, party leader Tony Blair gave a visionary speech in which he vowed to fulfil a 10-point covenant with the British people to boost education and move people from welfare into work.</p>
<p>Supporters hailed it as an inspirational mission statement of a determined politician who knows exactly what changes he would make if Labour, some 20 percentage points ahead in opinion polls,  regains power after 17 years in opposition.</p>
<p>But detractors, including some newspapers, were unsettled by what they saw as the Messianic tone of Blair's speech.</p>
<p>This gave the ruling Conservatives a chance at their conference the following week to pitch Prime Minister John Major as a man of the people who had been tried and tested in power.</p>
<p>In contrast to Blair's rhetoric of missions and crusades, down-to-earth Major simply promised more of the same sensible, pragmatic management that he said had transformed Britain since the Conservatives took power in 1979.</p>
<p>To heighten the contrast, Major dwelt on his state school education and upbringing in two rooms in the run-down London suburb of Brixton and mocked the pampered luxury of Blair's private schooling in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>&quot;New Labour, old school tie,&quot; Major taunted.</p>
<p>Attacking the supposed middle-class elitism of Labour under Blair and its new, moderate leadership is a risky ploy: most of Major's ministers come from privileged social backgrounds.</p>
<p>But Conservative strategists are convinced from polling with focus groups of uncommitted voters that they are on to a winner by putting the spotlight on Major and &quot;marketing&quot; him as a champion of what he himself calls the &quot;hard-working classes&quot;.</p>
<p>Foreshadowing a head-to-head campaign with Blair, Major told supporters they would find him during the election in the middle of the crowd -- an echo of the 1992 election when he helped to confound poll predictions of a Conservative defeat by campaigning to great effect from an old-fashioned soapbox.</p>
<p>Blair's aides are equally confident that all this is a big mistake. They believe the Conservatives' judgment that Major is more popular than his party no longer holds true because of disenchantment with broken promises not to raise taxes.</p>
<p>Conservative-minded voters may be telling pollsters they believe Blair to be &quot;smarmy&quot; or &quot;phoney&quot;, but Labour says its research shows he is respected as a strong leader.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that Tony is, by streets, the most popular politician in Britain,&quot; a Blair aide said.</p>
<p>The focus on personalities may be inevitable in a television age, but opinions vary widely on whether it is a good thing.</p>
<p>The Scotsman newspaper regretted that a personality contest would smother the genuine differences that still exist between the parties on issues such as home rule for Scotland.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether or not the future prime minister of the country comes from privileged or humble origins is largely irrelevant,&quot; the paper commented.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americanisation of British politics has already given us the spin doctor, the soundbite and, in the past two weeks, the stage-managed political rally rather than the conference of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;Soon it will almost certainly offer us the first ever televised debate between the party leaders. Britain's own pale version of the presidential campaign is now with us,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Times, while warning that any descent into personal insults would offend the traditional decency of British politics, approved of the presidential trend.</p>
<p>&quot;This is fair game. The experience of the past two Tory leaders has illustrated how profoundly the character of prime ministers stamps itself upon the success or otherwise of their administrations,&quot; the paper said in an editorial.</p>
