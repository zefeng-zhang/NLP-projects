<p>A top Vietnamese general has warned that corruption is undermining confidence in Hanoi's communist leadership and called for tough measures to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Le Kha Phieu, a senior member of the ruling politburo, was quoted by the official Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Army) newspaper on Monday as saying corruption and other economic crimes were posing a threat to society.</p>
<p>&quot;Corruption has been causing the degeneration of the revolutionary nature of our State, and the reduction of confidence in the Party and the State by the working class and the people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact corruption is the ally of hostile forces who have plots to make us deviate from the road towards socialism.&quot;</p>
<p>Phieu's comments were made in a hard-hitting speech last week to members of Vietnam's Economic Police.</p>
<p>He said that, in addition to corruption, other crimes such as smuggling, trading in banned goods, and the misappropriation of state and private assets were also damaging the national economy.</p>
<p>Phieu said Vietnam's law forces needed to overcome &quot;shortcomings&quot; and deal with offenders strictly &quot;in spite of who they are and what position they are in.&quot;</p>
<p>Corruption is emerging as a major political issue in Vietnam and new cases have been reported in recent months on an almost daily basis by state media. Earlier this year, the communist-run country was named in a report by a Hong Kong-based consultancy group as one of the most corrupt in East Asia.</p>
