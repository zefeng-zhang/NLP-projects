<p>Cambodia is still seeking peace and democracy five years after warring factions agreed to lay down arms but the Asian nation has notched up political, social and economic gains, analysts and officials said.</p>
<p>The internal problems of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas could prove a major turning point for peace but risk polarising the political scene with rival parties seeking the loyalty of different rebel factions.</p>
<p>The problem is linked to a simmering row over power-sharing between the two leading ruling coalition parties, the royalist FUNCINPEC and the ex-communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP), and analysts believe the differences will resurface ahead of elections which must be held by May 1998.</p>
<p>The government has set a ceremony and royal banquet on Wednesday to celebrate the anniversary of the October 23, 1991 Paris peace accords, which led to the dispatch of a $2 billion U.N. peace-keeping mission to Cambodia.</p>
<p>The uneasy coalition of former enemies was forged after U.N.-run general elections in May 1993, which were boycotted by the Khmer Rouge after they reneged on the Paris pact.</p>
<p>A September 1993 constitution restored the monarchy and embraced a multi-party democracy and a free market economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have more freedoms, more human rights, more democracy and obviously we have more prosperity. The two or three billion dollar investment of the international community was very worthwhile,&quot; said Lao Mong Hay, director of the Khmer Institute of Democracy.</p>
<p>But he noted, &quot;We have not been able to implement the administrative reform so as to strengthen the state apparatus commensurate with the (envisioned pluralistic liberal democratic) political system.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major setback alongside the continuing warfare.&quot;</p>
<p>Co-Defence Minister Tea Banh agreed the war had been the main setback of the past five years, while adding: &quot;There are some guerrillas left, but their activities are decreasing day by day.&quot;</p>
<p>The government's encouragement of defectors has played an important role in draining the power of the rebels in recent years, but the process accelerated dramatically when former top leader Ieng Sary broke with hardliners under Pol Pot in August.</p>
<p>The defections of more than 2,500 Khmer Rouge to the government since October have compounded the rebels' problems, but some analysts believe they could end up reinforcing the innate differences between the FUNCINPEC and CPP.</p>
<p>&quot;They just seem to be contributing to the polarisation,&quot; said an analyst, adding: &quot;They have to make up their minds one way or the other who they're going to be associated with.&quot;</p>
<p>Another analyst saw the coalition problems of the past six months as jockeying for position ahead of the 1998 elections, which he and others said would be a test of the 1991 accord.</p>
<p>&quot;Did the (1993) election achieve stability and peace? I would say not yet, because of the two-headed government. They need another election to solve this problem,&quot; added the veteran Cambodia-watcher.</p>
<p>Information Minister Ieng Mouly said the peace pact had planted the seeds for reconciliation and rehabilitation, while adding: &quot;The heritage that we got from the war is so huge...We cannot end all the difficulties in four or five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Benny Widyono, special U.N. representative to Cambodia, noted economic and political progress, notably more respect for human rights, since the elections, which he saw as a watershed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a marriage ceremony, it legalised the coalition government,&quot; he told Reuters, adding that formation of a coalition had created confidence that was reflected in the influx of foreign aid and tourists and increasing foreign and domestic investment.</p>
<p>Cambodia has enjoyed steady growth since 1991 with per capita GDP forecast at around $300 by the end of the year against $119 five years ago, inflation slashed to 3.5 percent last year from 151 percent, and a local currency relatively stable at 2500 to 2700 riels to the dollar since 1993.</p>
<p>Finance secretary of state Chanthol Sun said the coalition had approved foreign investment projects worth $2.5 billion. He added that recent heavy flooding would trim some indicators, with 1996 GDP (gross domestic product) growth now forecast at six percent and inflation at five percent.</p>
