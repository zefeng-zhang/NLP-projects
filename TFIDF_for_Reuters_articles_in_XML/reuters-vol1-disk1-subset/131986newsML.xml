<p>Siam Cement group, Thailand's largest industrial conglomerate, will show lower profit growth in the second half of 1996 as a sales slowdown and higher costs take the edge off year-end figures, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several indications they will not do too well in the third and fourth quarter,&quot; said Philip Utsch, senior investment analyst at HG Asia Investment Research, &quot;And there is nothing to suggest that trend will change in the short term.&quot;</p>
<p>Sales are expected to be affected by a decrease in private construction investment, coupled with a likely continuation of high interest rates, he said. Rising energy prices have also increased cement production costs, Utsch added.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, the group posted a 12 percent rise in profits, on a consolidated basis, to 4.34 billion baht ($174 million) on higher sales of auto parts and electricals.</p>
<p>Cement business profits, which accounted for about 56 percent of group profits in the first half, were almost flat with Siam Cement Plc posting an increase of just over one percent in net profits.</p>
<p>The group's recent diversification into petrochemicals and steel has been costly because of falling world prices and would hit third quarter and year-end profits, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect profits for the year to be around 8.1 billion baht,&quot; said Sukheer Khanijoh, construction analyst at Thaimex Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Though I believe their prospects remain very bright, the iron and steel business is contributing big losses in the (first) half...of around one billion baht and has been very bad for them. I expect them to post a profit from pulp and paper, though.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the group's increasing vertical intergration made the company more resilient in the face of Thailand's economic slowdown. Most private projections show Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) should grow around seven percent this year, below the central bank's forecast of 7.8 percent.</p>
<p>Youssef Abboud, an investment analyst at Wall Street Finance and Securities Plc, said the Siam Cement group had increased its short-term investment in Thai debt markets.</p>
<p>&quot;They have an increasing amount of interest income on their books,&quot; he said. &quot;They are borrowing at costs of six to seven percent from syndicated and BIBF (offshore) loans which they are converting into Thai baht and investing in promissory notes and certificates of deposits for three to six months. I believe they have around five billion baht in money market instruments.&quot;</p>
<p>Abboud said he expected profits for the year to be in line with, or slightly above, GDP growth. The group's revenue sources are not expected to change markedly this year.</p>
<p>Sukheer said in 1995 Siam Cement group derived 21 percent of its revenues from cement, 17 percent from metal and electricals and 15 percent from paper and packaging. Eleven percent came from auto components, eight percent from construction materials, and seven percent each from ceramics, petrochemicals, trading and iron/steel. ($1 = 25 baht)</p>
