<p>Voting began on Sunday in north Lebanon in the second round of parliamentary elections with 580,000 voters eligible to choose 28 members of the 128-member parliament.</p>
<p>Troops in armoured vehicles patrolled the streets of this predominantly Sunni Moslem port city as polling stations opened at seven a.m. (0400 GMT) and voters began casting their ballots for five rival lists of candidates.</p>
<p>Troops also patrolled the streets of smaller towns as the voting got under way.</p>
<p>The election in north Lebanon, which includes Sunni, Alawite, Greek Orthodox and Maronite communities, follows a first round of voting on August 18 in which supporters of the pro-Syrian government won 32 of 35 seats in Mount Lebanon, the Christian heartland.</p>
<p>Beirut, south Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley will vote on the next three Sundays until September 15.</p>
<p>The Mount Lebanon vote raised a storm of opposition protests against alleged vote-rigging in favour of government supporters.</p>
<p>Several defeated opposition nationalist candidates are preparing appeals to the Constitutional Council to cancel the vote and call a new vote in their districts. However, there are widespread fears of more violations in north Lebanon.</p>
<p>Newspapers have dubbed the north the most confusing round of the five-stage election.</p>
<p>Lebanon has no true national political parties and the five lists of candidates have been formed on the basis of local alliances and personal rivalries without offering a clear choice between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>Supporters of Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, who runs in Beirut next week, are running on different tickets in the north as he seeks to build a national political base.</p>
<p>Almost all candidates are friends of Syria, whose 35,000 troops give it a powerful say in Lebanese affairs and a close interest in the vote. They include four government ministers and 26 parliamentary deputies seeking re-election.</p>
<p>Even candidates who oppose the government are not against its pro-Syrian stance, unlike in the first round in Mount Lebanon when the opposition vowed to stop what they said was the whittling away of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Omar Karami, a Sunni Moslem, and Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite Christian and former minister, are the most prominent anti-government candidates.</p>
<p>Both are harsh critics of Hariri and close friends of Syria. Their list won 25 of the 28 seats in the last elections in 1992, but it could lose seats this time to a rival ticket headed by Karami's cousin Ahmed Karami.</p>
<p>Ahmed's list, like the Karami-Franjieh ticket, includes three Hariri supporters. It also has three candidates of the Sunni Moslem fundamentalist group Gama'a Islamiyeh (Moslem Group) which opposes Hariri.</p>
<p>The Gama'a is allied in parliament with the pro-Iranian Shi'ite Moslem Hizbollah (Party of God) which Hariri denounces as &quot;extremist&quot;.</p>
