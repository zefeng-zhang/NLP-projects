<p>Department 56 Inc, which designs, imports, and distributes giftware, said Tuesday it still expects earnings per share for the full year to approximate or to be slightly below 1995.</p>
<p>In 1995, Department 56 reported earnings of $2.22 a share including a $0.06 per share charge.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the company reported its 1996 third quarter earnings fell to $0.57 a share from $0.84 in the year ago quarter. Sales declined to $60.2 million from $77.0 million.  </p>
<p>Net sales for the nine months ended September 28 were $194.5 million compared with $204.8 million in the same period of fiscal 1995. Nine months net income totaled $41.4 million, excluding a duty refund of $500,000, or $1.91 a share, compared with $42.4 million last year, which did not include a recovery of import duties and an extraordinary charge, or $1.95 a share.</p>
<p>Department 56 said the expected lower sales reflected the impact of fewer orders in the first half of 1996 when dealers worked to address their high inventories.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the timing of shipments from overseas manufacturers, some sales have shifted from the third quarter to the fourth, it said.</p>
<p>Orders for the third quarter of 1996 increased three percent over the same period of 1995. Orders for Christmas collectible product lines, which represent most of the company's business, were strong and more than offset softness in orders for smaller spring season product lines, it said.</p>
<p>Shares of Department 56 were trading off 1-3/8 to 23-5/8.</p>
