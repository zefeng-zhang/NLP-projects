<p>Democrats streamed into this sparkling Midwestern capital on Sunday for a political jamboree designed to banish memories of a riotous, hate-filled 1968 convention and to launch President Bill Clinton towards a second term.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be going the president's way on the eve of a four-day Democratic Party love-fest that will re-nominate him on Wednesday: a festive atmosphere, a handsome lakeside city at its strutting, party-time best, some glorious weather and an oh-so-polite police force.</p>
<p>There were even slight rises in Clinton's poll ratings to top things off.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm on my way to Chicago, and I'm going by train because I want to see people like you that I've been working for and fighting for ... and because I want America to know we are on the right track,&quot; Clinton told a cheering crowd at a railway station in Huntington, West Virginia at the start of a four-day &quot;whistle stop&quot; campaign trip to Chicago.</p>
<p>Even so Clinton was well aware he had serious work to do.</p>
<p>He has to stop Republican Bob Dole becoming America's 1996 &quot;Comeback Kid,&quot; a role Clinton himself invented four years ago when he upset then-President George Bush and broke a Republican grip on the White House.</p>
<p>The prospect of an astonishing Dole rebound no longer seems as far-fetched as it did before the August 12-15 Republican convention in San Diego, which gave the 73-year-old former Senate leader a big boost.</p>
<p>Polls still put Clinton from five to 12 points up on Dole with Reform Party challenger Ross Perot far behind. But that is a far cry from the 20-30 point lead Clinton enjoyed before Dole and running mate Jack Kemp took the limelight in San Diego.    The Republican conclave demonstrated that conventions can</p>
<p>still change the dynamics of a presidential race, even though they are now commonly derided as meaningless rituals.</p>
<p>Clinton ironically has to start the job of blocking Dole's post convention momentum in Chicago -- a city which has long been a historic place of shame for Democrats.</p>
<p>At their last Chicago convention in 1968, raucous anti-Vietnam war demonstrations were met with a brutal police crackdown. Scenes of flailing police billyclubs and wafting teargas were beamed to shocked tv audiences worldwide.</p>
<p>Then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the nomination inside a bitterly divided convention hall, but he effectively lost all chance of defeating Richard Nixon in an election that began a long Republican domination of the presidency.</p>
<p>Chicago hopes to wipe out that stain with a blend of sugar and spice.</p>
<p>Its police force has been trained -- with films of the '68 debacle to hammer home the point -- to provide firm but restrained security in an era more worried by acts of terror than political protests.</p>
<p>The city itself, filled with good restaurants, jazz clubs and nightlife of all sorts, is out to show fun-seeking convention delegates that, in the grammatically garbled words of the old Frank Sinatra tune, their kind of town Chicago is.</p>
<p>Clinton for his part aimed to start nailing down the lid on any Dole revival -- all along his train route through West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, and then at the convention itself -- by stressing a theme, the future versus the past.</p>
<p>This allows him to underscore his rival's advanced age and identity with the World War II generation without seeming mean or disrespectful of a wounded war hero.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old president spelled that out in an interview with the Chicago Tribune, saying, &quot;We should revere the past ... but we've got to build a pathway to the future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our sole concern ought to be, what's this country going to look like when we start the 21st Century ... That is really what this election ought to be about.&quot;</p>
<p>He will take specific aim at Dole's controversial campaign promise of sweeping tax cuts, portraying them as economically irresponsible next to his own more modest pledges, and will accuse the Republicans of harbouring secret plans to slash popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare health insurance.</p>
