<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl defended his battered 14-year government on Monday and urged fellow Christian Democrats to work with their liberal FDP partners to reform the tax system and win reelection in 1998.</p>
<p>Without mentioning a tax dispute that split the coalition last week, Kohl told his CDU's annual congress that he firmly backed Finance Minister Theo Waigel's efforts to cut state spending to qualify for Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>But Kohl reminded the 1,000 delegates that the pro-business Free Democrats, who demand popular tax cuts Waigel says cannot be financed, must also win something for their voters.</p>
<p>Kohl's coalition flirted with collapse last week when Waigel and the FDP battled over a possible petrol tax increase to fill gaps in the 1997 budget. As Germany's self-styled tax-cutting party, the FDP was firmly against it.</p>
<p>They finally agreed to delay a planned cut in the hated solidarity surcharge, a tax to help rebuild the ex-communist east, but coalition leaders continued to squabble over the weekend about when taxes could next be cut or raised.</p>
<p>&quot;This or that could be improved in our coalition, despite all its successes,&quot; Kohl told the delegates assembled in the northern city of Hanover.  He added: &quot;Our goal is clear -- we want to continue this coalition of the centre beyond 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>The tax dispute overshadowed a congress that should have been a trimphal procession for Kohl, who on October 31 will set a new record at post-war Germany's longest-serving chancellor.</p>
<p>In his speech opening the two-day congress, Kohl opted for the same tactic that has kept him going for 14 years, seeking a balance between his often fractious coalition partners.</p>
<p>But the FDP, set back by the loss of a tax cut pledge it had won only last year, kept up the pressure by accusing Waigel of sloppy budget planning and demanding cuts in state spending that would certainly provoke another public outcry.</p>
<p>FDP economics spokesman Otto Lambsdorff said CDU Labour Minister Norbert Bluem &quot;must certainly bleed again&quot; to squeeze even more savings out of his ministry's budget.</p>
<p>Lambsdorff said the FDP would have left the government if Waigel had insisted on raising the petrol tax but added: &quot;We don't want to dissolve the coalition today because we don't see any other partner we could work better with.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl repeated that his government's planned tax reform, which was due to be discussed at the congress on Tuesday, would not be introduced until 1999. The FDP and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have demanded cuts in 1998.</p>
<p>The chancellor, 66, also called for a consensus between employers and unions over another controversial part of his austerity drive. Workers staged wildcat strikes last month when companies tried to impose a cut in sick pay benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no sympathy for those who think this is the time to hollow out the welfare state,&quot; he said in a heavy hint to managers and FDP free-marketeers.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just as little understanding for people who think the necessary changes in society can be held up by threats,&quot; he added for the unions.</p>
<p>In a short section on foreign affairs, Kohl reiterated his belief that Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) would start on schedule in 1999 and said Poland and other east European countries must become members of the EU.</p>
<p>The two-day CDU congress in Hanover was due to discuss plans for tax reform, introduce a quota for women office holders and hold elections for the party leadership. Kohl, CDU chairman for the past 23 years, has no challenger.</p>
<p>Several hundred farmers, many of them with their tractors, demonstrated in front of the congress hall against the European Union's policy on mad cow disease that has cut back beef sales in Germany by about one-third.</p>
<p>They demanded Brussels help them export unsellable beef to the Third World and stop meat imports from eastern Europe.</p>
