<p>When Fatima Husejnovic votes in Bosnia's post-war elections on September 14, she will be carrying a faded postcard in her purse, the only memento of a decent life long gone.</p>
<p>The postcard shows a row of drab apartment blocks in an industrial town called Srebrenica.</p>
<p>For Husejnovic, it evokes a peaceful, prosperous time in old Yugoslavia, before the world associated Srebrenica with terrified refugees and brutal war crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;That's our home,&quot; she said proudly, pointing to a modest, two-storey house in the picture. &quot;We lived well. Everyone had at least one car.&quot;</p>
<p>As Husejnovic marks her absentee ballot on September 14, she will do so hoping the election will bring her back to Srebrenica and the harmonious life she knew before the war.</p>
<p>Conquering Bosnian Serb forces expelled Husejnovic and other Moslem women and children from Srebrenica last July. A Serb soldier took away her husband before he could board her bus.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the last time I saw him.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dayton peace treaty promised Husenjovic and two million other refugees from Bosnia the right to return to their homes before voting in &quot;free and fair&quot; elections.</p>
<p>Instead, nationalist authorities across Bosnia have blocked Moselm, Serb and Croat refugees from coming back, sealing the results of ethnic cleansing and military conquest.</p>
<p>Comprising about half the electorate, the refugees represent a crucial voting bloc for the nationalist parties vying for power.</p>
<p>Robbed of their homes and their dignity, the 1.7 million displaced and refugees who registered to vote are vulnerable to manipulation and blackmail, both psychological and financial.</p>
<p>&quot;For a refugee who has nothing, it means everything when the party offers him a flat or a job,&quot; said a local aid worker in the northeastern city of Tuzla where many Srebrenica refugees ended up.</p>
<p>The architects of Dayton envisaged civilians moving back to their pre-war homes, electing authorites to rule over restored multi-ethnic communities.</p>
<p>But ethnic leaders treat the refugees like chips in an electoral board game, stacking the odds in their own favour.</p>
<p>Before the war, Srebrenica, like many municipalities in eastern Bosnia, had a Moslem majority.</p>
<p>Serb authorities have moved thousands of Serbs into an ethnically &quot;cleansed&quot; Srebrenica in a bid to keep out the original residents.</p>
<p>To tip the electoral balance, refugees who live in neighbouring Serbia have been registered to vote in Srebrenica in what human rights workers call a calculated campaign of &quot;ethnic engineering&quot;.</p>
<p>The battle for control of Srebrenica, in which refugees are mere pawns, reflects a political struggle being waged in dozens of towns across the country.</p>
<p>Prevented from coming home, Husejnovic and other Srebrenica survivors have registered to vote by absentee ballot.</p>
<p>International organisers say the outcome in Srebrenica will be close when voters select cantonal representatives during the September general election and municipal authorities later.</p>
<p>Depending on how many refugees rival ethnic parties can muster, the poll could elect Moslem authorities who could not safely enter the town.</p>
<p>No one knows how such an impasse would be solved, but the refugees fear powerful men will once again decide their fate.</p>
<p>Srebrenica refugees say no one from the Moslem-led government or the international community has even explained the election rules to them or how they will go back home.</p>
<p>Feeling abandoned, Husejnovic has tried to organise the women of Srebrenica, demanding they be allowed to return and learn the truth about their missing loved ones.</p>
<p>She has no office for the organisation and has spent her own money to buy notebooks.</p>
<p>Her attempts to rally the Srebrenica women follow a past littered with broken promises.</p>
<p>She remembers when her town turned into a &quot;prison&quot; teeming with refugees and cut off from food aid.</p>
<p>She remembers French U.N. peackeeping force General Philippe Morillon speaking to the starving, besieged Moslems in the enclave, &quot;Don't be afraid, I will stay with you.&quot;</p>
<p>She remembers when the Moslem officers commanding Srebrenica's defences were called back to Sarajevo for &quot;training&quot;. Five days later, the Bosnian Serb army launched its assault on what the U.N. had declared a &quot;safe area&quot;.</p>
<p>Despite everything, she clings to the belief that the elections will somehow bring her closer to returning home. &quot;We hope we can go back. We have to hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Human rights workers say refugees like Husejnovic, who are more interested in co-existence than territorial conquest, hold the key to any lasting peace and reconciliation in Bosnia.</p>
<p>They fear that if nationalist parties emerge victorious as widely predicted, the elections will prevent Husejnovic from ever returning home.</p>
