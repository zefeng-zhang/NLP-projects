<p>The U.S. Energy Department said Tuesday that it had decided not to appeal a ruling by a federal court that the government must start taking possession of nuclear waste from commercial power plants across the country in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. Department of Energy in consultation with the Department of Justice has decided not to seek Supreme Court review of the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Indiana Michigan Power Co v. the Department of Energy,&quot; the Energy Department said.  </p>
<p>But the department said it had not yet decided how to carry out the appeals court's July ruling on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which called for the government to take over control of radioactive waste from commercial power plants by January 31, 1998.</p>
<p>The court rejected the Clinton administration's argument that Congress never intended for the government to start remove waste from power plants if it had no safe site to dump the spent fuel.</p>
<p>&quot;The Department is reviewing its options for how to proceed,&quot; a department spokeswoman said.  </p>
<p>The Energy Department has resisted planning a temporary storage site out of concern it would divert resources from the effort to build a long-delayed permanent dump at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which it expects to be ready in 2010.</p>
<p>But utilities with nuclear plants, who have paid $12 billion into a federal fund to build a spent fuel dump, have pressed Congress to force the Energy Department to start removing the waste from their plants in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The appeals court ruling stands as the definitive legal statement thus far on the federal obligation to store fuel in 1998, and it certainly makes reforming the nuclear waste program a top priority for the next Congress and next administration,&quot; said Steven Unglesbee, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), which represents utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way for the government to meet its obligation to consumers is for the federal nuclear waste program to be reformed and include an interim waste facility that can hold the fuel till a repository is ready,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nine nuclear plants in Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin have already run out of space in pools for spent fuel and have begun relying on storage above ground in canisters, according to NEI.</p>
