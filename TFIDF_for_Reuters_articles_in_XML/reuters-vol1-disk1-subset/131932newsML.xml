<p>The pace of economic recovery in the Kansai region of western Japan is unlikely to accelerate drastically in the coming months, Bank of Japan (BOJ) Osaka branch manager Eiichiro Kinoshita said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The gradual (economic) recovery will continue, but there are no clear prospects in sight for it to gain momentum and accelerate,&quot; Kinoshita, a BOJ executive director, told a news conference on the first day of a BOJ branch managers' meeting.</p>
<p>He said most see little change in the regional economic condition in the six months to March. Economic prospects for the next fiscal year remain uncertain, he said.  </p>
<p>Consumer spending was weaker than expected this summer due to a food poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 strain of the E. coli bacteria. Slower sales of air conditioners from late July also dampened consumption in the Osaka region, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But retail sales rebounded in the autumn. Consumer sentiment did not cool after the drop in the summer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some companies have revised down their capital spending plans, but most are carrying them out as scheduled, and corporate profits are also on an increasing trend, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The solidness in private consumption and corporate capital spending have not crumbled,&quot; Kinoshita said.  </p>
<p>The current sluggishness in the semiconductor market would not have a great impact on electronics makers in the Kansai region as their strength lies in home appliances such as refrigerators which are posting record sales, he said.</p>
<p>Spending on housing construction and public works projects remained high, and an expected falling off in this in the coming months would not be so severe in the region, he said.</p>
<p>Stock adjustments in some industries were unlikely to have a great impact on the economy as a whole either, he said.</p>
<p>The weaker yen would not boost exports dramatically, but would rather work to slow down the pace of imports, he said.  </p>
<p>In reports on regional economies submitted to the two-day gathering, BOJ branch managers in other parts of the country also said the economies in their regions remained on a gradual recovery track.</p>
