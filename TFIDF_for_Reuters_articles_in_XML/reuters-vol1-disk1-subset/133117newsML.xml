<p>Poland's Roman Catholic Church, which says its ties with the state have plunged to the lowest point in years, pleaded with parliament on Tuesday not to pass a bill liberalising the country's current anti-abortion law.</p>
<p>The bishops, ending an annual plenary conference, wrote to the lower house speaker asking deputies not to overturn a Senate veto on the bill when they vote on the issue this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that you face a decision which -- for various reasons -- is hard for you. But we appeal to you: Stand in defence of life,&quot; said the letter quoted by PAP news agency.</p>
<p>The Senate blocked the bill early this month and its lower house backers must muster a majority of 50 percent plus one vote to pass the measure, which they first approved in August.</p>
<p>The vote could be close, as members of the SLD's smaller Peasant party coalition partner may opt against the bill.</p>
<p>The measure would allow women to end pregnancies before the 12th week, if they cannot afford to raise a child or have other personal problems, but only after counselling and reflection.</p>
<p>Abortions are currently allowed only if a pregnancy threatens a woman's life or health, results from rape or incest, or when the foetus is irreparably damaged.</p>
<p>The reform's backers, including the ruling, ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), say the bill, which also provides for sex education in schools and cheaper contraception, will prevent much misery.</p>
<p>They argue that abortion tourism in neighbouring states is anyway easily available to women with money.</p>
<p>But the church, backed by the full authority of Polish-born Pope John Paul, has desperately fought what it sees as a licence to kill unborn children.</p>
<p>The issue is one of several deeply straining relations between the church and the ruling, secular-minded left, led by politicians who were part of the pre-1989 communist system.</p>
<p>On Monday the Episcopate's Secretary-General, Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, said that these relations had never been so bad since 1993, when the ex-communists won parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>&quot;All threads of agreement have been snapped,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Apart from the abortion issue, the church and SLD have clashed over parliament's delays in ratifying a concordat treaty with the Vatican which was concluded by a previous, pro-Catholic government just before the 1993 elections.</p>
<p>The church also wants Poland's new constitution now being drafted to invoke God, an idea rejected by much of the SLD.</p>
<p>Such issues may become a significant theme in parliamentary elections due in September next year, especially as 90 percent of Poles are at least nominally Catholics.</p>
<p>An alliance of right-wing parties grouped around the militantly pro-church Solidarity is running neck and neck with the SLD in opinion polls.</p>
<p>Ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski and the party's prime minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz on Tuesday both urged the Church to be open to greater compromise on issues dividing Polish society.</p>
