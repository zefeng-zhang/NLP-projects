<headline>RTRS - Foster's shares dip after Molson upset.</headline>

<p>Shares of Foster's Brewing Group Ltd were down four cents in a firming market on Monday after a Canadian tribunal ruled against a licensing deal between its Canadian associate, Molson Breweries, and U.S. brewer Adolph Coors Co.</p>
<p>The stock was trading at A$2.36 at 12.10 p.m. (0210 GMT), five cents weaker than Friday's strong close, while the All Ordinaries index was up 16 points or 0.69 percent.</p>
<p>Foster's hit a morning low of A$2.34.</p>
<p>But share analysts declined to attribute all of the fall to last Friday's tribunal decision.  </p>
<p>The tribunal found that Molson breached its agreement with Coors Brewing Co by allowing Coor's U.S. rival, Miller Brewing Co, to buy a 20 percent of Molson.</p>
<p>&quot;It's sheer profit-taking,&quot; said Michael Heffernan, head of equity research at Shaw Stockbroking in Sydney. Foster's closed on Friday at its highest closing price in at least two years.</p>
<p>&quot;My view is it (the tribunal ruling) should not have any impact as such on Foster's -- on Molson, yes, but Foster's probably not,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Molson said in a statement issued here by Foster's that the negative impact on Molson's profit would be material.  </p>
<p>But the impact will not be known until talks between Molson and Coors, aimed at negotiating a new agreement, are concluded, Molson chief executive John Barnett said in the statement.</p>
<p>Molson, a unit of Molson Cos Ltd, is owned 40 percent by Foster's.</p>
<p>A Canadian arbitration panel ruled last Friday that Molson relinquished all rights to brew and distribute Coors brands when Miller, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, bought 20 percent of Molson Breweries in April 1993.  </p>
<p>The panel returned the Canadian rights to Coors and requires Molson Breweries to pay Coors all of Molson's profits derived from the sale of Coors products since April 1993.</p>
<p>Foster's analyst Greg Cathro, of Adelaide-based broker Todd Partners, said uncertainty would weigh on Foster's share price until the ruling's impact on profit was known.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obviously not a mortal blow or a severe wound, but it's something that will create uncertainty,&quot; Cathro said.</p>
