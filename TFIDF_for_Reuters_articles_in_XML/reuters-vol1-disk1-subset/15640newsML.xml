<p>British insurer Prudential Corp said on Tuesday it had agreed to sell its Mercantile &amp; General (M&amp;G) reinsurance operation to Swiss Reinsurance Co in a 1.75 billion pounds ($2.72 billion) deal.</p>
<p>Prudential said in a statement that the sale of M&amp;G, which resulted from a strategic review of operations, was agreed on Monday and should be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Prudential, whose shares jumped 8 pence to 445 pence on news of the sale, said it would receive of 1.704 billion pounds in cash, and the deal would also involve Swiss re paying a special dividend of 50 million pounds to Prudential.</p>
<p>Prudential had said in June that it intended to float part of M&amp;G on the stock market later this year. But a trade sale had not been ruled out.</p>
<p>&quot;Since this (June) announcement, we have received a number of approaches from potential trade purchasers,&quot; said Prudential group chief executive Peter Davis in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We have decided that a sale of the whole company at the agreed price, which we believe substantially exceeds what we could have achieved through a public offering, is clearly in the best interests of our sharehlders,&quot; said Davis.</p>
<p>He said the deal would allow Prudential to concentrate its resources on developing its retail financial services business in Britain, the United States and Asia.</p>
<p>The group has for some time been looking to buy a building society or life assurer in Britain.</p>
<p>M&amp;G last year had gross written premiums of 1.3 billion pounds and net assets at the end of 1995 of 1.1 billion pounds.</p>
<p>M&amp;G chief executive John Engestrom said M&amp;G's clients and staff would benefit from being part of what would become the world's largest life and health reinsurer. ($1=.6436 Pound)</p>
