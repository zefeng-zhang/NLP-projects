<p>Norway's Transocean ASA and Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc of the United States completed their marriage on Wednesday to form one of the world's largest drilling companies.</p>
<p>The new group, Transocean Offshore Inc, came to life after Sonat's stock exchange offer expired on Tuesday, capturing 94 percent, or 50.9 million shares, of the outstanding equity in the Norwegian driller and offshore service company.</p>
<p>Houston-based Sonat beat off rival suitor Reading &amp; Bates (R&amp;B) in June when Transocean's largest shareholder, Tiger Management Corp, switched allegiance to Sonat after initially recommending R&amp;B's bid.</p>
<p>Sonat on Wednesday said it would move quickly to begin a mandatory offer for the remaining six-percent stake in Transocean in accordance with Norwegian securities regulations.</p>
<p>Reidar Lund, president and chief executive officer of the former Transocean group, said the company had achieved a long-held goal.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a strategic goal we have been pursuing since 1990 when we were first listed,&quot; Lund told Reuters. &quot;Since then we have gone through several mergers in Norway and, to a certain extent, consolidated the Norwegian drilling industry.</p>
<p>&quot;But to be a major international player we had to find a foreign partner. Now we are creating the absolute premier harsh environment, deep water drilling company in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>In the exchange, Sonat will issue around 22.9 million shares of Sonat common stock and about $207 million in cash. Transocean shareholders requesting cash will receive $27.25 per share, while the remaining shareholders will receive $3.43 in cash plus 0.4633 shares of Sonat's common stock.</p>
<p>Sonat will offer a cash price of $28.74 per share for the remaining shares under the mandatory bid.</p>
<p>The new company holds one of the most modern fleets with 27 rigs, operating in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;These are all the important deep water areas in the world,&quot; said Lund. &quot;The harsh environment, deep water sector holds promising growth potential. In Europe alone we see an exciting period ahead as we move into the Atlantic margin, west of Shetland and to the Barents Sea in the Norwegian sector.&quot;</p>
<p>The corporate headquarters for Transocean Offshore will be based in Houston. The company will also have offices in Tananger, near the Norwegian oil capital of Stavanger, to oversee activities in the North Sea, Europe and Africa.</p>
