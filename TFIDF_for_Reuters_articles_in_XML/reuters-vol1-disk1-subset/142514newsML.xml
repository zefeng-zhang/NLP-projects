<p>World number one Pete Sampras enjoyed what he described as `a dream day' on Friday, taking just under an hour to crush Andre Agassi in their quarter-final clash at the Stuttgart Open.</p>
<p>The three-times Wimbledon champion played some superb tennis on his way to a 6-4 6-1 victory in 57 minutes and afterwards rated the performance as one of his best ever.</p>
<p>&quot;These are days you dream about,&quot; the 25-year-old American said. &quot;I was in a zone...everything I tried just clicked. I could not have played any better.&quot;</p>
<p>Sampras joined former grand slam champions Boris Becker and Michael Chang as well as Dutchman Jan Siemerink in the semifinals of the $2.2 million tournament, a key event in the build-up to next month's season-ending world championship in the German city of Hanover.</p>
<p>Sampras will meet Siemerink in the last four while three-times Wimbledon champion Becker takes on former French Open champion Chang.</p>
<p>Sampras and the 26-year-old Agassi have clashed in three major grand slam finals, most recently in 1995 when Sampras won the U.S. Open in four sets.</p>
<p>Friday's match, however, was no classic. Agassi, who needs some good results in the next few weeks to make sure of his place in Hanover, was far from his best.</p>
<p>The Las Vegan, ranked ninth in the world, hit some brilliant returns but was not consistent enough to challenge the sport's best player.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still amazed at the way Andre can return serve,&quot; Sampras said. &quot;But it was tough to beat me today...this was among the top five matches in my career as far as being in a great rhythm is concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never returned like that before. Playing Agassi forces you to do things like that.&quot;</p>
<p>After the two Americans held their opening service games, the first set saw an extraordinary seven breaks of serve in eight games.</p>
<p>But Sampras kept his nerve, clinching the first set after 36 minutes when Agassi hit a forehand out.</p>
<p>Agassi never fully recovered his composure as Sampras raced to a 5-0 lead in the second set on his way to victory.</p>
<p>Siemerink beat Croatian fifth seed Goran Ivanisevic 6-3 7-6 in his quarter-final while Chang booked his place in the semifinals with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Chile's 10th seed Marcelo Rios.</p>
<p>Becker delighted his fanatical home fans with a powerful display of serving in a 6-2 6-2 victory over Swede Magnus Gustafsson in the evening.</p>
<p>The performance boosted the German's chances of securing his place among the top eight players in the world rankings and therefore qualifying for Hanover. Last year Becker won the championship, formerly known as the Masters.</p>
