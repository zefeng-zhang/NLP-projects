<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam demanded a &quot;clear apology&quot; on Monday from North Korea over the intrusion of a submarine last month.</p>
<p>However, in a speech delivered by his prime minister to parliament, Kim appeared to take a softer line on the incident, making no mention of any reprisals and stressing that an offer of peace talks was still on the table.</p>
<p>Kim has previously been quoted as saying the submarine intrusion could lead to &quot;all-out war&quot; and hinting it could scuttle South Korean aid to the hungry North and delay implementation of a nuclear agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea should confess, make a clear apology and promise not to make the same kind of provocation again,&quot; he said in his speech to the National Assembly read by Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung.</p>
<p>The Shark-class submarine landed 26 North Koreans on an east coast beach on September 18. Twenty-two have been killed and one captured. A hunt is on for three others.</p>
<p>Far from apologising, North Korea has threatened to retaliate &quot;a hundredfold or a thousandfold&quot; over the killings and has demanded the return of the bodies, the survivors and the submarine.</p>
<p>&quot;If they push us beyond our endurance, we will take stern steps under the Korea-U.S. joint defence posture,&quot; Kim's speech said.</p>
<p>The U.S. maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea to deter any North Korean military action.</p>
<p>Kim urged Pyongyang to respond to an offer he put forward with U.S. President Bill Clinton for four-party talks, including China, to replace an armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War with a peace arrangement.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea should wake up from its anachronistic illusion about unifying the country by force and make efforts to improve the livelihood of its people and cooperate towards national harmony,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He called the intrusion a provocation that had &quot;betrayed our humanitarian efforts to help North Korea and our brotherly affection and the goodwill of the international community&quot;.</p>
<p>It showed North Korea's strategy to unify the Korean peninsula by force &quot;has not changed at all&quot;.</p>
<p>Washington is concerned the incident could raise tensions between the two Koreas and threaten its 1994 agreement with North Korea under which Pyongyang pledged to freeze its suspected nuclear weapons programme in return for two light-water reactors from Seoul.</p>
<p>Privately, South Korean officials say that there is no change in South Korea's support for the project, but implementation will be delayed until Seoul believes it is safe to send a survey team to the proposed reactor site.</p>
<p>Seoul has delivered on all outstanding offers of aid to North Korea and there is no more in the pipeline, making it hard to gauge its official stance on assistance.</p>
<p>Last week Kim sacked his defence minister as part of a sweeping reshuffle of the military top brass after criticism of security lapses that allowed the submarine to slip in unnoticed.</p>
<p>Seoul has portrayed the moves as an effort to toughen its defences against North Korea.</p>
