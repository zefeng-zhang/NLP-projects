<p>Singapore prime minister Goh Chok Tong on Sunday quashed speculation of an early general election in the city-state, saying there would be no polls before the end of October.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in no hurry,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Asked by journalists about comments he was reported to have made at a National Day dinner on Saturday evening, Goh confirmed saying he now only had four possible &quot;windows&quot; for the elections, all of them after October.</p>
<p>&quot;I was as clear as I could (be) last night. That is that you can go on leave in October. I mentioned there were four windows left, any one of them I think I would be happy with,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In July, Goh said there were five windows in which the election could be held: September, November, December, during the Chinese Lunar New Year in February 1997 and after the budget debate in March.</p>
<p>There is no legal requirement to elect a new parliament until April 1997, but Goh's unbeaten People's Action Party (PAP) usually calls elections long before they are due.</p>
<p>Goh hinted he may wait until the last possible moment to hold elections.</p>
<p>&quot;If you remember back in 1991, I said I would go the full term and people seem to have forgotten that -- and full-term means a good five years,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;If I feel the time is right, then I will call the election.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation over the exact date of the election has been mounting since Goh's announcement on August 18 that the election would be &quot;soon&quot;.</p>
<p>But a recent spate of poor economic news has encouraged some economists to suggest the polls may be postponed.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Singapore announced a sharp decline in its economic growth in the second quarter, to seven percent from 10.9 percent a year ago, which officials said was due to a slump in its key electronics market.</p>
<p>As a result, most economists have cut their growth forecasts for the third quarter and many suggest a real turnaround may not occur until the beginning of 1997.</p>
<p>Commenting on the economic slowdown, Goh said he was cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The downturn is felt in the electronics industry, which of course then would have some influence on maybe the financial sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to say how long it will last. The downturn has come very suddenly and more sharply than people expected. We are dealing with a very volatile industry. Three months, six months, that is possible.&quot;</p>
