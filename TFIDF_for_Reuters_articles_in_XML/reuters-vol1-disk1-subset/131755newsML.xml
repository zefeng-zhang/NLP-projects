<p>Listed firms on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in September recorded slightly better earnings for the third straight month, but analysts did not expect the results to trigger sharp bourse price rises.</p>
<p>Rather, they said, investors would make selective buys that could help the market consolidate or slightly extend its more than 90-percent gain this year so far.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that when it comes to the year-end if we have this (earnings growth) trend continuing that people will say, 'Fantastic, the market is a lot cheaper than we thought it was,&quot; said Stephen Pettyfer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.</p>
<p>Pettyfer said the main market's WIG index, which dropped 2.3 percent on Monday to 14,380.3 points, would likely not fall below 14,000 points and could end the year around 15,000.</p>
<p>Earnings were seen possibly helping the market mood.</p>
<p>Analysts said construction firms in September had joined banks as representing a populous bourse sector showing good results, with many builders currently making up their poor results over the harsh winter of the first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take into consideration how bad the first quarter was, then what some firms have done over nine months is no mean feat,&quot; said Tomasz Berent of IB Austria Securities in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Berent pointed to main market construction firms such as Elektrobudowa and Elektromontaz Export , which netted 151 percent and 126 percent more this September than last, and Exbud , whose parent company netted 392 percent more.</p>
<p>But Berent noted that Exbud and the other two firms publishing comparative consolidated earnings, Agros  and Mostostal Export , showed better parent than group earnings, with Exbud making a consolidated gain of 67 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts were moderately optimistic about earnings over the final quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy's going reasonably well, with firms a reflection of that, and listed firms tend to outperform other,&quot; said Dariusz Szepieniec of Bank Slaski brokerage, who said the main market could reach 16,000 points by year-end.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rebound by construction firms suggested other weather-sensitive firms such as paintmakers Polifarb Cieszyn and Polifarb Wroclaw and cement firm Gorazdze could do well over the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>They said that of main market firms Swarzedz had the most catching up to do after its auditor recommended it form a reserve for receivables, causing losses of 28.5 million zlotys for September and 34 million for the first nine months.</p>
