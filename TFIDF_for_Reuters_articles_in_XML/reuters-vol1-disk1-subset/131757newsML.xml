<p>Profit-takers hit Tokyo's bourse on Monday after a general election left the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) without a clear majority.</p>
<p>The stock market's key Nikkei 225 average lost 309.35 points, or 1.43 percent, but trade was muted with many investors adopting a wait-and-see stance after Sunday's poll, brokers said.</p>
<p>Elswehere in Asia, Singapore's bourse lost one percent, while Bangkok, Taipei, Seoul and Sydney gained ground.</p>
<p>Markets in Hong Kong and Bombay were closed for holidays.</p>
<p>Current Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is likely to remain head of a coalition government forged through an alliance with smaller parties.</p>
<p>Brokers said disappointment over the lack of an LDP majority in the key Lower House sparked a sell-off in Tokyo, eroding last week's gains. The Nikkei ended at 21,302.95.</p>
<p>&quot;The profit-taking was accelerated by disappointment that the Liberal Democratic Party did not win a majority,&quot; said Akihiro Naemura, strategist at Okasan Securities.</p>
<p>Many in the markets are concerned that yet another unwieldy coalition government could lead to friction over policies and impede Japan's already sluggish economic recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Eyes are now on what sort of coalition government will be formed and what sort of policies will be carried out,&quot; Naemura said. &quot;Until the new government starts functioning, with economic stimulus policies strong enough to lure investors off the sidelines, the market is likely to be very quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore shares slid, with falls in a range of heavyweight stocks as foreign institutions continued to sell.</p>
<p>The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed down 20.29 points, or 0.98 percent, at 2,044.23.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are net sellers of this market,&quot; said one local broker. &quot;They say they are looking for a time to buy but are concerned there doesn't seem to be a bottom yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Thai stocks rose for the fourth day, despite profit-taking by local retail investors, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index finished 0.43 point, or 0.05 percent, higher at 948.52 on thin turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;The market moved in a narrow range throughout the session today as investors watched for the release of third quarter financial results of finance firms,&quot; said Virat Tippanontakul of First Asia Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them were better than earlier expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>The Taiwan stock index ended slightly higher after moving in a narrow range, the index up 9.20 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 6,441.15.</p>
<p>Seoul stocks were marginally higher after institutional selling in the afternoon erased most early gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite index ended at 832.62, up 1.44 points, or 0.17 percent, on the day, but off an intra-day high of 844.51.</p>
<p>The Australian share market finished just a few points away from its record closing high after resource stocks found support on the back of a firmer copper price and another record close for the Dow on Friday.</p>
<p>The key market barometer, the All Ordinaries index, closed 8.2 points, or 0.35 percent, higher at 2,363.2, three points off last week's record high close of 2,366.2.</p>
<p>Jakarta's share index rose 2.27 points, or 0.40 percent, to close at 572.47 points after touching an intra-day low of 569.45 points in early trade.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was likely to be more active on Tuesday as bargain-hunters targeted heavyweights on perceptions that prices were low.</p>
<p>At 1120 GMT, the dollar was trading at 112.87/2.97 yen and 1.5382/84 marks.</p>
<p>SIMEX Brent December futures were firmer in thin trading, supported by ongoing worries over heating oil stocks.</p>
<p>December last traded at $24.70 per barrel, up 17 cents from London's settlement.</p>
<p>Gold bullion was slightly weaker in Tokyo, closing at US$379.65/380.15, down from New York's close of US$380.10/50.</p>
