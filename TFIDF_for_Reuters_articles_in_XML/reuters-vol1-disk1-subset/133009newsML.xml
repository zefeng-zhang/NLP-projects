<p>* Toronto stocks posted third consecutive record close on Tuesday * Gains led by gold, base metals, consumer products * Traders see lower interest rates * 105.2 million shares traded  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks hit new highs for a third-straight session on Tuesday, buoyed by stronger gold prices and the prospect of lower Canadian interest rates.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Index added 14.91 points to close at 5532.99, beating Monday's record finish when the Canadian market broke through the key 5500-point barrier for the first time.</p>
<p>The TSE also set an intraday peak of 5550.67.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the (Canadian) dollar and the domestic economy, the Bank of Canada still has room to lower interest rates,&quot; said Subodh Kumar, chief equities strategist at CIBC Wood Gundy.  </p>
<p>Canada's consumer price index (CPI), minus food and energy prices, rose 1.2 percent in September, Statistics Canada said today. Economists had forecast a core CPI of 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>The weaker-than-expected data sparked a bond rally and expectations for a rate cut. The Canadian dollar weakened initially on the CPI, but rebounded to end firmer on the day.</p>
<p>Among the TSE's 14 sub-groups, golds led the charge for a second consecutive day as COMEX gold futures recovered from a six-week decline. Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 499 to 467 with 275 issues unchanged. Trading was brisk with 105.2 million shares exchanging hands worth C$1.62 billion.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Barrick Gold Corp led active gold stocks, rising 0.50 to 36.15 on 3.09 million shares. Barrick reported lower third quarter earnings due to an after-tax charge and higher costs.</p>
<p>* Bre-X Minerals Ltd did not join the move higher, falling 0.30 to 20.50 on 2.5 million shares. Teck Corp, which closed up 1.25 at 28.25, said earlier today it does not plan to bid for the junior gold miner.</p>
<p>* Rate sensitive banks were active. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rose 0.20 to 55.25 on 2.1 million shares. Bank of Nova Scotia added 0.35 to 41.95 on 1.5 million shares.</p>
