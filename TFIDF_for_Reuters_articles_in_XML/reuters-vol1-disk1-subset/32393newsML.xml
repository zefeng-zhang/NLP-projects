<p>As Belgium continued to reel in the wake of a series of child sex abuse and murder horrors, the European Commission announced on Wednesday it would propose new measures to stamp out child pornography and the sex trade.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a challenge to all of us to assume our responsabilities and respond as quickly as we can,&quot; Commissioner Leon Brittan told the European Parliament, convenying the Commission's &quot;deep sense of shock and horror&quot; at the tragic events.</p>
<p>The EU executive would study carefully the conclusions and action plan drawn up by the recent international conference in Swededn on the sexual exploitation of children, Brittan said.</p>
<p>It was already drafting proposals for stamping out child sex tourism and was working on a communication on ways to prevent trafficking in women and young girls for prostitution, which would include issues such as migration and increased police cooperation.</p>
<p>The Irish Presidency's proposal to extend the mandate of the fledgling European police force, Europol, to cover trafficking in human being was a very welcome development, Brittan said.</p>
<p>While freedom of information was a basic right and a delicate constitutional issue, the Commission wanted to find ways to prevent abuse of the Internet by paedophile rings, Brittan continued.</p>
<p>MEPs were unanimous in their calls for urgent action.</p>
<p>Belgian Christian Democrat Raphael Chanterie slammed Europeans for continuing to tolerate sex tourism to Asia, advertised openly in the West, and do nothing to stop the trade in Eastern women for the European sex industry.</p>
<p>The member states must urgently ratify the Europol convention and agree on a European telematics system which would make police cooperation possible, he said.</p>
<p>French Union for Europe MEP Marie-Therese Hermange said the inter-governmental conference on reform of the EU treaty should give the EU the power to tackle trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>Child abuse should be made a crime of humanity and trade in pornographic material a criminal offence, she said.</p>
<p>The European Parliament is due to reconsider the question of child abuse at its plenary session in Strasbourg on September 16-20.</p>
