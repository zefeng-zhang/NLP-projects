<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-World base metal markets in steady growth - MIM.</title>

<p>World base metals consumption was likely to grow steadily over the medium-term after increasing by 3.3 percent in 1995, Nick Stump, chief executive of MIM Holdings Ltd, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Strong growth in east Asia, including India and China, was likely to contribute significantly to base metal demand, he told the Australia-Japan Business Cooperation Committees meeting.</p>
<p>Copper demand was expected to continue to grow because of strong growth in Asia, mild growth in Western Europe and recovery in Eastern Europe, he said.  </p>
<p>Copper would benefit from new infrastructure being developed in East Asian economies over the next few years, he said.</p>
<p>Despite expected higher demand, increased production was expected to create a build-up of stocks, creating downward pressure on the copper price until world demand began to consume excess stocks, he said.</p>
<p>This was likely to occur in late 1998/99.</p>
<p>After a 3.7 percent growth in world zinc prices in 1995, strong demand and moderate supply growth were likely to cause stocks to decrease, placing some upward pressure on prices, he said.  </p>
<p>World lead prices, up by 14 percent in 1995, were expected to come under upward pressure with world consumption expected to outstrip production, Stump said.</p>
<p>The world nickel market is expected to be tight over the next two years after a 31 percent rise in the average world price in 1995, he said.</p>
<p>Although world aluminium prices are expected to increase after the 22 percent 1995 increase in spot prices, a significant amount of idle capacity was likely to limit the extent of the increases, he said.  </p>
<p>Japan, which imported US$480 million worth of non-ferrous raw materials from Australia in 1995 for a 12 percent share of the market, expects the profitability of its smelters to show great improvement in fiscal 1995, Takashi Sakamoto, president of Nippon Mining and Metals Co Ltd, said.</p>
<p>Profits were expected to be generally satisfactory in fiscal 1996, he said. But Japan did not expect to show a significant increase in demand for non-ferrous metals, he said.</p>
<p>In copper, this would result from time needed to reform the post-bubble crash Japanese economy, which had also entered a mature phase, he said.  </p>
<p>Sakamoto forecast that Japanese domestic demand for copper would rise by one percent in 1996 and that domestic demand for lead would decrease to 272,000 tonnes from 280,000 tonnes in 1995 because of declining automobile production.</p>
<p>Zinc demand in 1996 was expected to decline by four percent to 720,000 tonnes, reflecting dullness in automobile industries and manufactures shifting abroad.</p>
<p>After a 10 percent rise  in 1995, Japanese nickel demand in 1996 was expected to fall by seven percent, he said.</p>
