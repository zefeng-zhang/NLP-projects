<p>Chile can expect economic growth to cool off next year and inflation to drop to its lowest levels since the early 1960s, interim Central Bank President Jorge Marshall said.</p>
<p>Marshall, in the bank's report on 1997 economic projections to Congress, said the gross domestic product would expand by 5.5 to six percent, down from about seven percent this year.</p>
<p>The inflation target will be 5.5 percent, he said.  That would be down from projections of about 6.5 percent this year and the lowest since 5.5 percent in 1960.  </p>
<p>&quot;For 1997, we expect to continue with a gradual reduction in inflation, accompanied by economic growth that will be significant but below the trend over the last few years,&quot; Marshall told lawmakers at Congress in Valparaso.</p>
<p>&quot;This will allow us to continue on the path of stability, growth and development,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said solid financing of public spending, and moderation in the rise in both public and private spending, would be &quot;necessary and complementary elements in monetary policy to achieve these macroeconomic goals.&quot;  </p>
<p>Overall, Marshall's message was one of weaker growth, fiscal prudence and adverse conditions for export prices.</p>
<p>The government's current accounts deficit will widen to about $2.85 billion next year, or about four percent of GDP, he said. He attributed that deficit to this year's trade gap -- which he projected to be about $350 million -- and for higher service payments of about $300 million.</p>
<p>The balance of payments will post an overall surplus of $800 million next year, with a surplus in capital accounts more than making up for the current accounts deficit, said Marshall.</p>
<p>All told, Chile can expect a net capital inflow next year of $3.65 billion, about $3.1 billion of which are medium and long-term investments, he said.</p>
<p>New foreign investment should total next year about $1.7 billion, while new credit disbursements should total about $3.2 billion and amortizations about $1.8 billion, said Marshall.</p>
