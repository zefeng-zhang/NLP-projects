<p>The Czech September trade deficit should hold steady at around 14 billion crowns after a 14.7 billion crown monthly deficit in August, a Reuters poll of Czech economists showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Czech trade figures for the first nine months are scheduled to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 0900 local time (0700 GMT) on Thursday.</p>
<p>Most economists surveyed said they expect steady growth in the deficit and few surprises.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still too early to talk about a period of stabilisation in the deficit, I think that will come in 1997 when imports level off and exports strengthen,&quot; Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters.</p>
<p>Whatever the deficit in September, the nine-month trade gap is sure to be a record, after the January-August figure reached 100.9 billion crowns, more than all of the 1995's total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The January-September 1995 trade deficit was 62.3 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Most analysts agreed a 13-15 September gap would be in-line with prevailing trends, and on target for the estimated deficit of 150-160 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction over the figures, as long as they do not vary greatly from the estimates.</p>
<p>Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in the economies of western Europe earlier in the year, and a the effects of a recovery of demand in western Europe have yet to make an impact.</p>
<p>CSU figures show import growth was exceeding export growth by about 15 percent versus just over two percent over the last three months.</p>
<p>The government and central bank, however, has repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports.</p>
<p>Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Economists said the deficit could be financed this year, but might pose problems in the second half of 1997.</p>
