<title>CROATIA: Croatian stocks lower, downward trend to continue.</title>
<headline>Croatian stocks lower, downward trend to continue.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1996-10-23</dateline>

<p>Croatian stocks closed mostly lower on Wednesday, and traders predict only the leading blue chip issues to resist strong pressure from the bears.</p>
<p>&quot;The bears are prevailing at the moment, and we expect the most issues, particularly hoteliers, to continue the downward trend,&quot; said Zoran Ilic from Consult Invest brokerage.</p>
<p>He said only the top Croatian shares -- fully listed drug firm Pliva and the country's leading commercial bank Zagrebacka Banka -- would be able to resist the trend.</p>
<p>Of ten active issues in Wednesday trading eight were down and two up.</p>
<p>The turnover of 11.4 million kuna and volume at 7,075 shares were both higher, but still relatively low in comparison with the past few weeks which saw much livelier trading.</p>
<p>The top gainer was Pliva, which rose 289 kuna to close at 13,300 on 538 shares sold.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was Istrian hotelier Riviera from Porec, which fell 30 kuna to close at 220 kuna on a small volume of 70 shares.</p>
<p>Of other tourist companies Jadranturist from Rovinj lost 10 kuna to 340, and Suncani Hvar also fell 10 kuna to close at 70 on a significant volume of 1,715 shares.</p>
<p>Ilic said strong pressure from small investors to sell hotel shares would keep lowering their price in the immediate future, but he predicted stabilisation later in the year.</p>
<p>Also on the losing side was confectioner Kras which, after falling under the psychological barrier of 700 kuna on Tuesday, lost another 25 kuna to close at 670, with 816 shares traded.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka Banka closed at 1,035 kuna, losing 15 kuna from Tuesday's all-time high, with a record 2,709 shares traded.</p>
<p>But the bank's E-series shares rose 50 kuna to close at 480 on meagre volume of 53 shares.</p>
<p>The central bank exchange rate was fixed at 5.4566 kuna =$1, down from 5.4928 on Tuesday.</p>
