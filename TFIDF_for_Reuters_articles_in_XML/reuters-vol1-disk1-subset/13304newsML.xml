<p>Urging Americans to &quot;stay on the right track,&quot; President Bill Clinton embarked on Sunday on a four-day whistle-stop train tour of middle America hoping to generate popular enthusiasm for his re-election bid.</p>
<p>&quot;I've come here to say to you, I'm on my way to Chicago (for the Democratic National Convention),&quot; Clinton told a crowd of several thousand at the Old C&amp;O Train Station in Huntington in West Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm going on a train, because I want to see the people like you that I've been working for and fighting for, for four years.&quot;</p>
<p>After shaking hands, Clinton boarded the &quot;21st Century Express&quot; and it chugged away on a slow winding route that will take him through parts of five states before depositing him within helicopter range of Chicago, where he will deliver his renomination acceptance speech on Thursday.</p>
<p>His first stop was Ashland, Kentucky, then he was to proceed on into Ohio for the evening. Then it's on to Michigan and Indiana.</p>
<p>Whistle-stop campaigning goes back over a century in America but in recent decades politicians have tried to emulate the legendary 1948 tour that Harry Truman rode to an improbable come-from-behind election.</p>
<p>Clinton hopes the train tour will generate some excitement and momentum going into Chicago and help negate a rise in the polls by Republican Bob Dole on the strength of the Republican convention in San Diego.</p>
<p>The president plans to make news with some policy initiatives almost every day -- anti-crime on Monday, education on Tuesday and the environment on Wednesday, to add to a string of major bill-signings last week that kept him in the public eye.</p>
<p>Presidential aides said Clinton on Monday will propose to expand the reach of the Brady Bill handgun control law to prevent people convicted of domestic violence from buying guns. It now prevents fugitives, felons and stalkers from buying them.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Mike McCurry estimated the total cost of the initiatives Clinton will unveil during the train trip at $8 billion.</p>
<p>The crowd in this coal-mining region spilled off the grounds of the train station and gave an enthusiastic welcome to Clinton, his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea as they began their journey under a cloudless blue sky.</p>
<p>&quot;All Aboard for Clinton-Gore,&quot; said one sign waved by a Clinton supporter.</p>
<p>Clinton told them his economic policies have caused the national budget deficit to drop four years in a row for the first time since the 1840s, generated 10 million new jobs, helped 4.5 million people buy new homes and 10 million refinance their mortages at lower interest rates.</p>
<p>He skewered Republicans for shutting the government down last winter in a budget fight and for trying to block his efforts to preserve spending for education and the environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall we keep going on the right track or turn around?&quot; said Clinton, his voice confident and booming. &quot;Would you take a U-turn if you were going in the right direction?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; yelled the crowd.</p>
<p>With Clinton was Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a wealthy West Virginian who decried Dole's plans for a 15-percent, across-the-board tax cut he said would mainly help the rich. &quot;I don't need it,&quot; he said to cheers.</p>
<p>Clinton was wearing a red, white and blue tie with American flags and donkeys on it. He said it had been given to him by his barber Sunday morning. &quot;Figured I should wear it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The president and his immediate entourage were travelling in two vintage &quot;office cars&quot; at the tail end of the 13-car, three-engine train. Clinton's car is the Georgia 300, also named the General Polk. The luxury car frequently carried President Franklin Roosevelt to his summer vacation home in Warm Springs, Ga.</p>
<p>The second office car is the Missouri-Kansas-Texas 403, used by Truman during his 1948 tour.</p>
