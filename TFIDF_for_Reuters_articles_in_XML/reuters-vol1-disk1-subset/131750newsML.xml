<p>Falling wheat prices hovered perilously close to four dollars a bushel for the first time since June on Monday as the United States pleaded with Europe not to engage in a damaging subsidy war.</p>
<p>Prices, which only six months ago hit a record of $7.50 a bushel, have slumped as farmers continue to reap big harvests and competition heats up between exporters, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are falling because a lot of exports are getting done quietly by Australia and Canada. They are fighting for business,&quot; a leading European Union grain exporter said.</p>
<p>Benchmark Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures for December fell 6.25 cents to $4.04-3/4 on Friday. On Monday electronic dealing screens in Asia were showing a further loss to $4.03.</p>
<p>In dollars per tonne paid by importers, that equates to $159 a tonne compared with a record near $300 in April when markets were panicked by a drop in stocks to 20-year lows.</p>
<p>Bumper harvests in western Europe, to be followed soon by hefty crops in Argentina and Australia, have made the world's benchmark price traded in Chicago seem expensive to buyers.</p>
<p>Argentine wheat is currently quoted at $143 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said much now depended on how the United States and European Union managed to weather the extra price competition.</p>
<p>The trading powers on both sides of the Atlantic, still nursing wounds from a 1980s subsidy war, have so far avoided a new brawl for market share by maintaining a premium over wheat from other origins.</p>
<p>But the United States voiced new worries on Sunday that the EU might undercut U.S. farmers and compete head-on with Argentina for sales by using subsidies.</p>
<p>&quot;We would consider that fairly aggressive,&quot; Agriculture Undersecretary Gene Moos told Reuters during a visit to a Paris food fair. Such a step would force Washington to consider restoring its own subsidies to protect its farmers, he said.</p>
<p>The EU irritated Washington by bringing back limited wheat export subsidies last month after a 16-month pause while prices boiled. But it appears to have smoothed relations for the time being by pledging not to undercut U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>Domestically, however, pressure is piling on EU authorities in Brussels to sell the near-record EU wheat harvest of 90 million tonnes more actively or face an internal price slump.</p>
<p>&quot;If they are not more aggressive we will see the price fall and five or six million tonnes will go into intervention,&quot; one exporter said, referring to the EU's costly storage mechanism for wheat when it falls below guaranteed support prices.</p>
<p>EU analysts say the European Commission, which effectively markets all grain from the 15-nation bloc, is anxious not to see its silos filled with another unwanted &quot;grain mountain&quot;.</p>
<p>That would wipe out hard-won farm reforms designed to make farmers less dependent on storage while also straining a tight EU farm budget under attack from the cost of mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Countering Argentine competition would require current EU wheat export subsidies of about $10 per tonne to be trebled and risk provoking a hostile trade reaction from Washington.</p>
<p>To allow itself to export more grain without having to increase export assistance, the Commission has taken the rare step of telling its own farmers to drive down prices at home.</p>
<p>&quot;High domestic prices are holding up EU exports,&quot; a Commission source told Reuters in Brussels on Monday.</p>
<p>On the world market, traders said prices were slowly getting into balance but any signs that Brussels or Washington were stepping up subsidies would be a signal for speculators to act.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't a great deal of scope for prices to keep going down on their own but you have to remember the funds are there,&quot; said one exporter. Prices could sway for some months until the progress of next year's crop gave solid new direction, he said.</p>
