<headline>KL shares end higher as Iraq news shrugged off.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Share prices bounced from Tuesday's skid as players shrugged off a second U.S. missile attack on Iraq, traders said.</p>
<p>After initial caution, players returned to the buying side as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has retaliated only with words. &quot;There's renewed confidence as the confrontation was not as severe as initially thought,&quot; said Victor Wan, senior analyst at South Johore Securities.</p>
<p>The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index ended up 12.10 points or 1.11 percent to 1,105.42. The index fell 12.88 points on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Blue chips which returned to the black include Telekom, Tanjong, Maybank, UMW and Proton which gained between 15 and 50 cents.</p>
<p>Punters also resumed their activities on secondaries, driving the Second Board index up 19.43 points to 542.00.</p>
<p>Speculative buying pushed up stocks linked to businessman Vincent Tan, traders said. Top gainer Unza jumped 6.05 to 26.25 ringgit on asset reshuffling rumours.</p>
<p>Other Tan-linked counters which jumped include Bridgecon, Berjaya Group, Berjaya Industrial and Hospital Pantai, rising between 16 cents and 1.40 ringgit.</p>
