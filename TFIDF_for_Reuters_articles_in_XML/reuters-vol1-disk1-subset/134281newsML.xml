<headline>Digital posts $66 million loss.</headline>
<dateline>MAYNARD, Mass. 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Digital Equipment Corp. said Tuesday it posted a deeper-than-expected loss of $66 million in its fiscal first quarter amid continued disappointing sales, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>The computer manufacturer said it recorded a loss of $65.9 million, or 48 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $48.2 million, or 26 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The per-share loss was more than three times the 14 cents that Wall Street was expecting, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Digital's stock, which did not immediately begin trading when the New York Stock Exchange opened, plunged $1.875 to $32.50 when it began trading.</p>
<p>Digital, with a disproportionate share of its sales in Europe, which has been hit by an economic slowdown, said operating revenues dropped to $2.91 billion from $3.27 billion.</p>
<p>The company, based in Maynard, Mass., also said its gross profit margin fell to 31.3 percent of revenues from 32.2 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Digital said it continues to work on improving its sales organisation, one of the factors that led to losses in its European business. It recently put its entire worldwide enterprise sales force under one management.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concentrating on substantive, permanent improvement, not quick fixes,&quot; Chairman Robert Palmer said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The turnaround that we continue to manage is challenging and extensive in scope,&quot; Palmer added. &quot;Despite progress we have achieved in the last two years, these results simply are not where they should be.&quot;</p>
<p>Digital said it needed to implement a new sales model that would eventually increase the extent and effectiveness of its account coverage, but because of the changes, its first quarter got off &quot;to an even more sluggish start.&quot;</p>
<p>Sales of its Alpha system were up 4 percent, a more modest growth rate that was a direct result of the changes and realignments in its sales organisation.</p>
<p>Digital said its service revenues were $1.38 billion, down from $1.45 billion a year ago. Service gross margins were 31.5 percent of revenues, down from 33.8 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Product gross profits were 31.1 percent, versus 30.9 percent.</p>
<p>Digital's chief financial officer, Vincent Mullarkey, said that the company made solid progress in the management of gross margins and operating expenses, despite its revenue shortfall. Total operating expenses were essentially unchanged at $900 million in the quarter.</p>
<p>Digital said that the performance of its personal computer business continued to improve and the unit made good progress toward its near-term business objectives, although analysts said the PC unit was still struggling.</p>
<p>Industry-wide price cuts in personal computers earlier this year and an inventory build-up hurt Digital's personal computer unit in its fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Enrico Pesatori, head of the personal computer unit and heir apparent to Chief Executive Palmer, suddenly resigned in early July, citing distribution problems.</p>
<p>Palmer told reporters and analysts in late July that the PC unit would break even, or even be profitable, by the end of the traditionally stronger second quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it ended the quarter with about 57,000 employees, a reduction of 4,500 positions from a year ago and 2,100 fewer than at the end of fiscal 1996.</p>
