<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat within two weeks, Israel radio said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;As of now, President (Ezer) Weizman, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will meet within two weeks with Yasser Arafat,&quot; Israel radio said.  </p>
<p>Israel's state-run television said that Netanyahu would most likely meet Arafat before travelling to the United States on September 10.</p>
<p>It said the meeting had been agreed upon during talks between PLO official Abu Mazen and Netanyahu adviser Dore Gold. Since his May election Netanyahu has refused to meet Arafat, saying he will do so only when he deems it necessary for Israel's security.</p>
<p>Weizman said earlier on Sunday that he would invite Arafat to his home but set no date.</p>
<p>The Israeli president said Arafat had sent him a letter &quot;in which he spelled out his troubles and problems and said 'I hope we will meet soon'&quot;.</p>
