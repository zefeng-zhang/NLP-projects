<p>Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) has published its proposed regulations for the establishment of a new fund structure, Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) in 1997.</p>
<p>The draft is the result of consultations since 1995 with industry professionals and UK tax authorities and aims to create a collective investment vehicle which can be marketed from Britain into Europe under the 1985 UCITS Directive, which allows for cross-border operations of such funds.</p>
<p>&quot;Both choice and competitiveness are being enhanced,&quot; SIB chairman Sir Andrew Large said in a statement with the proposals, which should clear parliament by February 1997.</p>
<p>Final comments from the industry may be submitted until the end of November and industry sources said the first OEICs could be offered to the UK market before April.</p>
<p>Eventually OEICs will replace unit trusts but a recent survey showed just one-third of managers currently running unit trusts are interested in converting to OEICs.</p>
<p>SIB said it has six months to approve each application for an OEIC registration, but with the help of a model form prepared by the UK unit trust trade body AUTIF, expects to clear most applications in six weeks.</p>
<p>The new fund type will aim to rival Luxembourg UCITS and French SICAV funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities have supported OEICs because they are interested in trying to win back onshore some of the business that has drifted offshore to Luxembourg and Dublin in the last few years,&quot; said a fund manager.</p>
<p>&quot;The umbrella structure of OEICs, offering different classes of shares (like UCITS and SICAVs) is well liked, partly because administration costs are less,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>According to fund consultants Fitzrovia International, Dublin has attracted some 19 billion stg worth of UCITS (funds similar to OEICs).</p>
<p>In Luxembourg, the main offshore centre for German investors, business is estimated to top 80 billion stg.</p>
<p>OEICs have been closely modelled on UK unit trusts (closed end funds) but have some critical differences. They will offer a single mid-market price rather than a bid-offer spread, and a corporate structure will allow them to borrow.</p>
<p>SIB said the over-riding principle behind the regulations had been the need to ensure that investors are protected.</p>
<p>OEICs will offer enhanced disclosure, with each fund having an &quot;authorised corporate director&quot; operating the company under regulations supervised by SIB, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA, for marketing functions) and the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO, overseeing fund management).</p>
<p>Each OEIC must also appoint a &quot;depositary&quot; or trustee, responsible for the safekeeping of the scheme's property and for ensuring key reulations are complied with.</p>
<p>In the foreword to the proposed regulations, SIB noted that the recent scandal involving two onshore unit trusts at Morgan Grenfell had &quot;inevitably raised questions about the regime in the UK for collective investment schemes, and the regulators are accordingly reviewing a range of issues&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage it does not look as though any major changes are required to the product regulations for unit trusts, though specific topics being reviewed include the limits on investment in unlisted securities, the valuation of unlisted securities and the relevant responsibilites of the manager and trustee (including obligations to report to the regulator).&quot;</p>
<p>SIB said that any amendments as a result of the review will be carried over to OEICs regulations &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.</p>
