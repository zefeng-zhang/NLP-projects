<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian truckers's strike continues unabated.</title>
<headline>Colombian truckers's strike continues unabated.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>A truckers' strike that has shut down Colombia's export industries entered its ninth day on Tuesday amid reports that drivers were blocking highways to press their demands for more pay.</p>
<p>Government officials said on Monday that truckers, who began their work stoppage at midnight on Oct. 13, were gradually returning to work to avert the threat of having their operators' licenses revoked.</p>
<p>But spokesmen for the Colombian Truck Drivers Association (ACC), the federation representing around 90,000 drivers that organised the strike, said it remained in full force.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety percent of all (cargo) transportation is paralysed,&quot; ACC spokesman Alfredo Cuervo said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>He said truckers in some areas converted their tractor- trailers into makeshift barricades to block transit along key highways and added that about 20 truckers had been jailed since Monday for participating in street protests to press their demands for higher wages and lower taxes and tolls.</p>
<p>&quot;People are running out of patience,&quot; Cuervo said.</p>
<p>Police sources said highways had been blocked in at least four provinces by truckers using nails in some cases to make them impassable. The Transporation Ministry, meanwhile, said up to 45 arrests had been made and that more than 200 trucks had been seized by the authorities.</p>
<p>Radio reports said the strike had begun to affect manufacturing activity since many factories were running out of raw materials.</p>
<p>Coffee has been the hardest hit sector of the economy so far, since no shipments have been dispatched to Colombia's ports since the strike began.</p>
<p>Jorge Cardenas, head of the National Coffee Growers Federation, told reporters he hoped the strike would be settled by November. Until it is, he said the world's No. 2 coffee exporter was basically out of business since the industry had been &quot;totally paralysed.&quot;</p>
<p>Cardenas said the shipment of 250,000 132-pound (60 kg) bags of green coffee promised for delivery to export clients in October had been delayed indefinitely by the strike.</p>
<p>That is about 25 percent of the one million bags Colombia had planned to export during the month.</p>
<p>Private exporters said another 250,000 bags planned for export in early November would also be delayed, whether or not the strike is settled before month-end, because of the enormous backlog that has developed at Colombia's ports.</p>
