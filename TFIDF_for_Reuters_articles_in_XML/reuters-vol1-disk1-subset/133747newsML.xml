<p>MGE spring wheat futures settled mostly lower and near their new contract lows, but traders said commercial buying supported the December contract over deferred months, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing the same thing day after day -- good commercial buying on the breaks. That's what's keeping us rangebound,&quot; a Minneapolis broker said.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat markets were weaker Tuesday after the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics revised upward its estimate of 1996/97 Australian wheat production.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat settled eight cents a bushel lower to 3/4 cent higher, with December up 3/4 cent at $4.10-1/4. The Dec/March inverted spread widened to 13-1/2 cents from 12-1/2. March ended 3/4 cent lower at $3.96 but above its new low set during the day at $3.93-1/2. May and July also set new lows.</p>
<p>Traders said Wilson bought 2.5 million Dec bushels. LFG bought 600,000 each of Dec and March and sold 800,000 March and Atwood/Peavey bought 1.0 million March and sold 1.5 million Dec.</p>
<p>MGE barley futures closed three to five cents per cwt higher, with Dec up three cents at $6.80.</p>
