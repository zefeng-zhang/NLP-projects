<p>British Airways Chief Executive Bob Ayling warned the European Commission on Tuesday to keep planned reforms to airport slot allocation rules as simple as possible, saying restrictions would be arbitrary and were likely to be unworkable.</p>
<p>Ayling described as &quot;encouraging&quot; that the planned slot reform proposal by European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock looked likely to endorse the legitimacy of secondary slot trading.</p>
<p>&quot;I would urge (Kinnock) to keep the new form of regulation as simple as he conceivably can. Avoid restrictions on the trading of slots, which are bound to be arbitrary and likely to be frustrated,&quot; Ayling said in the draft of a speech released to reporters ahead of delivery to a Brussels aviation industry lunch.</p>
<p>The European Commission is due, before the end of the year, to review slot allocation rules in the hope of tidying up the so-called grey market for allocated slots in which ailrines sell take-off and landing slots.</p>
<p>The EU executive has excluded any significant changes to the initial slot allocation process.</p>
<p>Interest in the Commission's work amongst airports and airlines is heightened by the possibility that legitimised slot trading will allow slot holders to write in a book value for assets which were previously difficult to quantify.</p>
