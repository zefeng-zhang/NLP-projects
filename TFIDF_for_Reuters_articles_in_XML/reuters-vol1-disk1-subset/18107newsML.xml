<p>A weak survey of Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar on Wednesday and European bourses were mixed, with London and Frankfurt up, helped by a firm Wall Street, but Paris down on currency and strike worries.</p>
<p>At 1100 GMT the dollar was trading at around 108.38 yen, up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 after the Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey, or &quot;tankan&quot;, showed the diffusion index for major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment -- falling to minus seven in August from minus three in the previous survey in May.</p>
<p>The unexpected figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen. The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year.</p>
<p>A BOJ spokesman said &quot;the doors to the recovery have not been shut...the recovery is still continuing.&quot; These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to build on its gains.</p>
<p>Dealers said it would be hard for the dollar to break higher against the yen and it was likely to trade in narrow ranges for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's gains were less than spectacular, suggesting that while it's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations, a breakout from the established trading range doesn't appear likely,&quot; said currency economist Klaus Baader.</p>
<p>On the European bourses, London shares added to early gains boosted by Wall Street. They climbed from the start, with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3,919.7 early in the day before dropping back slightly.</p>
<p>One focus was British Airways, which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of &quot;open skies&quot; talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines.</p>
<p>The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt firmer German debt and the higher close on Wall Street overnight gave German equities a boost early on, but dealers said the soft dollar/mark still weighed on sentiment.</p>
<p>By contrast French stocks opened lower and extended their losses to more than one percent in morning trading, falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main CAC-40 index. Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes</p>
<p>Louis Viannet, leader of France's Communist-led CGT union, criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays.</p>
<p>Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production, showing the economy was still faltering.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 108.35 yen and 1.4785 marks compared with Tuesday's European close of 107.78 yen and 1.4779 marks</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had risen 8.3 points to 3,914.0.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index dropped 21.02 to 1,996.97.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was up 5.31 at 2,564.15.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $388.65 versus $388.55 at Tuesday's  London close. Silver was at $5.23, down a cent.</p>
