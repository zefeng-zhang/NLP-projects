<p>Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will resume her regular weekend speeches to supporters in response to the government's lifting of a blockade near her home, a supporter said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government on Monday removed the blockades barring access to University Avenue, the road on which Suu Kyi's house is located, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is ready to resume the weekend talks as soon as the situation permits,&quot; the National League for Democracy (NLD) party source said.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace laureate has been prevented from giving regular speeches outside her front gates for the last four consecutive weekends because the military government has blockaded the road leading to her house.</p>
<p>The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) said the barricades, which had been manned by heavily-armed soldiers for 10 days, were set up to prevent unrest.</p>
<p>The blockades were also in place from September 26 to October 8 to stop the NLD from holding a September 27-29 party congress.</p>
<p>Diplomats said on Tuesday they expect the SLORC will continue to put up the blockades on the weekends to prevent the speeches outside Suu Kyi's house.</p>
<p>The SLORC has said the gatherings are illegal but Suu Kyi said earlier this month she would hold them in any case because they were the only way she was able to speak to supporters.</p>
<p>The NLD won a landslide victory in a 1990 election, but was never allowed to take power because the SLORC refused to acknowledge the results of the poll.</p>
