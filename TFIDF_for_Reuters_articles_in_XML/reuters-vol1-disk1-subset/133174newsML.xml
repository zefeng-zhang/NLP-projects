<p>Gazprom dominated an otherwise quiet share Russian share market on Tuesday, rising strongly after announcing a price of $15.75 for its American Depositary Shares, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gazprom was one of the day's strongest gainers and the most active by turnover, with $5.85 million of shares changing hands on the Russian Trading System -- one third of total volume.</p>
<p>It closed at $0.505, off an early $0.530 high, after closing on Monday at $0.480. One ADS is equivalent to 10 shares.</p>
<p>A trader at Troika-Dialog said the Russian market was not much affected by the news as the domestic and international markets were separated.</p>
<p>According to Gazprom rules, foreigners cannot buy cheap Russian shares on the domestic market, while Russian operators cannot buy shares on the international market.</p>
<p>Gazprom bids rose to $0.500 on Tuesday, but there were many sellers at that level, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the shares could rise further.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of all Russian shares Gazprom has the biggest potential from the point of view of its quotes growth, but when the rise will happen I cannot say,&quot; said the Troika trader.</p>
<p>Other leading shares closed mixed on Tuesday in weak and low volume trading.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 24 shares fell by 0.16 percent to 183.72 on $17.73 million in volume.</p>
<p>Sergei Kosynkin, head of trading at Bank Menatep, said almost all shares now looked expensive, besides Norilsk Nickel, which could grow another 10-15 percent.</p>
<p>Norilsk Nickel rose to $6.40 from $6.39.</p>
<p>Tatneft was one of the losers of the day with prices falling to $36.50 from $36.75.</p>
<p>The company announced on Monday that it had paid most of its tax arrears. Last week the government said it would start a bankruptcy suit, if Tatneft did not pay taxes soon.</p>
<p>Troika-Dialog trader said the news would only have an impact in a few days.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a time lag between news and decisions by investors in second-tier shares,&quot; he said.</p>
