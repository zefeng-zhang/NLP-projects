<p>The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane warning likely would be issued Wednesday evening for a portion of the southeast U.S. coast as powerful Hurricane Fran moved northwest through the Atlantic.</p>
<p>At 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, Fran's center was near latitude 27.7 north and longitude 75.6 west, or about 445 miles (716 km) southeast of Charleston, S.C., and moving northwest near 12 mph (19 kmh), a track expected to continue Wednesday night.  </p>
<p>Maximum sustained winds were near 115 mph (185 kmh) with higher gusts and forecasters said some strengthening was possible. Fran is a huge storm, with hurricane force winds reaching up to 175 miles (280 km) from its center and tropical storm force winds extending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) mainly to the northeast.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was in effect for the northwestern Bahamas islands of Abaco, Grand Bahama, Eleuthera, Bimini and Berry and a tropical storm warning was in effect for the northwestern Bahamas islands of Andros and New Providence, as Fran passed parallel and to the north of the island chain.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch was in effect from north of Sebastian Inlet, Florida, to Oregon Inlet, North Carolina, including Pamlico Sound.</p>
<p>&quot;A hurricane warning is likely to be issued this evening or tonight for a portion of the watch areas. Residents should heed advice from local emergency management officials,&quot; the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
