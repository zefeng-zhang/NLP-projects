<title>UK: NWE heating oil premiums unchanged, diesel firm.</title>
<headline>NWE heating oil premiums unchanged, diesel firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil prices eased on Tuesday, pushed down by easier IPE futures, but premiums were steady despite abundant heating oil supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Nov IPE futures were trading at $230.25, down $4 on unusually mild weather in Europe as well as news from the U.S. that two refineries are increasing distillate production.</p>
<p>Heating oil premiums were unchanged despite reluctance from buyers with little need to act because of the mild weather. Traders said most wholesalers had settled their requirements until the end of the month.</p>
<p>They said German winter grade cargoes were offered at Nov IPE +$6/5.50 and bid at +$4/5 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel winter grade cargoes were offered at around Nov IPE +$27/31. Intermediate grade was discussed around Nov +$26/25 into France for Nov 1-10.</p>
<p>Traders said more refiners were producing diesel, implying easier supply in early November.</p>
<p>One trader said the heating oil arbitrage from the U.S. was marginally closed and no more material from there could be expected unless the cash differentials in the U.S. Gulf weaken much further.</p>
<p>On the barge market, refinery grade heating oil was traded unchanged at Nov IPE +$2 and intermediate grade low sulphur diesel was done at Nov IPE +$35, slightly firmer than on Monday. -- William Maclean, London newsroom +44 171 542 7646</p>
