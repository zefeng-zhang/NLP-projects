<p>Base metal traders said on Tuesday the arrest and prosecution for forgery of Sumitomo Corp's dismissed chief copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka would have little impact on the copper market.</p>
<p>&quot;What difference will it make?&quot; Vinod Kumar, director of Singapore-based metal company Donald Mcarthy, told Reuters. &quot;Whatever has been done cannot be undone. It should have no impact, absolutely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hamanaka hasn't been in the pit since he was sacked in June, so he has no impact on the market,&quot; a metals dealer in Sydney said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hamanaka affair is over as far as the market is concerned. The market will just ignore this,&quot; a dealer in a Japanese metal trading company agreed.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Tokyo told reporters Hamanaka, fired last June for his role in Sumitomo's estimated $2.6 billion copper trading loss, was arrested on Tuesday on two counts of forging documents for use in trading non-ferrous metals.  </p>
<p>&quot;After everything else is settled, now they launch a raid?&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Far East metal traders said the market was paying attention more to the possibility of another large drawdown in copper stocks similar to the 19,125-tonne fall in the LME report last Friday.</p>
<p>In London on Tuesday, LME copper stocks went down by 13,075 tonnes while aluminium stocks fell by 2,875 tonnes.</p>
<p>Three month copper prices were stable around $1,960 a tonne in London in early trade on Tuesday. Copper had been quoted at around $1,960/65 a tonne by Singapore metal traders at 0800 GMT.</p>
<p>Aluminium prices in London were stable just above $1,350 a tonne, little changed from the $1,350/55 a tonne quoted in Singapore at about 0800 GMT, metal dealers said.</p>
