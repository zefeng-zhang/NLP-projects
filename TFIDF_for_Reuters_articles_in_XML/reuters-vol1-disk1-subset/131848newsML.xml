<headline>RTRS-Result of ANI meeting to be known Monday.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian National Industries Ltd said it should know some time later on Monday the result of an election calling for the removal of two directors.</p>
<p>The chairman of the heavy engineering firm, Ted Harris, told reporters after the annual meeting the result of the election should bring stability to the company's board of directors.</p>
<p>Harris said he could not comment on whether managing director Peter Stancliffe would remain with the company if rebel director Ross Palmer was re-elected to the board.</p>
<p>Palmer has the largest personal shareholding in ANI with a stake of five percent.  </p>
<p>His re-election has been opposed by fellow director Peter Joseph, who in turn is being opposed by Palmer.</p>
<p>Palmer has become a minority voice on the board since his decision last month to publicly reveal that he was in charge of an investigation over the purchase of a business by ANI's German subsidiary, Holter, of another environmental engineering business, ABT.</p>
<p>Harris and Stancliffe have supported the re-election of Joseph, who has the supported of most institutional investors in ANI. The re-election votes require a majority of 50.1 percent, with institutions holding more than 68 percent of the company.</p>
