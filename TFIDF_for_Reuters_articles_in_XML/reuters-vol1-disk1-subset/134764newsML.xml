<headline>Clinton sets 1999 target for new NATO members.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he wants NATO to admit its first new members by 1999, the first time he has backed a target date for an expansion of the alliance expected to begin with former Soviet bloc states.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, I want to state America's goal: By 1999 - NATO's 50th anniversary and 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- the first group of countries we invite to join should be full-fledged members of NATO,&quot; Clinton said.  </p>
<p>Clinton, speaking at a U.S. election campaign rally as NATO begins the process of incorporating new members, did not name specific countries. But alliance members see Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as heading the queue.</p>
<p>He said NATO's doors would remain open to others after the first new members were accepted, adding: &quot;NATO will remain open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to shoulder the responsibilities of membership. No nation will be automatically excluded. No country outside NATO will have a veto.&quot;</p>
<p>In a clear effort to reassure Russia, Clinton said NATO's enlargement was not directed against anyone and would enhance the security of members and non-members. He called for a formal cooperation agreement between Russia and NATO and said: &quot;We should set up a mechanism for regular NATO-Russia meetings at all levels.&quot;</p>
<p>North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ministers are to meet in December to pave the way for a summit of the 16 alliance members in 1997 that would name the first candidates for membership and lead to the opening of negotiations.</p>
