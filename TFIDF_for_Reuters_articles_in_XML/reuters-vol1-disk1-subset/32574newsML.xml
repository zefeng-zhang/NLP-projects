<headline>IBM launches electronic commerce products.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>International Business Machines Corp on Wednesday introduced electronic commerce technologies aimed at making itself a one-stop shop for doing business on the Internet's World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The package of electronic commerce products and services, dubbed CommercePOINT, is designed to provide end-to-end buying and selling over the multimedia portion of the Internet.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunity here goes beyond forging transactions on the Internet,&quot; Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's Internt Division, told reporters at a news conference in a downtown San Francisco hotel.  </p>
<p>IBM said its complete end-to-end services product would be based on a monthly fee, or individual applications could be purchased a la carte as businesses purchase and install them.</p>
<p>The move follows an embarrassment over IBM's running of the Web site for the Atlanta Olympic Committee during the 1996 Summer Games, during which a major snafu resulted in delays and inaccurate data during the opening days of the event.</p>
<p>At its announcement here, IBM rolled out a number of customers who provided testaments to their confidence in doing business with the world's largest computer company.  </p>
<p>The company said its CommercePOINT initiative would provide &quot;the most complete and secure infrastructure&quot; for credit and debit card stransactions from consumer to merchant to band and from purchase to payment to reconciliation.</p>
<p>IBM said it supports Secure Electronic Transaction, or SET, a standard backed by a consortium of industry leaders, including IBM, Mastercard, Microsoft Corp, and Visa.</p>
<p>The company said customers such as mail order outfitter L.L. Bean were already developing some 40 &quot;smart catalogs&quot; which are desplayed electronically and can continually rearranged based on customers' preferences.  </p>
<p>Net.Commerce runs on Microsoft's Windows NT and IBM's AIX version of Unix and on processors from Intel Corp Pentiums to supercomputers. IBM said it will be available worldwide from the fourth quarter starting at $5,000.</p>
<p>Net.Commerce is one of what IBM described as &quot;three flavors&quot; of CommercePOINT services nd products it said would be available to businesswes &quot;which need to reach customers in tempting new ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The three variations let retailers go it alone, provide some handholding from IBM or offer a coplete outsourcing arrangement,&quot; the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>IBM said it was offering two service offerings -- World Avenue, an on-line Web mall offering a secure way to sell goods and services to millions of customers, and World Commerce, for businesses who want a private, stand-alone merchant site without having to create and manage it.</p>
<p>IBM said World Avenue will have its grand opening this fall, with two retailers already opened for business and a total of 20 expected to be up and running by opening day.</p>
<p>World Commerce is available on a limited basis directly from IBM beginning in the fourth quarter of this year at prices which depend on customer requirements.  </p>
<p>IBM said it was also offering a low monthly fee and installation charge for World Distributor, a service offering tying retailers, franchisers, suppliers and other key venders, starting on a limited basis in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>World Purchasing will be available in the fourth quarter for large businesses and governments which do contractual buying and selling for major items, such as electrity.</p>
<p>The company is also offering Net.Commerce Payment in the same time period to provide implementation at a consumer's browser, a merchant's server and a bank's processor.</p>
<p>Customers applauded IBM's initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn't your Dad's IBM anymore,&quot; said Steve Mott, head of electronic commerce and new ventures at Mastercard during a testimonial on what he called IBM's &quot;steadfast and statesmanlike role...This IBM is lean and mean,&quot; he added.</p>
