<p>Crude oil prices in Asia jumped to fresh four-month highs on Tuesday after the United States launched a cruise missile strike on Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi military attacks on Kurds in the north of the country.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said the attack was made against air defence command and control military targets in and around Baghdad.</p>
<p>The benchmark U.S. light crude oil for October delivery rose to $23.75 per barrel from $23.48 per barrel in the minutes that followed the Pentagon's announcement during Tokyo afternoon trade.</p>
<p>By late afternoon Tokyo, the October contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) had traded up to $24.00. During Asian trading hours, NYMEX crude oil contracts trade on the after-hours ACCESS system.</p>
<p>NYMEX October crude was at its highest level since April 22 and up $1.75 from Friday's close in New York. The New York market was closed on Monday for the U.S. Labor Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of crude oil could jump over $30 (per barrel) in the case of WTI,&quot; Kazuaki Kondo, a senior economist at the Japanese Institute of Middle Eastern Economies, told Reuters Financial Television following news of the U.S. missile attack against Baghdad.</p>
<p>North Sea Brent October crude, trading on the Singapore International Mercantile Exchange (SIMEX), jumped to $23.50 after the news, up from London's close of $21.99. In late Tokyo afternoon trade, the Brent contract was last traded at $23.00.</p>
<p>Oil traders said the market was being affected both by news of the escalating tensions and the fact that sales of Iraqi crude -- which they had expected to start in September -- were on hold.</p>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had put off plans to implement a $2 billion oil-for-food plan which would allow Iraq to export about 700,000 barrels of oil per day. This would have represented Iraq's return to oil markets after a six-year absence.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a short-term thing. The market will be volatile,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The fact that it came after a long weekend did not help. But if the oil sales are put back on track then prices will come off.&quot;</p>
<p>But traders said the tensions have come at a sensitive time for the United States.</p>
<p>Stocks of petroleum products such as heating oil and gasoline were at very low levels. In addition, Clinton faces a presidential election in November.</p>
