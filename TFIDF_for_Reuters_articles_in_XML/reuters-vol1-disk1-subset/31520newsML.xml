<p>Zimbabwe's civil servants threatened on Wednesday another stoppage unless the government negotiated outstanding demands by September 27, just hours after ending a two-week strike which crippled key social services.</p>
<p>&quot;Seven demands put us on the streets. It is the seven demands that will get us back on the streets. We are giving them until 27 September to start negotiations on those demands,&quot; Farai Jiya, a Public Service Association (PSA) union official, told reporters.</p>
<p>Besides their demands for higher salaries, the civil servants are pressing for extra pay for working over 40 hours a week, increases of various allowances as well as a review of the country's labour laws which they argue favour employers.</p>
<p>They returned to work on Wednesday after the government offered to reinstate thousands of strikers it had fired over the stoppage for higher pay which began on August 20 and left essential social services barely functioning.</p>
<p>The strikers -- who included doctors, nurses, mortuary attendants, prosecutors and firefighters -- had vowed to stay on the streets this week until the government guaranteed 7,000 workers it fired two weeks ago would get their jobs back.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Public Service Minister Florence Chitauro said President Robert Mugabe's government -- which held a marathon cabinet meeting on Tuesday to settle the dispute -- had decided to reinstate the dismissed workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Notwithstanding the fact that the civil servants took part in an illegal strike, government has now resolved that all the civil servants who had been dismissed be reinstated with effect from...the 4th of September,&quot; Chitauro said.</p>
<p>This is the second time in seven days that the government has climbed down from its tough position against the strike -- estimated by union officials to have been supported by 70 to 80 percent of Zimbabwe's 180,000 civil servants.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, it offered the strikers a 20 percent rise in addition to an original nine percent increase.</p>
<p>They had demanded increases of between 30 to 60 percent, arguing their salaries -- which average Z$1,000 (U.S.$98) a month -- had failed to keep up with annual inflation currently running at 22 percent.</p>
<p>A union official who declined to be named, said although the strikers were unhappy with the government's offer, they had decided to go back to work &quot;for the sake of the nation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not happy but we have agreed that the strike is over to make sure that we restore services,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The strike was a rare challenge to Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party who have ruled the southern African country virtually unchallenged since 1980 independence from Britain.</p>
<p>Hospitals were the hardest hit, with many around the country forced to close some wards. They handled emergencies only, using senior doctors helped by army and Red Cross medical personnel.</p>
