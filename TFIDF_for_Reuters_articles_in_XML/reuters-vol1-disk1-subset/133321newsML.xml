<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian stocks pushed up by foreign fund demand.</title>
<headline>Colombian stocks pushed up by foreign fund demand.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Colombian stocks edged up slightly on the back of thin trading driven by demand by foreign funds, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bogota's IBB index gained 0.54 percent to close at 872.55 on total trading of 708.4 million pesos. Medellin's IBOMED general price index headed up 0.15 percent to 13,660.49 on a thin 571.7 million peso volume.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes were lower, but there was demand by foreign funds for shares that are considered most stable and most tradeable,&quot; a broker said. &quot;Those funds are attracted by companies below book value and expected to post good results.&quot;  </p>
<p>The main movers on the Bogota exchange included Banco de Bogota, up 0.82 percent to 6,100 on a 338.68 million peso trade and brewing giant Bavaria, up 0.71 to 4,070 on a 155.71 million peso volume.</p>
<p>&quot;Brokers believe these two shares will post good results. Both are very stable and well-traded,&quot; another broker added.</p>
<p>Other highlights in Bogota included a 64.26 million peso deal in Banco de Colombia shares, down 0.24 percent at 415; Banco Industrial Colombiano, up 0.68 percent at 3,530 on 18.09 million pesos; and supermarket chain Cadenalco, up 1.21 percent to 916 on 11.17 million pesos.  </p>
<p>&quot;These shares are among the market leaders, but the volumes traded had no affect on the price index nor give reason to believe that the foreign funds were buying them up,&quot; another Bogota broker said.</p>
<p>In Medellin, Bavaria gained 0.74 percent to end the day at 4,060 on trading volume of 30.1 million pesos. Banco de Bogota closed 1.66 percent up at 6,100 on volume of 205 million.</p>
<p>Brokers also pointed out the 1.11 percent rise in Banco Ganadero ordinary shares to 273 pesos with 48.3 million pesos traded.</p>
