<p>Neutral Sweden, made to blush when it was revealed it had long mistaken swimming minks for Soviet submarines, turned a deeper shade of scarlet on Wednesday when Russia accused two Swedes of spying.</p>
<p>An embarrassed silence descended over one of Europe's most open governments after allegations erupted in the Russian media that a Swedish defence worker and a senior diplomat in Moscow had been caught spying and expelled from the country.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Goran Persson cut short a visit to neighbouring Denmark. His staff said the change was because of urgent labour market talks back in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Even Swedish parliamentary leaders protested that they had been kept in the dark about the allegations.</p>
<p>Russian media said 32-year-old Hans Peter Nordstrem had been arrested in St. Petersburg, Russia's second city, in February as he took a roll of film from a Russian contact and handed him money.</p>
<p>Swedish television news broadcast footage it said showed the Swede -- who is employed by Swedish defence company Celsius -- being arrested in a St. Petersburg museum and hustled away by men dressed in civilian clothes.</p>
<p>Nordstrem, interviewed by Swedish television, protested his innocence. &quot;Someone has tried to trick me. The person I was doing business with wasn't who he appeared to be.&quot;</p>
<p>Swedish officials declined all comment on the matter. &quot;I have no comment to make,&quot; a subdued Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen told Swedish television.</p>
<p>A colleague at Celsius told Swedish radio Nordstrem was involved in work with the Swedish jet fighter Jas Gripen.</p>
<p>Russian media said a senior diplomat at Sweden's Moscow embassy had also been expelled after the man was caught spying.</p>
<p>The Russian Interfax news agency quoted Boris Kostenko, head of the information department of the Federal Security Service, as saying the man caught in St. Petersburg was a Swedish military intelligence agent.</p>
<p>&quot;He confirmed that last winter Hans Peter Nordstrem, a go-between for the Swedish military intelligence, and a Russian citizen who had been engaged by the intelligence earlier had been detained,&quot; Interfax said from Moscow.</p>
<p>Kostenko said diplomatic channels had been used after the investigation to make Sweden &quot;withdraw the senior diplomat from Russia&quot;.</p>
<p>Sweden has for many years carried out regular expulsions of Soviet diplomats from Stockholm, alleging wholesale spying on its military installations.</p>
<p>Stockholm says it does not engage in foreign espionage activities, a claim scoffed at by western intelligence experts, although they say Sweden's foreign espionage agents are few compared to bigger countries.</p>
<p>A former colleague of Nordstrem's at Sweden's military defence research organisation FOA said the man had been involved there in underwater hunts for Soviet submarines, most of which -- it transpired last year -- turned out to have been small minks swimming in Sweden's waters.</p>
<p>An abashed Swedish navy admitted its sonar operators had mistaken the trail of the tiny furry animals for a giant Soviet sub.</p>
