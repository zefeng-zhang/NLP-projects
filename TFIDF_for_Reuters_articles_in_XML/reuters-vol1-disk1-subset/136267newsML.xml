<p>Toyota Motor Credit Corp successfully expanded its investor base on Wednesday by setting a jumbo mark-denominated Euro-Asian bond, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of institutional investors in the Far East are interested in marks and have increased their foreign currency holdings,&quot; the Merrill Lynch syndicate manager said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased and could have sold more -- we sold nearly half the paper in the Far East and there was a strong bid from Switzerland,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The structure -- a 1.0 billion mark five-year bond listed in Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt and London -- was intended to get the best possible distribution for the borrower, syndicate officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;With EMU there issuers will compete in fewer currencies in a smaller market for the same investors. So the Euro-Asian structure is a good way to position an issuer,&quot; the syndicate manager at joint lead manager Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt said.</p>
<p>He said the bond was one of the few liquid benchmark mark bonds in the five-year sector since June.</p>
<p>Ontario and Sweden have also used the Euro-Asian structure.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg was the other lead manager on the deal which was issued off an EMTN Programme.</p>
<p>The bond was priced to yield five basis points over the 8.25 percent September 2001 Bund.</p>
<p>Some new issues traders said the paper was aggressively priced but there was good demand for corporate paper.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond is differentiated from the bulk of the other five-year mark deals that have been mostly retail-targeted and tightly priced,&quot; the syndicate manager at Merrill said.</p>
<p>Some traders said the deal put the five-year corporate mark sector under some pressure, although they were surprised at the pressure as retail investors tended to hold onto their bonds and not switch into fresh paper.</p>
