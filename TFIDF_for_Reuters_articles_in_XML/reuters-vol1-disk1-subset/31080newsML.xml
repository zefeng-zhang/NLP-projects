<p>United Technologies Corp's aero engine unit Pratt &amp; Whitney and its French partner Snecma on Wednesday detailed plans, first announced this April, to create a range of powerplants for regional passenger jets.</p>
<p>The overall engine outline has now been defined and presented to customers, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada president David Caplan told a news conference at the Farnborough airshow, and the two firms &quot;believe the market potential is significant&quot;.</p>
<p>However, he predicted that the venture would proceed with preparatory work without any specific orders from planemakers in mind until some time towards the middle of next year.  </p>
<p>&quot;The programme is geared to be able to deliver less than three and a half years from 'Go' -- and we'd expect a 'Go' from the middle of next year. That is, somebody would roll out an order probably at the time of the Paris airshow,&quot; Caplan added.</p>
<p>The three-and-a-half year timeframe would be &quot;well within the customers' requirements&quot;, he said, adding that the exact timetable for production would be dictated by the marketplace.</p>
<p>Caplan stressed that the turbofan engine range, designated SPW14, would not be a derivative of any existing product and would be &quot;the first engine specifically designed for the regional market by anyone&quot;.  </p>
<p>The family of engines will be in the 12,000 to 16,000 pound thrust range, for regional aircraft in the 58 to 90 passenger range, the firms said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Asked where he saw the likely market, Caplan replied that the alliance anticipated several thousand aircraft would require such engines, with leading prospects including Europe's AI(R) consortium and planemakers on &quot;the Pacific rim&quot;.</p>
<p>Citing what many aerospace suppliers here have described as an increasingly demanding customer environment, Caplan said the engine was meant to set &quot;new industry standards&quot; in fuel consumption, reliability and maintenance cost.  </p>
<p>He said he believed that a guaranteed performance of 10,000 hours &quot;out of the box&quot; was the sort of level needed by the regional market, where aircraft usage is normally intense.</p>
