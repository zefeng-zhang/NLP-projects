<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Monday that Australia's savings-investment imbalance was causing it a problem on the current account, which in turn was restricting the country's ability to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;...We need to grow the Australian economy at four percent plus over the long term to make the kind of economic development that we want in this country,&quot; Costello told a meeting of the Business Council of Australia in Sydney.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet we found every time that growth took off in Australia the current account deficit blew out and we were forced to pare it back,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we want to grow the Australian economy on a sustainable basis we've got to attack the underlying problem of our low savings ratios,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>He said the continual running of government deficits had been a major factor behind the savings-investment imbalance.</p>
<p>The Coalition government was determined to turn things around, as outlined in its August 20 budget, Costello said.</p>
<p>He also said the view of Australia and Australian inflation prospects was changing, noting that since the election on March 2 the yield differential between U.S. and Australian bonds had fallen 130 basis points.  </p>
<p>&quot;The view of Australia and Australian inflation prospects is changing ... we are bringing rewards,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>Australia had a budget deficit of A$10.3 billion in the year to June. The government is aiming for a deficit of A$5.65 billion in 1996/97 and hopes to have a small surplus by 1998/99.</p>
<p>The current account deficit for 1995/96 was A$20.54 billion. The government forecasts a deficit of A$20 billion for the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>In the year to June, year average annual consumer inflation was 4.2 percent. The government is forecasting 2.0 percent for the current fiscal year.  </p>
<p>Inflation figures for the September quarter are due on Wednesday.</p>
