<headline>FORECAST - Poll cuts Singapore 1996 GDP to +6.4 pct.</headline>

<p>Singapore's economy is likely to grow by only 6.4 percent this year, compared with 8.8 percent in 1995 and 10.2 percent in 1994, a Reuters' poll of leading financial institutions showed on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The result of the poll of 11 economists, carried out just after Monday's announcement of a surprise 6.2 percent fall in the city-state's non-oil exports in September, is 0.1 percentage point below a similar Reuters' poll conducted on October 18.</p>
<p>Monday's non-oil export figures were worse than expected and encouraged several economists to cut their forecasts for 1996 growth by as much as 0.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>The result of the latest Reuters' poll contrasts starkly with Singapore's most recent official 1996 forecast, restated by Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong as recently as September 24, of &quot;seven to eight percent&quot; growth for 1996.  </p>
<p>The poll left the average forecast for Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997 unchanged at 7.0 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Most economists polled said their recent downward revisions reflected the impact of this year's downturn in the global electronics industry, on which Singapore is heavily dependent.</p>
<p>Electronics and related products account for about half the city-state's industrial production and almost 60 percent of its non-oil exports.  </p>
<p>Monday's figures showed a 23.7 percent year-on-year fall in exports of telecommunication equipment and a 16.2 percent fall in exports of electrical machinery in September.</p>
<p>But economists said their lower growth forecasts also reflected a contraction in several other parts of Singapore's export-dependent economy.</p>
<p>Many economists said they had not had time to readjust fully their quarterly growth estimates in the light of the recent trade data but several shaved their forecasts by a few tenths of a percentage point.  </p>
<p>Most expected Singapore's GDP growth in the third quarter to average slightly over 3.0 percent year-on-year. Growth in the fourth quarter was expected to average 4.9 percent.  </p>
