<headline>RTRS - AWF raises forecast for Australian barley.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) raised its seventh forecast for Australia's 1996/97 (April/March) barley crop to 6.14 million tonnes from its sixth forecast of 5.96 million tonnes a month ago.</p>
<p>Conditions have been very favourable for Australian barley over the last month, the private forecaster said.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from the past 10 days, there has been a steady supply of rain and this has enabled the crop yields to approach the potential from the available growing period,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The harvest is due to commence in both Queensland and the northern areas of Western Austeralia, it said.  </p>
<p>An important factor for this year's barley production has been the absence so far of hot weather which would bring the grain filling process to a rapid close, AWF said.</p>
<p>Queensland, which has had to import barley from other states in recent years, will have a surplus of barley this year, at least of malting quality barley.</p>
<p>Some 40 percent of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) barley production could be malting quality.  </p>
<p>There have beeen some quality problems with the first harvested Queensland wheat but the areas where barley production is concentrated have crops that are less advanced and have been free of rainfall on ripe barley, AWF said.</p>
<p>In NSW, the long growing season throughout the state has produced high yield prospects with the protein levels expected to be within the range for malt classification, it said.</p>
<p>Victorian and South Australian crops were late sown then made poor progress until August but since then conditions have been excellent, particularly in the two Mallee areas with light sandy soils and on the sandy sils of the Eyre Peninsula.  </p>
<p>Heavy dressings of fertiliser have assisted in achieving high yields without increasing the level of protein, AWF said.</p>
<p>The malting percentage should be above 70 percent in Victoria and above 65 percent in South Australia.</p>
<p>But if growers leave their barley to complete the wheat harvest, the percentage of feed grade barley in the later deliveries could increase, AWF said.</p>
<p>Western Australia also had a late sowing this year.</p>
<p>The season is expected to be shorter than in South Australia and Victoria and this may mean more modest yields, AWF said.  </p>
<p>AWF's state crop forecasts, in million tonnes, and area estimates, in million hectares, are as follows-</p>
