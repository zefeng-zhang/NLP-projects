<p>Strong trading in cement stocks pushed Egyptian shares up by 0.35 percent on Sunday but brokers said a new client listing system slowed down activity.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority's (CMA) overall index rose 0.82 points to a new 17-month high of 234.29 while volume was an above-average 16.23 million pounds ($4.77 million).</p>
<p>Egyptian Tora Portland Cement was the best cement performer, closing 0.25 pounds higher at 55.00 after trading in more than 31,000 shares.</p>
<p>Suez Cement gained 0.53 pounds to close at 41.08 after more than 27,000 shares exchanged hands, while Amriyah Cement ended the day 0.15 pounds higher at 53.00 after trading in more than 20,000 shares.</p>
<p>The rarely-traded Shams Housing and Development was the day's busiest share, with more than 85,000 shares exchanging hands and closed the day 0.60 pounds higher at 11.00.</p>
<p>Brokers said the stock was boosted by rumours the government would offer shares of the majority state-owned firm to the public as part of its privatisation process.</p>
<p>Central Egypt Flour Mills continued to perfrom well, trading in more than 51,000 shares but it closed 0.22 pounds lower at 24.33.</p>
<p>Youssef Khalil, a broker with Delta Stockbrokers, said overall activity was slowed down by a new listing system by which brokers must list the names of the client at the end of each transaction.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms rose to 335.91 points from 335.17 points on Thursday while the index for the rarely traded &quot;closed firms also rose to 161.13 from 160.49 points.</p>
