<p>A Republican leader on Monday accused Delaware's governor of spousal abuse but the charges were denied late in the day by the governor's wife.</p>
<p>In a meeting with reporters in the governor's office, Martha Carper, wife of Gov. Thomas Carper, a Democrat who is seeking re-election for a second term, said, &quot;I am not an abused wife and my children have not been abused by their father ... and I have never been treated in an emergency room in my life ... I love my husband and he loves me.&quot;</p>
<p>She was responding to charges made by chairwoman Ann Stone of Washington, D.C.-based Republicans for Choice at a news conference earlier in the day that allegations of divorce and spousal abuse against Carper had &quot;been covered up for political reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>Stone alleged that if unspecified court documents were unsealed they would substantiate her story, but Mrs. Carper said no such documents exist.</p>
<p>Martha Carper married Thomas Carper in 1985 when he was a second-term congressman and they have two sons, aged 8 and 6.</p>
<p>Carper stayed away from his wife's news conference at her request, but in a statement he said, &quot;This kind of political smear is not only hurtful to me and my family, but also to Delawareans' confidence in the political process.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Carpers' request, the chief judge of the Delaware Family Court, Vincent Poppiti, issued a verifying order that there were &quot;no filings at any time in the Family Court regarding (Martha and Thomas Carper's) marriage.&quot; The court's proceedings are confidential.</p>
<p>But Stone made public on Monday for the first time a July 29, 1981, deposition in which Carper admitted slapping his first wife Diane. In 1982 the incident was a front page story in the New York Post.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a stupid thing to do and I realised it then, and regret it now. It caused some discoloration of her left eye and some puffiness,&quot; Carper testified in the deposition, adding, &quot;It wasn't the kind of thing that was enduring or really all that significant.&quot;</p>
<p>Carper's Republican opponent for governor, state treasurer Janet Rzewnicki, denied charges by Martha Carper and Democratic Party state chairman Gary Hindes that her campaign &quot;was responsible for&quot; Stone's trip to Delaware.</p>
