<p>Switzerland's proposed 5.5 billion Swiss franc federal budget deficit for 1997 could swell as high as seven billion if the economy remains stagnant next year, Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger said.</p>
<p>The budget is based on projections of 1.5 percent real economic growth and inflation of 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We thus used relatively optimistic assumptions. We do not now expect the economy to contract again next year,&quot; Villiger told reporters, adding zero growth could push the shortfall to seven billion francs.</p>
<p>The government forecast for the economy, which has contracted for six consecutive quarters, is at the high end of analysts' expectations that have turned increasingly bearish in light of the Swiss franc's persistent strength.</p>
<p>The Swiss National Bank sees gross domestic product rising 1.0 to 1.5 percent next year after shrinking an expected 0.5 percent in 1996. GDP rose a measly 0.1 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>The KOF think-tank puts 1997 growth at 0.9 percent and Union Bank of Switzerland at 0.8 percent, while the BAK group in Basle sees it rising 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>The draft budget, which normally is revised heavily as it makes its way through parliament, keeps spending practically unchanged at 44.00 billion, compared with the 43.97 billion budgeted for 1996.</p>
<p>It puts revenue at 38.47 billion, down from 39.92 billion, leaving a shortfall of 5.53 billion, or 1.47 percent of GDP for the federal government alone.</p>
<p>The 1996 deficit is budgeted at 4.05 billion, or some 1.11 percent of GDP, but Villiger said nine-month data indicated the actual gap could be 500 million to one billion francs wider.</p>
<p>Fiscal revenue stood at 26.58 billion in the first nine months. The planned 1996 total is 35.05 billion.</p>
<p>Villiger described the spending plan as a compromise between narrowing the deficit and providing some economic stimulus.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's proposal for 1997 addresses the conflict between medium-term efforts to balance the budget and short-term demands on economic policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Financial markets mostly shrugged off the budget proposal, which does not have the same impact in Switzerland as in other major industrialised countries because of the relatively large importance of finance at the cantonal and local community level.</p>
