<headline>COFFEE - Delays feared in Colombian exports.</headline>

<p>A chaotic combination of leftist guerrillas, crumbling infrastructure and trucker protests could cause serious delays in getting Colombian coffee to port in the days and weeks ahead, industry sources said this week.</p>
<p>They said leading transportation routes across much of the country were already semi-paralyzed because of threats by Marxist-led rebels who launched a nationwide offensive last week.  </p>
<p>And last week's collapse of a key bridge in northern Magdalena province has already begun to wreak havoc with exports through the Caribbean ports of Barranquilla and Santa Marta.</p>
<p>The bridge spanning the Sevilla River collapsed under the weight of two tractor-trailer trucks filled to overflowing with coal, prompting the government to order strict curbs on the tonnage of trucks operating across the country.</p>
<p>But that order, in turn, has led truckers to stage sproadic protests by blocking key highways, snarling traffic in some areas for miles around.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's every man for himself,&quot; veteran RCN news radio commentator Juan Gossain said Wednesday, referring to the truckers' protests and chaos on roadways across the country.</p>
<p>Guerrillas, who torched two passenger buses on the highway linking Bogota to the eastern city of Villavicencio Tuesday night, pose the biggest immediate threat, however.</p>
<p>&quot;Half the country has been overrun by guerrillas and at this point there are places where transporters can't provide cargo or passenger service because of their threats,&quot; Eugenio Marulanda, president of the national Transporters Confederation, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Police confirmed that rebels had ordered a halt to overland transportation on several major roadways since they launched their offensive last Friday. Nearly 100 soliders, police and guerrillas have been killed in the offensive so far.</p>
<p>The rebel offensive, considered the most violent in recent history, included fighting in the central coffee-growing province of Tolima and a rare rebel foray into the capital where five policemen were killed.  </p>
<p>Gonzalo Rivera, manager of Almacafe, the company responsible for storing and transporting coffee produced by Colombia's National Coffee Growers Federation, said a train carrying 15,000 60-kilo bags of coffee from the northwest city of Medellin to Santa Marta was stopped for two days this week by guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;To be frank with you, there's the risk of a big delay in coffee shipments if this problem continues,&quot; Rivera said, referring to both guerrillas and the deteriorating condition of the country's roads.  </p>
<p>&quot;If this isn't resolved, first you'll see 150,000 bags affected, and then it'll be 250,000, and so on and so on,&quot; Rivera added.</p>
<p>A private exporter said the problem was having a limited impact for now because there simply was not that much coffee to export. For seasonal reasons he said exports would surge in about 10 or 15 days, however, and that exporters were likely to face a steep increase in domestic transport costs when that occurs.</p>
<p>&quot;When people are running late with a shipment they'll pay whatever the transporter asks to move it out,&quot; he said.</p>
