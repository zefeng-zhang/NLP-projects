<p>A government-appointed committee has recommended abolishing special tax benefits granted to foreign investors in Israel, the Treasury said.</p>
<p>The committee, headed by former senior Treasury official Yoram Gabbay, was set up to reexamine the government's investment incentives programme. It presented its interim findings to Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee concluded there is no practical significance to differentiating between various types of investors,&quot; the Treasury said in a statement.</p>
<p>Foreigners investing in high priority development areas pay a tax rate of 10 to 25 percent for seven to 10 years while Israelis pay 25 percent instead of the full corporate tax rate of 36 percent.</p>
<p>The committee's recommendations will be presented to a special ministerial committee and then to parliament.</p>
<p>The government currently provides three types of investment incentives -- grants, tax breaks and loan guarantees.</p>
<p>The committee has also recommended abolishing government loan guarantees for investors. The committee said these guarantees lead to a waste of money. Half of these loans will not be paid back and this figure could reach 70 percent in the next two years, the committee said.</p>
<p>Currently, investors in central parts of the country -- designated  priority &quot;C&quot; -- are not entitled to direct grants, only to a two-year tax exemption or loan guarantees.</p>
<p>The committee has recommended that in C areas, instead of tax exemptions investors will be entitled to pay a reduced corporate tax rate of 12 percent for two years rather than the full rate of 36 percent.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to recommend further changes to the law for capital investment as part of the government's effort to reduce spending.</p>
<p>In July the government approved cutting subsidies for capital investments in top priority development areas to a maximum of 20 percent from 34 percent.</p>
