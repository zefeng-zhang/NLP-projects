<headline>PRESS DIGEST - RUSSIA - SEPT 4.</headline>

<p>IZVESTIA</p>
<p>- The lack of open support from President Boris Yeltsin for security chief Alexander Lebed, who is trying to settle the bloody Chechen crisis, could have two main reasons. Praising Lebed's peace efforts in Chechnya would mean Yeltsin recognises his policies have failed completely in the region. But vagueness over the future status of Chechnya makes the human losses during the 20-month conflict look in vain. It could prompt Yeltsin's opponents to start impeachment procedures against him for failing to safeguard Russia's territorial integrity.</p>
<p>- American military strikes against Saddam Hussein have destroyed Moscow's last hopes of getting back any of Iraq's multi-billion dollar debt to Russia.</p>
<p>- Checks by Russia's Audit Chamber show large-scale corruption and fraud are flourishing in an overwhelming majority of state institutions checked.</p>
<p>SEVODNYA</p>
<p>- Moscow's angry reaction to American strikes against Iraq may be an attempt to present Russia as a country preferring peaceful solutions to military ones. But speaking about Saddam Hussein one has to think twice about which actions can bear fruit and which are likely to fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>- A proposal by a meeting of Russia's regional bosses, chaired by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, that Alexander Lebed's peace plan for Chechnya be discussed and approved by the Federation Council shows that Yeltsin has finally found a way to avoid giving his formal go-ahead for the legally dubious plan.</p>
<p>NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA</p>
<p>- Russia's interests in the Middle East have suffered substantial damage as a result of American air strikes against Iraq.</p>
<p>ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA</p>
<p>- U.S. President Bill Clinton has yielded to temptation to use force in the Gulf to boost his re-election chances at home but using arms in politics has never done anyone any good, says the paper.</p>
<p>MOSKOVSKY KOMSOMOLETS</p>
<p>- It took Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 24 hours and a 2000-km trip to Nalchik to tell the world President Yeltsin gave his blessing to peace agreements on Chechnya signed by security boss Alexander Lebed.</p>
