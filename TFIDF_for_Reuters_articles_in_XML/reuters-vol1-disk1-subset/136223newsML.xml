<headline>Euro veg oils closed virtually unmoved from midday.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Selling levels on the European vegetable oil market ended virtually unchanged from midday, although still mostly firmer against Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The palm oil sector finished unchanged to $5 up supported by news that Pakistan would re-tender for RBD oil on Thursday. On Tuesday it cancelled its tender for 9,000 tonnes of the same.</p>
<p>The only reported trade throughout the palm oils was for Nov, Dec and Jan/Mar all at $517.50.</p>
<p>Soy and rape oil sellers were mostly sidelined during the afternoon watching to see if fresh early gains on the Chicago soybean oil futures would be sustained.</p>
<p>One trade was seen on Nov rape oil for 91 guilders.</p>
<p>Laurics oils closed $2.50 to $7.50 firmer. A switch trade between Sep/Oct and Oct/Nov at a $2.50 to $5 premium was thought to have occurred, but traders were unable to confirm the actual transaction price.</p>
