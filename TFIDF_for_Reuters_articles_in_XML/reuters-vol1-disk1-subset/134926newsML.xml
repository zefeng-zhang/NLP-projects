<headline>Euro-court backs British limits on sex abuse cases.</headline>
<dateline>STRASBOURG, France 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday that four young British women had had enough time under British law to seek damages for childhood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Rejecting a plea by the four women, the Strasbourg-based court upheld British law which gives a person until the age of 24 to start civil proceedings over such abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;The very essence of the applicants' right of access to court was not impaired since they had six years from their 18th birthdays in which to initiate civil proceedings,&quot; the court found.</p>
<p>&quot;Limitation periods serve the legitimate aims of ensuring legal certainty and finality,&quot; the court ruled.</p>
<p>The case had been brought before the rights court by Leslie Stubbings, now 39, and three other women aged 34 to 38 who were identified solely by their initials.</p>
<p>All four alleged they had been sexually abused as children by a parent, an adoptive parent or a school master, but became aware of the abuse only years later with the help of therapy.</p>
<p>They said they had been unable to sue for damages because too many years had passed before they discovered the abuse.</p>
<p>They argued that the statute of limitations on such cases should only begin running after a victim became aware of the abuse.</p>
<p>The court said sexual abuse was &quot;unquestionably an abhorrent type of wrongdoing, with debilitating effects on its victims&quot;.</p>
<p>But it said that even when civil law did not apply, children and other vulnerable individuals were still protected by criminal laws.</p>
