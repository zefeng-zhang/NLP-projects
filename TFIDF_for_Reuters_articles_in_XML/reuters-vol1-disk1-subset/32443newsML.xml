<p>Nearly 100 people, including a member of parliament from the ruling Awami League, were injured on Wednesday in fighting between supporters of rival candidates in the run-up to parliamentary by-elections, police said.</p>
<p>MP Dipankar Talukder and several other Awami League members were riding in a car in Chandanaish, 30 miles (45 km) from the southern port of Chittagong, when they were stopped by armed rivals and severely beaten, police told reporters.</p>
<p>Police resuced the politicians, but their car was set ablaze, they said.</p>
<p>More than 90 other people also were hurt in battles between Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) activists, and six of them were admitted to hospital with bullet wounds, police said.</p>
<p>Chandanaish is a BNP stronghold where Mumtaz Oli is seeking the parliament seat vacated by her husband, former communications minister Oli Ahmed.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is alarming,&quot; one Chittagong journalist told reporters. He said police made several arrests.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 other people were injured in poll-related clashes in Chandanaish and other areas on Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>The Election Commission has said that troops would be deployed during the vote on Thursday in the 15 constituencies being contested, all outside the capital of Dhaka. The elections are being monitored by local and foreign observers.</p>
<p>Bangladesh held general elections on June 12 and the Awami League won 146 of the parliament's 300 elected seats. Its leader, Sheikh Hasina, became prime minister on June 23.</p>
<p>The BNP, led by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, won 116 seats followed by the Jatiya Party of former president Hossain Mohammad Ershad with 32.</p>
<p>Bangladeshi law allows candidates to run in more than one constituency, but they can retain only one. The commission later ordered by-elections in 16 districts vacated by victors who opted to retain other parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>Election officials said 73 candidates from the Awami League, BNP and Jatiya Party were contesting the 15 constituencies. The election in the 16th constituency has been delayed.</p>
<p>The BNP has accused the Awami League of &quot;unleashing a reign of terror ahead of the by-elections.&quot; Awami League leaders have rejected the charge and accused BNP &quot;hoodlums&quot; of trying to &quot;terrorise voters and poll officials.&quot;</p>
