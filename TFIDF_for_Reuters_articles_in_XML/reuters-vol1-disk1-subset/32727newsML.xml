<headline>US FCC telephone rules expected to survive - lawyers.</headline>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission's new rules opening the local telephone market to competition are likely to survive a slew of legal challenges leveled by state regulators and local phone companies, lawyers predicted Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said it is unlikely a federal court would overturn the core of the &quot;interconnection&quot; rules.  They said such a move would happen only if the FCC acted arbitrarily, or grossly overstepped its legal boundaries by making the rules inconsistent with the new telecommunications law.  </p>
<p>But lawyers do not believe the FCC has overstepped the law. &quot;Unless the commission has really overstepped the bounds, no court is going to be eager to overturn this carefully constructed apple cart,&quot; said attorney Jeffrey Olson with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.</p>
<p>Scott Harris, a former top FCC official who is now an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, echoed that view.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission will eventually win in court,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>State regulators already have filed suit to block the new rules, which the FCC issued last month.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the New York Public Service Commission said it asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to annul the rules, which implement the 1996 Telecommunications Act.</p>
<p>The regulator said the FCC rules are an intrusion on the state's authority to set local telecommunications policy.</p>
<p>Last week, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners -- which represents state regulators -- said it would ask the courts to offer a speedy review of the rules.</p>
<p>The regulations are designed to break open local phone monopolies and give long-distance companies, cable television firms and others a crack at offering local phone service.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, GTE Corp and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp said they would ask a federal appeals court in Washington to block the rules.</p>
<p>BellSouth Corp said it would ask a federal appeals court to overturn the rules, charging that the FCC had &quot;gone far beyond the intent of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>U S West Communications Group is exploring legal options, including a legal challenge or having the court set aside certain components of the rules through a &quot;stay.&quot;  </p>
<p>In addition, the United States Telephone Association, a trade group representing the Baby Bells and local phone companies, said it is exploring its legal options and plans to be involved in the appeals process.</p>
<p>But lawyers think the rules will withstand such moves.</p>
<p>&quot;The (FCC) did such a good job here it is going to be sustained on appeal,&quot; said Harris of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.</p>
<p>Lawyers said that while a court could rule against the FCC on smaller aspects of the interconnection rules, the heart of the rules should remain unscathed.  </p>
<p>Still, lawyers hedged their bets and said it was possible that the FCC could lose and that the legal challengers could pull a rabbit out of the hat and have the rules overturned.</p>
<p>&quot;You may get lucky.  You may win the lottery,&quot; said Olson of Paul, Weiss, explaining the tactics behind the challenges.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were a betting man, the odds favor the commission over the petitioners,&quot; said former FCC General Counsel Henry Geller.  &quot;But I wouldn't put a lot of money on it.&quot;</p>
