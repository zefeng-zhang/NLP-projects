<p>French stocks fell sharply and the franc plunged against the mark in early trading on Thursday because of fears of an autumn of industrial unrest.</p>
<p>The picture in the rest of Europe was dull, with bourses barely changed from Wednesday and the dollar idle as most traders were distracted by the mark's movements, particularly against the weak franc.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse was down at one point 0.75 percent to 1988 points, hit by the fragile currency and concerns that French unions were preparing to challenge the conservative government in the autumn over its social and economic policies.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at a context similar to that of November 1995 (when public sector unions struck for three weeks), possibly worse,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are pessimistic on the franc,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>The French currency was in trouble, with the mark forging ahead to a five-month high just of shy of 3.43 francs.</p>
<p>Traders were watching for the mark to hit 3.4305 francs, the top of its old trading range in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), before the fluctuation bands were widened in 1993, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a psychological hurdle at 3.43 but the market is nervous about the French franc,&quot; said a senior dealer at a German bank in London.</p>
<p>Concern about France's ability to knock its budget deficit into shape for membership of the single European currency has resurfaced as budget negotiations for 1997 have started.</p>
<p>Further pressure on the franc was prompted by nerves over French jobless figures out on Friday. High unemployment in many European countries is putting pressure on governments' efforts to curb budget deficits.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about a smooth passage to a single European currency was highlighted overnight by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who questioned the way European nations are trying to meet the tough fiscal targets required for EMU membership.</p>
<p>The dollar was barely changed against the yen and mark from the levels of late Europe on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar hasn't got a life of its own,&quot; said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered, adding that if the mark strengthened further against other European currencies, the dollar would come under pressure.</p>
<p>Other European equity markets were mixed, with London edging ahead slightly as the market consolidated recent gains that saw the FTSE rise to a new closing high of 3918.7 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a position where we have to justify where we are at the moment,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>A successful auction of government bonds, favourable economic news, improved sentiment for U.S. stocks and renewed bid speculation were behind the push.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks slipped in and out of postive territory with markets lacking direction after a neutral overnight close on Wall Street.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 108.32 yen and 1.4763 marks compared with Wednesday's European close of 108.45 yen and 1.4770 marks</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>London,s FTSE 100 index was up 1.2 at 3919.9.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was down 3.65 at 2559.51.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 was down 12.25 at 1990.65.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold opened at $388.35 an ounce, compared to Wednesday's close of $388.55. Silver was at $5.19, down two cents.</p>
