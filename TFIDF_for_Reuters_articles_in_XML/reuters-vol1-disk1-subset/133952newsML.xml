<p>Three major newspaper publishers Tuesday reported sharply higher earnings for the third quarter, boosted by growth in advertising revenue and moderating newsprint costs.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder Inc. said earnings rose fivefold, helped by lower losses from the 15-month-old strike against its Detroit Free Press newspaper; Times Mirror Co. reported a 50 percent jump excluding one-time charges and Washington Post Co. said earnings rose 33 percent.</p>
<p>The results were in line or slightly better than expectations on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder, based in Miami, said earnings rose to $35.4 million, or 37 cents a share, in the quarter, from $6.6 million, or 7 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. The latest period excluded a one-time gain of $90.9 million, or 94 cents a share, on the sale of Knight-Ridder Financial news for $275 million to Global Financial Information Corp. in July.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 2 percent to $653.8 million from $638.0 million.</p>
<p>The company cited lower losses from the 15-month old strike in Detroit and the strongest quarterly growth in advertising revenue this year, despite continued sluggishness in retail advertising, an important source of newspaper revenue.</p>
<p>The strength in newspaper advertising helped offset lower revenues from its business information services, the company said.</p>
<p>In addition to the Detroit Free Press, the company publishes the Miami Herald, Philadelphia Inquirer and 28 other newspapers in the United States.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder Chief Financial Officer Ross Jones said that the fourth quarter would be stronger than the third, &quot;with Detroit making a positive contribution for the first time since the strike began, and with newsprint prices actually declining year over year.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said it would invest heavily in a plan to make its Knight-Ridder Information service available on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet, depressing profits at the unit through 1998 in a bid to bolster results in the long run.</p>
<p>Times Mirror Co., based in Los Angeles, said earnings rose to $55.7 million, or 43 cents a share, from $37.1 million, or 21 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. The year-ago period excludes $435 million in one-time charges and losses from a restructuring programme and discontinued operations.</p>
<p>Revenues grew 2 percent to $885.6 million from $864.8 million.</p>
<p>Times Mirror said results were paced by its newspaper group, where operating profit more than doubled in the quarter as ad revenues grew 4 percent and expenses fell due to the cost-cutting programme and lower newsprint costs.</p>
<p>The company publishes the Los Angeles Times, Newsday and The Baltimore Sun, as well as other newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>The company announced the charges a year ago as Mark Willes, who joined as president and chief executive officer last year, closed New York Newsday, Baltimore's Evening Sun and parts of the Los Angeles Times in a bid to cut costs.</p>
<p>The Washington Post Co. cited revenue gains in newspapers, broadcasting and at Newsweek magazine. It said net income grew to $55.4 million, or $5 a share, from $41.8 million, or $3.79 a share. Revenues grew to $460.3 million from $417.9 million.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder stock fell 75 cents to $36.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts had forecast earnings of 37 cents a share on average, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.</p>
<p>Times Mirror stock lost 37.5 cents to $44.75 and Washington Post stock fell $2.25 to $332, both on the NYSE. Analysts had forecast earnings of 37 cents a share for Times Mirror and $4.66 a share for Washington Post Co.</p>
