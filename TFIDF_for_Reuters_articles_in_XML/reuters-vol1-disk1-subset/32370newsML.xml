<p>European Union member states will have to check this year's U.S. maize imports for gene-modified strains which are not authorised for sale in the bloc, raising the prospect of further bilateral trade friction.</p>
<p>&quot;European member states have to ensure...that (unauthorised maize) is not put on to the market on their territory,&quot; a European Commission spokesman told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A U.S. farm official in Brussels said it was tricky to spot the difference between genetically engineered and normal maize and added that gene-modified products from this year's harvest might end up going for export.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no means of guaranteeing it won't get into export channels,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>U.S. maize exports to the EU were worth $530 million in 1995/96 when world prices were very high. Exports are normally worth $300 million, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know if there will be a trade problem...but it has the potential to be really ugly,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>The Commission spokesman played down suggestions that checks were impractical or risked sparking an EU-U.S. row similar to the one on U.S. hormone-treated beef exports.</p>
<p>&quot;To say it's the start of a trade war is to put the cart before the horse,&quot; he said, adding that most U.S. imports comprised unmodified grains which would face no barriers.</p>
<p>&quot;(EU countries) will have to ensure that they comply with the EU legislation for the residual amount.</p>
<p>News of the checks, which will kick in once imports of this year's U.S. harvest arrive in Europe, came as the EU grapples with a French request to allow the sale of a genetically-modified maize produced by Swiss company Ciba-Geigy on EU markets.</p>
<p>Ciba's &quot;Zea mays L&quot; maize strain, which has U.S. clearance, has modified properties intended to repel the corn borer pest and to increase its tolerance to certain weed killers.</p>
<p>France sought approval for the strain earlier this year, a request supported by the Commission in its proposal COM(96)206. This failed to get qualified majority support in the member state committee responsible for decisions under Directive 90/220/EEC.</p>
<p>Failure here meant the dossier passed to the Environment Council in June, where ministers also failed to reach a conclusion, prompting the Commission to refer the matter to the scientific committees on foodstuffs, pesticides and animal nutrition for their advice.</p>
<p>The Commission said its referral to the committees was justified on the grounds that new scientific evidence had been presented by Austria.</p>
<p>Ministers' questions related to concerns about product labelling and the effects of the maize on human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The three scientific committees are now to review the file and report back to Commission &quot;within several months&quot;, the Commission spokesman said, adding that this would be either at the end of October or November.</p>
<p>The repeated delays highlight the confusion raised by legal services' interpretation of the commitology procedure as it relates to Article 21 of 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.</p>
<p>Officials' interpretations of those rules, namely procedure IIIa, have raised the legal absurdity that rejection or amendment of an approval request is well-nigh impossible by the Council of Ministers once a file has failed to get the necessary majority in committee.</p>
<p>Ministers can reject the Commission proposal only unanimously, an unlikely prospect given that one of them will have sponsored the original request.</p>
<p>Procedure IIIb would allow rejection by a simple majority.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the current rules were due for a review which, given the problems which have occurred, could turn into a proposal for a new directive. The review was not due to conclude before the end of the year, he said.</p>
