<p>The rouble edged down on Wednesday mainly on arbitrage selling but dealers said rouble overnight rates were steady as banks sought funds to square positions after investing in government securities.</p>
<p>They added that trading activity was low, with rates fluctuating just two to three roubles.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is calm and being held strictly by the central bank,&quot; said Neftekhimbank dealer Vladimir Zrazhevsky, referring to the narrow 10-point spread in the central bank's intervention rates.</p>
<p>He added some major banks could be arbitraging their positions between today and tomorrow settlements to obtain rouble funds.</p>
<p>The central bank said it had set 5,437/5,447 as its bid and offer rates against the dollar on Wednesday.</p>
<p>National Reserve Bank dealer Sergei Ignatov said banks could also seek roubles to close gaps which had arisen after they set aside funds for today's Treasury bill and OFZ bond auctions.</p>
<p>The central bank auctioned eight trillion roubles of six-month GKO T-bills and 2.50 trillion roubles of two-year OFZ bonds.</p>
<p>Roubles for today settlement were quoted at 5,437-40 per dollar, the same as in early trading. They were 5,431-34 per dollar late on Tuesday. Tomorrow roubles eased to 5,442-45 per dollar from yesterday's late 5,438-41.</p>
<p>Overnight rouble credits yielded 35-45 percent compared with Tuesday's late 40-55 percent.</p>
