<p>Wall Street has started to get edgy about the U.S. election looming in less than two weeks, with the focus now turning to the possibilty the Democrats will regain control of the Congress.</p>
<p>Until recently the markets have been ignoring the political contest, having concluded months ago that President Bill Clinton was likely to be re-elected. The general thinking was that with the markets buoyant and the economy humming along, there was little reason for concern. But now, with poll after poll showing Clinton in front, a key question is whether the president's coattails will be braod enough to sweep in Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>A Washington-based analyst for a major Wall Street firm predicted that in the final weeks of the campaign a lot of Republicans will be talking up the idea of limiting Clinton by electing Republicans to the Senate and the House.</p>
<p>The analyst, who declined to be identified, pointed to a New York Times-CBS News poll published Wednesday which found a majority of respondents favoring a divided government.,</p>
<p>&quot;I think the message is, 'don't give a blank check to the Democrats',&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>At another large Wall Street firm, one source argued that Clinton was a &quot;weathervane&quot; kind of politician who has recently moved to the political center but could veer back toward the left if Democrats pile up a huge victory in the Congress.</p>
<p>The source noted that in the House, where most experts say the Democrats' chances are better than in the Senate, many key committees could wind up being chaired by urban Democrats with distinct liberal leanings. Years ago, when the Democrats ruled the House of Representatives, the committees were chaired by conservatives from the South.</p>
<p>The Washington analyst said it now looks like the Republicans will retain control of the Senate and perhaps pick up one or two seats.</p>
<p>In the House, the analyst said, &quot;there is no question that a number of incumbent Republican freshmen will lose.&quot; But he said even if the Democrats win the house they will have a slender majority and it will be difficult for them to initiate major new programs.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point the Democrats are unlikley to take control of both houses of Congress,&quot; said Bill Miller, president and chief investment officer of IDS Equity Advisors. He said based on information from the firm's political consultants, there is an &quot;outside chance&quot; that the Democrats will regain the House. The Democrats lost both bodies in a stunning blow two years ago.</p>
<p>Miller said a continuation of the present division with the Republicans controlling the House and Senate and Clinton in the White House would be considered the &quot;best case outcome for the financial markets.&quot; He said the American people appear comfortable with the split and the division counters potential for expansion of the deficit.</p>
<p>Ronald Nordmann, a money manager with Deerfield Management and a specialist in health care, said he does not think there will be a renewed attempt to overhaul the U.S. health care system if the Democrats sweep Congress. &quot;We dont look for any omnibus health care bill regardless of who wins the election,&quot; he said. For one thing, he said, health care costs are getting more in line with the general rate of inflation.</p>
<p>With the Dow industrials down 23 points to 6039 Wednesday afternoon independent analyst Trude Latimer attributed the decline to general nervousness after the recent move to record highs. The election, she said, was just a convenient peg on which to pin the market's latest gyrations. But she said the day after the election, depending on what they think of the results, investors could be finding new reasons to sell.</p>
<p>David Shulman, stategist at Salomon Brothers, said if the Democrats regain control of Congress it could trigger a five percent downward correction, roughly 300 points on the Dow.</p>
