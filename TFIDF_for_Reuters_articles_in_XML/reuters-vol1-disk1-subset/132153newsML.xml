<p>China's economy has entered a period of steady growth and is set to achieve a &quot;soft landing&quot; in 1996 after years of overheated expansion, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>Economic growth rates were expected to be higher than price increases this year for the first time since 1993, Xinhua quoted State Statistical Bureau economist Qiu Xiaohua as saying.</p>
<p>Commodity prices rose a year-on-year 6.6 percent in the January-September period, while the economic growth rate stayed at around 10 percent, the agency said late on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal of 'soft-landing' could be basically achieved within 1996...,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A bumper harvest, growing industrial output and reasonable investment in fixed assets all suggested a rosy economic outlook, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>China's foreign exchange reserves were expected to hit $100 billion by the end of the year, thanks to the rapid inflow of foreign capital, it said.  </p>
<p>Total turnover of retail consumer goods was expected to grow 20 percent year-on-year in the second half, while average incomes were expected to grow by between four and five percent compared with last year, it said.</p>
<p>Consumption was expected to grow by eight percent compared with 1995, it said, but added economic problems such as growing redundancies from loss-making state enterprises remained to be dealt with.</p>
