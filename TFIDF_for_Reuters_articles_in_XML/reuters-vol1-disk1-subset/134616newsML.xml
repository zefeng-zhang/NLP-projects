<p>British automotive engineering and sportscar manufacturing company Lotus Group said on Tuesday it could neither confirm nor deny reports from Asia that it was selling a large stake in the company to Malaysia's Proton.</p>
<p>Public relations manager Alastair Florance told Reuters that he could confirm that Proton had purchased a Lotus car, which it was shipping to Malaysia for studies, and &quot;is in the process of developing a technical collaboration with Lotus&quot;.</p>
<p>However, he said he could neither confirm nor deny a report in the Asian Wall Street Journal that Proton is buying 80 percent of the company, which is actively seeking new investors. </p>
<p>Throughout this autumn Lotus's Italian owner Romano Artioli has said he was close to concluding a deal with a new investor who would help secure the private company's future.</p>
<p>However, despite several false dawns and widespread media and industry speculation, the company has not yet confirmed any specific talks or likely partners and Florance said on Tuesday that situation had not changed.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Artioli) is still looking for a co-investor or a partner, but not a purchaser,&quot; Florance told Reuters by telephone from the company's headquarters in the eastern English county of Norfolk.  </p>
<p>Florance said no further details were available at present, and added that the company was not able to reveal any more about the nature of the likely technical contract with Proton.</p>
<p>Lotus supplies automotive consultancy services ranging from component and engine technology through to whole car design.</p>
<p>This work represents most of its annual turnover and the company has contracts, many of which are strictly confidential, with a large number of the world's car manufacturers.</p>
<p>According to the Asian newspaper report, Proton was to acquire its Lotus stake for 210 million ringgit ($84 million) in cash and would also assume debt of 51 million ringitt.  </p>
<p>Mohamed Zainal, chief executive officer of Proton Cars UK, the wholly-owned British subsidiary of Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd, issued a terse, one-sentence statement to the media.</p>
<p>&quot;Proton has purchased a car from Lotus which is being shipped to Malaysia for evaluation and we can confirm that Proton is currently in the process of developing a technical collaboration with Lotus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman told Reuters that no further information could be made available at present.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co  DWGR.CN said its long-running talks with Lotus had broken down as the two parties had been unable to narrow their differences.</p>
<p>Lotus did not make any comment on that occasion either, but Daewoo Motor has been its most frequently named potential partner in trade press reports, closely followed by a British engineering consortium led by former racing driver Brian Henton.</p>
