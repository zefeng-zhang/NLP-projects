<p>Profit takers entered the New Zealand share market on Tuesday to take the market lower, but brokers said the uptrend would remain intact.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 18.11 points down at 2,349.67 on strong volume.</p>
<p>Among the leaders, Telecom was the main driver, shifting down seven cents to NZ$7.52 after a string of record highs.</p>
<p>Other leaders were mixed.</p>
<p>Telecom's movement was reflective of its performance as an ADR in the United States, where it traded at an equivalent of NZ$7.50 at New York's close.  </p>
<p>Luke Koekoek at J.B. Were said it was simply a matter of the market being sold down after a very strong run.</p>
<p>He expected consolidation from here on, but that it would not take much to move the market up, purely because there were very few sellers.</p>
<p>&quot;The uptrend definitely remains intact, but I think we might see some sideways movement before we see it go up again,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Outside the leading issues, debt collector Baycorp Holdings gained six cents to NZ$3.08 after an upbeat annual meeting in Auckland where it told shareholders that profitability was running ahead of last year. -- James Gray (64 9 302 1253)</p>
