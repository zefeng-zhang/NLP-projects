<p>Ivory Coast's first cellular telephone service went live this week after the U.S. operator signed a long-delayed tariff accord with the government, company officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We finally have a tariff,&quot; said Michael Phillips, Managing Director of Comstar Cellular S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston-based  International Wireless. &quot;We went on line on Monday with approximately 2,000 subscribers.&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>(Corrects from &quot;3,000 subscribers).</p>
<p>A second cellular network, Societe Ivorienne de Mobiles (SIM), indirectly owned by France Telecom, expects to start a full service on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;SIM will start its service on October 25,&quot; said Henri Neuville, the local head of state-owned France Telecom, whose unit France Cable Radio owns 70 percent of SIM. He put SIM's startup subscriber base at around 300.</p>
<p>Three companies were licensed by regulatory authority, Ivory Coast Telecommunications Agency, to provide cellular services under the country's economic reform and liberalisation plan.</p>
<p>But the telephone monopoly CI-TELCOM has until now been unable to conclude an inter-connection accord with the private operators setting out how much they would pay for being connected to the public network.</p>
<p>Comstar, which said it invested $70 million in Ivory Coast, also complained previously that tariffs set out by CI-TELCOM in a draft accord would make the cost of a local cellular phone call excessive.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a good deal from CI-TELCOM, but we had to go to the (regulatory) agency to get the deal,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;We wanted them to lower the rate because the cost of completing a local call in Abidjan would have been too much for most subscribers.&quot;</p>
<p>The new deal forming part of a one-year tariff accord, sets the cost of a local call in Abidjan at 155 CFA francs. If CI-TELCOM had not lowered its interconnection tariff a similar call would cost 30 percent more, Phillips said.</p>
<p>The third cellular operator, Loteny Telecom S.A., whose partners include U.S.-based Telecel International, launched a publicity blitz last month but there was no indication it was ready to start a service this month as it promised.</p>
<p>The Ivory Coast cellular market is projected at a modest 7,000 to 10,000 subscribers, and competition among the three operators is already fierce.</p>
