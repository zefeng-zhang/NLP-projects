<p>Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday.</p>
<p>Brown (14-10) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92.</p>
<p>He struck out eight and did not walk a batter. Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season.</p>
<p>&quot;Bolesy (Florida manager John Boles) told me yesterday, 'You have to go nine tomorrow,'&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the early innings, I was struggling, I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch. I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I wasn't thinking about the seventh, eighth or ninth. I wasn't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has a devastating sinker,&quot; observed Reds manager Ray Knight. &quot;The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league. I remember Nolan Ryan saying in '91 or '92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw (Tom) Seaver and (Jerry) Koosman when they were starting.&quot;</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Delino DeShields's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett (2-3) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies.</p>
<p>Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games.</p>
<p>Darren Dreifort (1-1) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings. Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save.</p>
<p>The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall, and nine of 11 at home.</p>
<p>Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader.</p>
<p>In the first game, Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster (6-2) outdueled Atlanta's Tom Glavine (13-8) for his third straight win, 3-2.</p>
<p>Foster, a .333 hitter, helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single.</p>
<p>The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory.</p>
<p>Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago's four errors.</p>
<p>Mike Mordecai singled, doubled and homered for Atlanta, which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors, 84-50.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win.</p>
<p>Sanders (8-4) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight. He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second, and won for the seventh time in eight decisions.</p>
<p>The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh.</p>
<p>Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth.</p>
<p>Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games.</p>
<p>In New York, Marvin Benard's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4.</p>
<p>Benard, hitting .467 (14-for-30) against the Mets this season, hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch (8-10) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2.</p>
<p>Estes (3-4) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth. Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza, who collected a career-high four RBI, but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save.</p>
<p>The loss was the Mets' eighth straight, their longest slide since September 1993, and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine.</p>
<p>In St Louis, Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4.</p>
<p>Benes (12-8) allowed three runs, walked three and struck out three for the win.</p>
<p>St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season.</p>
<p>Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals, who won for just the third time in 11 games.</p>
<p>Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0.</p>
<p>It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game.</p>
<p>Wall (9-4) struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win.</p>
