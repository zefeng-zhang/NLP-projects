<headline>RTRS-S Gwalia head warns on diesel rebate.</headline>
<dateline>BRISBANE 1996-08-25</dateline>

<p>Sons of Gwalia Ltd managing director Peter Lalor said he applauded the mining industry's retention of Australia's diesel fuel rebate but said the battle with the Federal government is not over.</p>
<p>&quot;We fought very well but the battle is not over,&quot; Lalor told a Gold Coast gold conference at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebate will remain but the Federal Treasury is not happy with the figures,&quot; Lalor said.</p>
<p>The Federal government announced last week in its budget papers that the diesel fuel rebate granted to the mining and other off-road industries would be retained.  </p>
<p>The rebate returns to off-road diesel users such as farmers and miners a long-standing tax on diesel that was introduced as a measure to fund roads.</p>
<p>Answering questions after a conference presentation, Lalor said a mining industry task force of which he is a member would meet the Federal government this week -&quot;it (the rebate) is still a matter for debate.&quot;</p>
<p>Lalor also warned that the gold mining industry was suffering from a lack of skilled workers following the shift by mining companies to underground exploration.  </p>
<p>Sons of Gwalia, which was seeking to mop up control of its Marvel Loch, Leonora and Laverton prospects in Western Australia, saw its strategy as &quot;uncompromising,&quot; Lalor said.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to own the whole belt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A substantial ground position in strategic gold belts is critical in my estimation,&quot; Lalor said.</p>
<p>Consolidation of the major mineralised Archean greenstone belt in the state would combine resources from six mines and three processing areas with an annual production of 500,000 ounces, Lalor said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It would also consolidate the available expertise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sons of Gwalia is currently bidding A$1.80 a share for the 87.6 per cent of Orion Resources NL it does not already own.</p>
<p>Sons of Gwalia also took control of Orion's Yilgarn Star gold prospect partner, Gasgoyne Gold Mines NL, earlier this year.</p>
