<p>Warner-Lambert Co said on Tuesday that it continued to expect its reported earnings per share to grow six to eight percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth of our pharmaceutical business is providing strong momentum in advance of the new product introductions planned for 1997,&quot; said Melvin Goodes, Warner-Lambert chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement with the company's third quarter results.  </p>
<p>The company reported earnings of $2.74 a share in 1995, including one-time gains, which is the number from which the company expects the six-to-eight percent gain for reported 1996 earnings, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert reported third quarter earnings of $0.56 compared with $0.48 a year ago. The 1995 number excludes a one-time gain of $0.31 from the sale of the company's PRO toothbrush business.</p>
<p>It beat the First Call consensus of $0.54 a share.</p>
<p>The company said its third quarter sales of $1.77 billion, compared with $1.78 billion a year ago, were trimmed by three percent due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Its third quarter pharmaceutical sales rose eight percent to $604 million.</p>
<p>Its consumer health care segment's worldwide sales fell five percent to $691 million in the third quarter. The segment's sales reflect the reclassification of Halls cough tablets to the confectionery segment for 1996 and 1995, Warner-Lambert said.</p>
<p>Its confectionery segment's third quarter sales fell three percent to $473 million.</p>
