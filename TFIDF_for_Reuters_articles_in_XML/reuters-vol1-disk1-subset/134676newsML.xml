<headline>FOCUS - Euro bourses drift lower after Wall St fall.</headline>

<p>European bourses weakened on Tuesday after Wall Street paused for breath following its recent heady rise, while the dollar lost ground against the mark.</p>
<p>The London, Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges all began the day a few points adrift, with London slipping from Monday's record close.</p>
<p>London metal prices were stable after the news that Tokyo prosecutors had arrested Sumitomo Corp's former chief copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka on charges he falsified documents in connection with the largest ever financial scandal.</p>
<p>The Tokyo prosecutors' office said Sumitomo had filed formal legal charges against Hamanaka, who it blamed for a massive $2.6 billion loss from unauthorised copper trades.</p>
<p>World oil prices turned lower in early European trade as a combination of factors conspired to take the tone off the recent rally that has seen crude hit post-Gulf War highs.</p>
<p>Europe's equity markets took their early lead from Wall Street and Tokyo, where the the Nikkei also ended 0.8 percent down.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average settled 3.36 points lower at 6,090.87 after lurching along in fits and starts as investors reacted to IBM's third-quarter results.</p>
<p>Wall Street's retreat helped pressure London at the start. But news of a special dividend payout from foods and household products group Reckitt &amp; Coleman and of a merger of Cable &amp; Wireless's British operations with Nynex and Bell Cablemedia provided early bright spots.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index, which hit a new closing best of 4,073.1 on Monday, was nearly 10 point down at 4,063 by 0920 GMT.</p>
<p>German shares similarly opened bourse trade lower, weighed down by the weaker dollar and losses on Wall Street. Traders said they expected to see the market consolidate this week.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index was down nearly 11 points at 2,718, with utility stock RWE weaker despite saying it was confident of reporting higher profits in its 1996/97 business year.</p>
<p>French stocks were marginally weaker, while the bond market looked lacklustre.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little consolidation and profit-taking tied to the dollar and a steady New York,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The dollar drifted further from its recent highs against the mark, falling victim to what traders saw as changing sentiment, profit-taking and demand for marks before the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom next month.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar had been running on sentiment alone for a little too long,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;Interest rate expectations and trade trends turned negative for the dollar a few weeks ago at least.&quot;</p>
<p>French economic data showed a much bigger-than-expected 2.9 percent rise in July/August industrial production and a 0.2 percent rise in French housing starts in the three months to September.</p>
<p>While these figures should ultimately support the franc, there was some question about the seasonal effects of the reporting period.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0920 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5337 marks and 112.60 yen, compared with Monday's London close of 1.5357 marks and 112.72 yen .</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 0920 GMT</p>
<p>London - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 9.8 points at 4,063.3.</p>
<p>Paris - The CAC-40 share index was down 1.35 points at 2,178.87.</p>
<p>Frankfurt - The 30-share DAX index was off 10.97 points at 2,718.16.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold opened at $382.45, up from $381.75 at the London close on Monday. Silver started a cent higher at $4.95.</p>
