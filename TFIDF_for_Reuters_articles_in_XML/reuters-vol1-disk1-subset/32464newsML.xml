<p>Heavy overnight showers fed swollen rivers in northern Bangladesh on Wednesday, worsening floods that have killed at least 22 people in the past week, government officials said.</p>
<p>They said floodwaters inundated new areas in the northern district of Chapainawabganj as the Mahananda river continued to rise, district commissioner A.K.M. Musa said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of Chapainawabganj town is already under water,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Chapainawabganj has remained virtually cut off from rest of the country since Monday after roads were flooded, but authorities on Wednesday brought two additional trains into service to ease traffic.</p>
<p>The situation in neighbouring Rajshahi district remained unchanged over the past 24 hours, local officials said.</p>
<p>The Flood Information Centre in Dhaka said on Wednesday it expected more rains over the next few days and warned that floodwaters might spread to parts of Dhaka, about 170 km to the south.</p>
<p>Health officials in the flooded districts said they were preparing to combat water-borne diseases. More than 200 people have contracted diarrhoea in the two affected districts, officials said.</p>
