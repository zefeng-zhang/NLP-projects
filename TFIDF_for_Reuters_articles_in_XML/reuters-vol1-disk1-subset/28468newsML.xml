<p>The head of British Airways said Tuesday that he expected significant progress will be made by the end of the month toward an agreement to open up the U.S. and British air travel markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect significant progress on an open skies agreement by the end of September,&quot; Chief Executive Robert Ayling said at a news briefing.</p>
<p>The so-called open skies negotiations are key to British Airways' controversial plan to link up with American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp.</p>
<p>Critics of the proposed link-up say British Airways, Britain's leading airline, must give up some of its 38 percent share of slots at London's Heathrow Airport to prevent the two carriers from dominating the lucrative trans-Atlantic market.</p>
<p>The United States called off the latest round of open skies talks with Britain last week, with the issue of prized Heathrow landing slots cited as one major sticking point. Washington wants access for all U.S. carriers to Heathrow, Europe's most popular airport.</p>
<p>Another major hurdle in the talks are U.S. demands for rights for its carriers to fly from Britain to other countries in Europe.</p>
<p>In return for opening up Heathrow, British carriers, including British Airways, want the United States to raise its 25 percent ceiling on foreign ownership of airlines, thereby allowing British airlines access to the giant U.S. market.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. market is saturated. The only way of gaining access is through buying into an existing carrier,&quot; Ayling said.</p>
<p>Ayling said there was still a great deal of &quot;horse trading&quot; to get through before an agreement can be finalised but, despite the obstacles, he remained confident a breakthough would come sooner or later.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe both governments are still anxious to achieve a new bilateral arrangement. I remain confident that with good will and good sense, an agreement can be reached,&quot; he said.</p>
