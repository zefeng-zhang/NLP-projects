<p>The European Union's ambassador to Slovakia warned Bratislava on Tuesday against dragging its feet on democracy, saying decisions on which ex-communist countries could join the EU are fast approaching.</p>
<p>New Slovak Foreign Minister Pavol Hamzik has repeatedly said that Slovakia should be in the first wave of former East Bloc countries to join the EU and NATO defence alliance.</p>
<p>But ambassador Georgious Zavvos told a meeting in the town of Stupava, near Bratislava: &quot;It is only through its own efforts in the field of democracy as in economy, that Slovakia can hope to join the EU.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;There is much work to be done and in this task there can be no delay.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to EU plans to recruit members from central and eastern Europe, he said: &quot;The clock is ticking towards the final opinions, negotiations and decisions, which will begin as soon as late 1997. Slovakia must seize the messages and act.&quot;</p>
<p>His comments were issued by the European Commission's Bratislava office.</p>
<p>Slovakia applied formally for EU membership in June 1995. But the EU and United States have expressed concerns about the development of democracy since populist Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar was returned to power in 1994.</p>
