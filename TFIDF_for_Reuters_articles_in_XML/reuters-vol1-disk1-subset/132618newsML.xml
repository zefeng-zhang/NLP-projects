<text>
<p>Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc Tuesday said its oil and natural gas production increased for the seventh consecutive quarter resulting in strong third quarter financial results.</p>
<p>For the quarter, the company reported net income of $16.5 million, or $0.14 per share, up sharply from 1995's third quarter net income of $7.0 million, or $0.04 per share.</p>
<p>Production in the third quarter of 1996 averaged 105,700 oil equivalent barrels per day. Crude oil production in the quarter averaged 75,900 barrels per day, up 13 percent from the year ago quarter.  </p>
<p>Santa Fe said most of the increase came from its thermal recovery operations in California, up about 6,000 barrels per day over the same period last year.</p>
<p>Natural gas production for the period averaged 178.9 million cubic feet per day, up from 160.4 million per day in the third quarter of 1995, resulting primarily from Gulf of Mexico drilling and the expansion of its natural gas plant at the Sierra Chata Field in Argentina.  </p>
<p>Oil prices recognized by the company in the third quarter averaged $15.72 per barrel net of a $0.62 per barrel expense from the company's oil price hedging program, compared with an average of $14.32 per barrel in the third quarter of 1995 which included a $0.42 per barrel hedging benefit.  The company said it currently has no oil hedged.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Energy's heavy oil production from California continued to realize price strength, averaging $14.75 per barrel in the third quarter of 1996, up from $13.60 per barrel for the 1995 period but down from the second quarter 1996 average of $15.56 per barrel.</p>
<p>Natural gas prices recognized by the company in the 1996 quarter averaged $1.62 per thousand cubic feet after a hedging expense of $0.26 per Mcf, compared with an average unhedged price of $1.35 per Mcf during the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter, the company said, it has hedged an average of 40 million cubic feet per day of its Gulf Coast natural gas production at an average Gulf Coast index price of $1.76 per Mcf, and about 30 million cubic feet per day of its Permian Basin gas at an average Permian index price of $1.55 per thousand cubic feet. Santa Fe said its natural gas hedging contracts expire at the end of 1996.</p>
