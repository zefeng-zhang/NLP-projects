<p>Poland's leftist-dominated parliament on Wednesday decided that former communist leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski should not be prosecuted for his 1981 declaration of martial law to crush the Solidarity union.</p>
<p>Parliament, where two parties rooted in the pre-1989 communist system hold a majority, voted 211 to 146 with 60 abstentions to abandon proceedings against Jaruzelski over his clampdown on the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>&quot;Proceedings are discontinued,&quot; parliament's speaker Jozef Zych said after the vote.</p>
<p>If parliament's decision had gone the other way, Jaruzelski and several other top former communists would have faced trials in a special court for top officials, the State Tribunal.</p>
<p>Jaruzelski, 73, has argued that he and other communist leaders had to declare martial law out of patriotic motives to avert the catastrophe of a Soviet military invasion and end an economic crisis which was crippling Poland at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced -- today more than 15 years ago, after I read certain documents -- that martial law was at that time a lesser evil,&quot; Jaruzelski said in an interview two weeks ago.</p>
<p>He was not immediately available for comment after the vote.</p>
<p>Advocates of Jaruzelski, who was briefly president after the 1989 fall of communism, praise him for his contribution to the peaceful dismantling of the old communist system in 1989 during talks with the opposition.</p>
<p>Critics, mostly with roots in the Solidarity union founded by Lech Walesa in 1980, argued that putting Jaruzelski and others on trial would be an act of historic and moral justice.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of martial law Poland lost a whole decade. A bad economic situation turned into a catastrophy, many people lost their lives, health, freedom and properties... Entrusting the case to the State Tribunal would have symbolically restored justice,&quot; minority right-wing deputies said in a statement.</p>
<p>The martial law decree led to the arrest of thousands of opposition activists, sent tanks on to the streets and sparked a wave of labour unrest, crushed by riot police.</p>
<p>During clashes at the Wujek colliery in southern Poland, police shot dead nine protesting miners.</p>
<p>The Jaruzelski case was opened five years ago when groups which had participated in the overthow of communism were still in power.</p>
<p>They reached no conclusion because subsequent parliaments were dissolved ahead of schedule. In 1993, the current ruling coalition of ex-communists and the Peasant party won general elections and further delayed the debate.</p>
<p>Last year, Walesa failed to win re-election as president and former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski took over.</p>
<p>Jaruzelski still faces trial in the port city of Gdansk over the shooting by security forces in 1970 of dozens of demonstrators during protests sparked by food price rises. He was defence minister at the time.</p>
