<p>The General Motors Corp. plants and suppliers idled by a 20-day GM Canada strike were set to creak back to life after Wednesday's expected ratification of a labour deal with the Canadian Auto Workers union.</p>
<p>About 26,000 union members were expected to approve the deal at meetings in Ontario and Quebec, with some workers returning to work as early as Thursday. All operations at GM's Canadian arm would be up again by Nov. 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Our employees are going to get back to work and we're going to get this Canadian economy rolling,&quot; GM Canada chief negotiator Dean Munger said after the deal was reached Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>CAW President Buzz Hargrove said workers were prepared to get back to work as soon as the pact could be ratified.</p>
<p>&quot;The return to work, if it is ratified, will start immediately,&quot; said Hargrove.</p>
<p>Relieved GM contractors said their operations, crippled by the strike which began Oct. 2, would mirror the gradual restart of GM operations.</p>
<p>The walkout by Canadian workers idled some 20,000 GM workers in the United States and Mexico and paralysed numerous suppliers across North America.</p>
<p>Oshawa, Ontario-based Verspeeten Cartage Ltd., which idled about 360 of its 400 workers during the walkout, said a return to pre-strike delivery levels for its fleet of transport trucks was expected to take up to 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;(GM is) telling us that all the operations won't be back until Nov. 4. The truck plant in Oshawa is starting tomorrow night, the car plants (in Oshawa and Ste-Therese, Quebec) will start up Nov. 4. So we should be back to normal Nov. 4,&quot; said Verspeeten's operations manager Frank Cassano.</p>
<p>On Wednesday in the United States, 803 workers were back on the job at GM's Delphi Automotive Systems plants, and 31 more returned to work at GM's Mansfield Metal plant in Ohio.</p>
<p>But the company has said it told 2,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant not to show up for their shifts on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the return to work at GM's parts plants in Canada would take only a day or two but the ripple effect would last longer.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several assembly plants in the United States that have just gone down and it could be a few days before they are back up again because the pipelines are empty of the kind of parts that come from Canada,&quot; said Dave Healy of Burnham Securities Inc.</p>
<p>He said the cost of the strike in terms of lost production will not be fully known until all plants return to pre-strike levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people are thinking it's about 100,000 (units). My guess is maybe a little bit less, maybe (65,000) or 70,000. But it's a little bit hard to tell right now because you don't know how long the U.S. assembly plants will be down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Healy said GM's fourth-quarter net income will be hit by at least $225 million, a quarter of the $900 million impact of a strike by GM's Dayton, Ohio, workers in March.</p>
<p>The strike at Canada's largest private employer was estimated to have cost the Canadian economy at least C$1 billion ($740 million), but analysts said the brevity of the strike will minimise its impact.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was probably ended just in time, before it did real lasting damage to the economy,&quot; said Doug Porter of Nesbitt Burns in Toronto. &quot;For the quarter as a whole, it will probably take about one quarter of a percentage point off of growth.&quot;</p>
<p>The tentative three-year deal includes a pledge by GM to recognise limits on contracting out work and allows the sale of two Ontario plants.</p>
<p>The union, in turn, made a major concession by accepting that GM's business plan may require deviance from a pattern agreement reached in September from Chrysler Corp.</p>
