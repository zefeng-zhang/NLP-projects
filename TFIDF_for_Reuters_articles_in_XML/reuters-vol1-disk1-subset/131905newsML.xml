<headline>London gold edges sideways, considers downside.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>The precious metals were locked in narrow price ranges on Monday after shifting downwards last week, and the market's attitude remained bearish, dealers said. &quot;Generally the feeling is prices will head lower. The charts aren't particularly positive,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;But people may have become too bearish.&quot;</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $380.00 an ounce, unchanged from Friday afternoon's fixing and barely changed from the London close of $379.90/$380.40.</p>
<p>Activity overnight was lacklustre as Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chung Yeung holiday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Downtrending prices were meeting little resistance from investor and speculative interest, which has been scant and expected to remain that way while U.S. stock market surge.</p>
<p>But some dealers said they expected gold's $380 support level to hold until after the end-of-month expiry of options, which give the right but not the obligation to buy or sell metal at a given price.</p>
<p>&quot;There is options support and physical support at the moment,&quot; a dealer said. But gold's potential to break out higher in the near term was severely limited, analysts said.</p>
<p>One dealer saw a possibility of a slight bounce towards $381.00, but if it managed to get below support around $379.25 prices were pegged to head to the bottom of the current $378-$382 price range. But any action would almost certainly originate in New York, as the London bullion market has been lifeless, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver was two cents weaker at $4.89/$4.91 an ounce.</p>
<p>As the recent leader of the precious metals complex, silver looked on shaky territory and was likely to revisit the September 20 low of $4.81 if prices broke through initial support at $4.85, dealers said.</p>
<p>The platinum group metals were weaker and vulnerable to the downside after drifting lower last week.</p>
<p>Platinum was off $1.00 at $382.50/$383.50 an ounce compared to Friday's London close.</p>
<p>But it was likely to hold above critical support at $380 in the near term, dealers said.</p>
<p>Palladium, which sank to 3-1/2 year lows last week, was down $0.25 at $115.25/$116.25.</p>
