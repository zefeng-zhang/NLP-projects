<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets were very slow, with not enough cattle sold to establish a market, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 100 heifers sold near midday at $69.00 per cwt, but they were light-frame cattle that had gained extra weight by remaining in feedlots a little too long as owners held out for higher prices last week, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those were cattle that had to go,&quot; one Oklahoma feedlot source said.</p>
<p>Top quality cattle were bid $69.00 against asking levels of $71.00 to $72.00.  </p>
<p>Prices were seen underpinned by ongoing light supplies of market-ready cattle in showlists that contained fewer cattle than a week ago, the feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Feedlot cattle prices also were expected to be bolstered by talk that beef prices would moderate amid steady demand from retailers stocking up for early November promotions to go along with holiday turkey and ham advertisements, they said.</p>
<p>Prices could be pressured, however, if current pork price declines are extended and pork becomes more attractive to meat buyers than beef, market sources said.</p>
