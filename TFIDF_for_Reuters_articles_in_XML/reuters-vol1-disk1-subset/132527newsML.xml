<p>Nasdaq stocks closed sharply lower, raked by profit-taking in technology stocks Microsoft, Digital Equipment, and Intel Corp.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 16.5 points to about 1220, or about 1.5 percent. It was its steepest loss since September 5, when the index lost just over 18 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything followed the techs lower,&quot; said Patrick Davis, head of OTC trading at Salomon Brothers. Although Microsoft's earnings were a little better than Street estimates, &quot;the stock was way, way up in anticipation.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft posted earnings of $0.95 a share for its first quarter, beating estimates by a nickel and its year-ago earnings of $0.78 a share. The stock fell 1-1/2 to 132-1/2.</p>
<p>Digital fell 5-3/8 to 29 and touched a new intraday low of 28-3/8. Intel fell 2-1/4 to 105-1/2.</p>
<p>HMO shares also suffered on Tuesday at the hands of earnings concerns, analyts said.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor Index, weighted with HMO companies, fell five points, or over two percent, to 202. and Oxford Health Plans Inc fell 2-7/8 to 41-1/2.</p>
