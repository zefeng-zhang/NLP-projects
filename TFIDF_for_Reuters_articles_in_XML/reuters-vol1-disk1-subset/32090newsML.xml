<p>Residents scrambled to prepare as dangerous Hurricane Fran headed on Wednesday towards the U.S. coast on track for the historic city of Charleston, South Carolina, pounded seven years ago by Hurricane Hugo.</p>
<p>South Carolina Gov. David Beasley issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency, placing the state National Guard on standby and urging residents of barrier islands, beachfront property and low-lying areas to evacuate.</p>
<p>&quot;This storm is incredibly dangerous and must be taken seriously as the life-threatening force that it is,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) Fran was about 485 miles (780 km) southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Centre said. Its winds of 115 mph (185 kmh) made it a dangerous Category 3 hurricane.</p>
<p>Forecasters said weather conditions and warm ocean waters could push it up to a Category 4 hurricane with at least 131 mph (211 kph) winds by the time it hits the U.S. coast, probably on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Hurricane Hugo, ranked as the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history, was a Category 4 storm. It slammed into Charleston on Sept. 21, 1989 with winds clocked at more than 140 mph (225 kmh) and caused more than $7 billion worth of damage. Hugo was also blamed for 27 deaths and destroyed some 17,000 homes in the historic city of Charleston.</p>
<p>Fran's exact position at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) was latitude 27.4 north and longitude 75.0 west. A hurricane watch extended from Sebastian Inlet near Vero Beach, Florida, to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Centre said the watch, indicating that hurricane conditions were expected within 36 hours, was likely to be changed to a warning, indicating arrival within 24 hours, for a portion of the coast on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting landfall maybe late tomorrow night, and probably somewhere along the Georgia or South Carolina coast,&quot; hurricane centre forecaster Michelle Huber said.</p>
<p>The storm was so massive -- hurricane-force winds extended 175 miles (282 km) from the centre and tropical storm-force winds for 290 miles (465 km) -- that forecasters said they might issue a hurricane warning for northern Florida, although Fran's eye was not expected to come near the state.</p>
<p>At Cape Canaveral, about halfway up the Florida coast, NASA managers rolled the shuttle Atlantis back to its massive garage as a precaution against storm conditions, delaying its takeoff. Atlantis, already six weeks late because of rocket problems, had been due to blast off on Sept. 14 on a mission to pick up U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid from the Russian Mir space station and drop off her replacement, John Blaha.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was also in effect for the northwestern Bahamas as Fran moved northwest across the Atlantic toward the United States at 12 mph (20 kph).</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible that Fran could become a Category 4 storm as it moves closer to the coast. If it slows down over the Gulf Stream, it gives Fran more time to intensify,&quot; Huber said.</p>
<p>Tides of three to six feet (one to two metres) above normal were expected along much of the U.S. coastline. Forecasters said swells were already beginning to increase along the southeast U.S. coast.</p>
<p>They also began tracking a second Atlantic weather headache on Wednesday, as the eighth tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season formed about 925 miles (1500 km) east of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean and threatened to become Tropical Storm Hortense later in the day. A previous storm, Gustav, dissipated in the Atlantic.</p>
