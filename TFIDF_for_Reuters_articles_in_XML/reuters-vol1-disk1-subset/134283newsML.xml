<headline>Group says Swiss should return millions to Jews.</headline>

<p>A Jewish group on Tuesday called on Switerland to pay immediate restitution to Jews after the Swiss admitted they had used the unclaimed assets of Holocaust victims to compensate Swiss citizens whose property was nationalized by Poland in 1949.</p>
<p>World Jewish Congress Vice President Kalman Sultanik said the Swiss admission &quot;demands that immediate steps be taken to compensate the World Jewish Restitution Organization to put an end to this ugly chapter.&quot;  </p>
<p>In a statement to Reuters, Sultanik called the admission &quot;a major breakthrough&quot; in the controversy over what happened to hundreds of millions of dollars deposited by Jews in Swiss banks to protect their savings from the Nazis.</p>
<p>He called on the Swiss to examine whether their citizens also received money from the unclaimed assets of Hungarian, Romanian, Yugoslav, Bulgarian and Czechoslovak Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>After its deal with Poland to return the heirless assets of Polish citizens that were deposited in Switzerland, the Swiss government reached similar deals with those East European countries.</p>
<p>Sultanik said that WJC President Edgar Bronfman would report to the Jewish community on Wednesday on negotiations with the Swiss and on recent discoveries related to Nazi gold.</p>
