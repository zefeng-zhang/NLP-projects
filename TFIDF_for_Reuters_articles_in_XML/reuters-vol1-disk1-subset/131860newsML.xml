<p>Forrestania Gold NL said on Monday it is working to update test drill calculations at the Maggie Hays nickel prospect in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The new calculations will take into account results from drilling within the prospect's southern zone announced September 5, which included one intersection of 50 metres, grading 2.02 prcent nickel, with 6.9 metres of sulphides assaying 5.17 percent nickel.</p>
<p>Results from the southern zone helped push Forrestania's share price about 20 percent higher to A$2.02.</p>
<p>Forrestania shares currenlty fetch about A$2.15.  </p>
<p>&quot;The latest drilling results are currently being evaluated and a new resource calculated,&quot; managing director Barry Eldridge told the Australian Nickel Conference in Kalgoorlie.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of this work and a diluted resource figure for Maggie Hays should be available in a few weeks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The most recent resource figure for Maggie Hays shows a total of 11.9 million tonnes of material, grading an average 1.55 grams per tonne of nickel and 0.05 percent cobalt, equivalent to 184,880 tonnes of nickel and 5,523 tonnes of cobalt. More work on the prospect is needed, Eldridge said.  </p>
<p>Eldridge said the company was not far from reaching an objective of establishing a minium resource base of 15 million tonnes of ore.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage, the development aim calls for a medium-sized nickel mine and concentrator, processing around 1.25 million tonnes a year of ore, grading around 1.5 percent nickel over a 12 to 15-year mine life,&quot; Eldridge said.</p>
<p>Current plans call for production of class-two ferro-nickel, which can be direct-fed to stainless steelmaking plants.</p>
<p>Eldridge said the project should see a recovery rate of around 93 percent, producing about 14,000 tonnes of nickel.  </p>
<p>The aim of the project, owned 50-50 by Forrestania and Gencor Ltd of South Africa, is to commence a feasibility study by the middle of the next financial year (June-July 1997/98), Eldridge said.</p>
<p>&quot;In parallel with the study we will be evaluating our financing and marketing options with a view to committing to the project and commencing construction early in calendar 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>Construction is expected take about 18 months, with production starting around mid-1999, Eldridge added.  </p>
<p>Eldridge estimated the total capital cost of the project would be about A$250 million. He said the project would operate at an average cost of about US$1.50 per pound of nickel.</p>
