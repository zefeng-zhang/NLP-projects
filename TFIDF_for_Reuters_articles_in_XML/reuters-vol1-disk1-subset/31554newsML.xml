<p>Authorities in Mali's capital Bamako have banned a march in support of African immigrants in France which human rights groups and other organisations had planned for Wednesday.</p>
<p>The organisers said Bamako District Governor Lieutenant Colonel Karamoko Niare had written to them saying the timing of the march to the French embassy and the prime minister's office was inopportune.</p>
<p>&quot;The question, in view of its extreme sensitivity, is currently the subject of particular attention from the country's highest authorities,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>A two-month protest by 300 Africans in a Paris church focused public attention on the illegal immigration issue. Reforms introduced in 1993 have meant some Africans who had been living in France legally are no longer entitled to stay.</p>
<p>Police cleared the church in a raid on August 23, and since then France has chartered planes to deport more than 100 Africans, most of them from Mali, Senegal and Zaire.</p>
<p>The Malian human rights association and several civic groups met last week to plan a series of protests, including Wednesday's march.</p>
<p>They have called for a visit by French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain later this month to be cancelled.</p>
