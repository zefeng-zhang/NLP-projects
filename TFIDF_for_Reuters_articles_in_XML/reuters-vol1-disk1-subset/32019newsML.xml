<headline>Netanyahu, Arafat have to shake hands twice.</headline>
<dateline>EREZ, Gaza Strip 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>The first time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat shook hands, the gesture was so brief that photographers had to ask them to do it again.</p>
<p>A photographer who witnessed the event said the two leaders agreed to shake hands a second time so that the moment could be recorded.</p>
<p>The handshake, recorded inside a conference room and broadcast only later, lasted four seconds.</p>
<p>Netanyahu rose first, tentatively, as cameras rolled at an Israeli-Palestinian liaison office on the Israel-Gaza border.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader buttoned his suit before extending a hand to Arafat who, having risen in tandem with the prime minister, reached across the negotiating table to grasp it.</p>
<p>Arafat half-smiled while Netanyahu appeared to say something to him. Netanyahu, who took office on June 18 and has resisted meeting Arafat, maintained a serious demeanour.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was the third Israeli prime minister to shake hands with Arafat.</p>
<p>Late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was the first almost exactly three years ago when they sealed a groundbreaking peace deal on the White House lawn in Washington.</p>
<p>Shimon Peres, then foreign minister, also took part in that ceremony on September 13, 1993, and took over as prime minister in November 1995 after Rabin's assassination by an Israeli Jew opposed to peace moves.</p>
