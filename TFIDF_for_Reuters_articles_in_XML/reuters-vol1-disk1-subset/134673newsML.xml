<headline>Standard Chartered slips on downgrade, chart break.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in bank Standard Chartered dropped on Tuesday as analysts at HSBC James Capel shaved earnings forecasts and technical analysts at Robert Fleming moved the stock to a &quot;sell&quot;.</p>
<p>The shares were down 20-1/2p to 661-1/2p by 0950 GMT and 2-1/2 million shares had been traded.</p>
<p>The formation of a &quot;top&quot; pattern on Standard's share-price chart, coupled with an earnings downgrade today, added to weak sentiment surrounding the shares since broker Cazenove warned that the bank's growth was slowing.  </p>
<p>Analysts at HSBC James Capel cut their 1996 earnings expectations for the group to 818 million from 848 million stg previously. For 1997, expectations were shaved to 930 million stg from 975 million stg.</p>
<p>Elsewhere technical analysts said the share-price chart looked bearish and chartists at Robert Fleming rated the stock a &quot;sell&quot; from its quantitative and technical features.</p>
<p>&quot;The chart started off by hitting three month relative lows, said Nick Glydon, technical analyst at Robert Fleming. &quot;Then it fell on high volume and late last week the shares fell below the key 690p level...so there's a nasty looking top pattern.&quot;  </p>
<p>The 690p level was an area of support for the price chart which had been built over the previous two months.</p>
<p>&quot;Our target from this breakout is around the 640p level short-term and longer term the 680-690p level will become difficult resistance in any rally,&quot; Glydon said. &quot;Its definitely topped long-term,&quot; he said. &quot;Both the key relative uptrend line and the key price-uptrend line have now been broken.&quot; he added.</p>
