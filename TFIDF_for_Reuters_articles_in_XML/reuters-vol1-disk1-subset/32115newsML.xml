<headline>Senators struggle over Iraq resolution.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>Key senators struggled on Wednesday to draft a bipartisan resolution supporting the U.S. military action against Iraq, but Republicans and Democrats differed on how much credit to give to President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>As administration officials briefed senators on the two cruise missile strikes against targets in southern Iraq, Republicans also raised questions about future U.S. policy towards the Saddam Hussein government.</p>
<p>Negotiations on a support-the-troops resolution that had been expected to go before the Senate on Wednesday were being led by Republican Leader Trent Lott and Democratic Leader Tom Daschle.</p>
<p>Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts, speaking to reporters following the briefing by Defence and State Department officials, said the problem was &quot;about how much credit one party is willing to give another and exactly how comprehensive people are willing to be.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he hoped Republicans would join in sending a strong message of support for the country, U.S. military personnel and the president's actions.</p>
<p>But Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison said: &quot;I think the consensus is that we need more information before poeople decide what to say in a resolution.&quot;</p>
<p>She called for clarification of U.S. goals before there were any further military steps.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very important that we have clear objectives... and that Congress understands what the ramifications are and what will be the end game,&quot; Hutchison said.</p>
<p>The U.S. military action has won support in Congress but some Republicans have faulted Clinton's earlier policy towards Iraq.</p>
