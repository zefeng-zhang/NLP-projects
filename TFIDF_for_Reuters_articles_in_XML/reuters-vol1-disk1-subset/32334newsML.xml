<title>FRANCE: French planes stay south of 30th parallel in Iraq.</title>

<p>France denied on Wednesday a U.S. Defence Department statement that its combat aircraft had joined U.S. and British planes in patrolling an extended no-fly zone over Iraq up to the 33rd parallel.</p>
<p>After some confusion over whether the French planes flew at all on Wednesday and where, the foreign ministry said they stayed south of the 30th parallel.</p>
<p>&quot;The French planes took part on September 4 to usual missions of defence of Saudi airspace south of the 30th parallel,&quot; ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said.</p>
<p>The 30th parallel embraces Kuwait and a narrow slice of Iraqi territory south of Basrah.</p>
<p>Government officials had said earlier that no French planes had taken off for several days.</p>
<p>They then said the planes took part in patrols of a no-fly exclusion zone over southern Iraq on Wednesday but stayed south of the 32nd parallel -- without going beyond the original no-fly zone set in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, speaking at a news conference with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, had refused to confirm or deny the U.S. Defence Department report.</p>
<p>Deflecting direct questions, he said repeatedly: &quot;France is examining the consequences of the decision taken by the United Nations to change the limits of the southern (exclusion) zone.&quot;</p>
<p>France withheld support from President Bill Clinton's cruise missile raids on Iraq to punish President Saddam Hussein for sending troops into Kurdish areas of northern Iraq.</p>
<p>It also indicated it had not agreed in advance to Clinton's extension of the no-fly zone which the three Western powers have policed since a U.S.-led coalition drove Iraqi invasion forces out of Kuwait in 1991.</p>
