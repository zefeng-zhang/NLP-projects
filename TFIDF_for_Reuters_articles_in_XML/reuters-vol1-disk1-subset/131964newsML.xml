<p>Indonesia's largest cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna surged in late trading on Monday following a weekend announcement that it had cancelled a shareholders meeting, brokers said.</p>
<p>It had risen 1,450 rupiah to 20,350 rupiah on a volume of 1.1 million shares at 0830 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;It had attracted bargain-hunters since morning but a large number of buyers appeared in late trade. It is fuelled by the announcement that it has cancelled its November 2 shareholders meeting,&quot; said one foreign broker.  </p>
<p>Sampoerna said on Saturday it had cancelled the meeting because it would &quot;not pursue a course of action which would necessitate the convening of this meeting&quot;.</p>
<p>Brokers said many investors believed the company was to have put forward proposals to increase its holding in automobile manufacturer Astra International at the meeting.</p>
<p>The market has not reacted well to Sampoerna's announcement last month that a subsidiary had bought a 2.85 percent stake in Astra and talk that it could look to increase its holding.</p>
<p>Brokers said the cancellation of the meeting signalled that Sampoerna was dropping any such plan for now.</p>
