<p>A U.S. peace envoy dropped his plans to leave the Middle East, missing his plane in hopes of helping Israel and the PLO clinch an elusive Hebron peace deal, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But in the West Bank, violence flared again. Witnesses said Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian teenager during stone-throwing protests.</p>
<p>The shooting in a village near Ramallah followed the killing earlier in the day of a Palestinian motorist whose car was rocketed on a road near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. Palestinian and Israeli police were investigating.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac, ruffled by omnipresent Israeli security on a tour of Moslem and Christian holy places in Jerusalem, vowed to lodge a formal protest with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the close protection.</p>
<p>On another diplomatic front, Israel Radio quoted the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, as saying real progress was made in the Israel-PLO peace talks.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was headed for the airport late on Monday when he got a call telling him progress had been made on civilian issues and asking him to postpone his flight, a U.S. official said. It was unclear if Ross would go home on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how he was contacted or who contacted him but he was definitely leaving and delayed his departure because the civilian affairs committee signalled it was making progress,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO have been trying to hammer out a deal on a long-promised Israeli troop pullback from Hebron, the last and most sensitive of seven West Bank cities due to be handed over to Palestinian rule under a 1995 accord.</p>
<p>The progress on civilian subjects contrasted sharply with a flareup in separate talks on security issues. Palestinians walked out during the night, accusing Israel of racially discriminating between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.</p>
<p>Angry PLO negotiators described Israeli delegates' attitudes as that of &quot;occupiers toward the occupied.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately the head of the Israeli delegation treats the Palestinian negotiators as if he is a military leader, and not as a negotiator,&quot; said senior PLO security official Mohammed Dahlan of Dan Shomron, a former Israeli army chief.</p>
<p>Israel accused the Palestinians of trying to put off a deal until after U.S. elections on November 5, thinking that President Bill Clinton would have more leverage then to pressure Israel into making concessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat...apparently determined that based on some sort of foot-dragging, he would attain American pressures on us,&quot; said David Bar-Illan, an aide to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Clinton sent Ross to the region 15 days ago following an outburst of violence that claimed the lives of 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis. On Monday, Ross said he was leaving, ready to return when the time was ripe. But then he got the call.</p>
<p>Clinton had made Middle East peace talks a centrepiece of his foreign policy, and administration officials had hoped for a breakthrough with U.S. elections only two weeks away.</p>
<p>The Hebron pullout has been frozen since March by Islamic suicide bombings and Israeli fears for the safety of 400 Jews living and studying among the city's 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>During his tour of Jerusalem's Old City a red-faced Chirac, teeth clenched and elbows flailing, snapped a sharp command to omnipresent Israeli security men: &quot;Go away&quot;.</p>
<p>They ignored the presidential decree, drawing what Chirac's spokeswoman said would be an official protest from the ruffled French leader to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>All-embracing protection has been in force in Israel for local and visiting foreign leaders since Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Jew almost a year ago.</p>
