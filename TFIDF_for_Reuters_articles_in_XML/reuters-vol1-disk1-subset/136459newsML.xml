<p>Nearly 5,000 workers of Zastava Arms, Yugoslavia's biggest weapons producer, went on strike again on Wednesday after the company's management continued disciplinary measures against workers who protested a month ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reached an agreement with the management, but they failed to confirm in public that 146 workers who protested between August 19 and October 3 and went on a hunger strike would not be punished,&quot; Zastava Arms independent trade union head Zoran Nedeljkovic told Reuters.</p>
<p>The plant's management earlier said it would be difficult to make up for damage resulting from over 100,000 lost hours and called for &quot;disciplinary measures&quot; against the organisers of the protests.</p>
<p>&quot;These workers helped reveal some truths about the company, various malversations, and they do not deserve to be punished,&quot; Nedeljkovic said.</p>
<p>Earlier protests were suspended until October 22 pending talks with the management over workers' demands for unpaid wages and holiday pay, a programme to revive production and the sacking of top company managers.</p>
<p>&quot;We tried to talk to the management today, and all of a sudden all directors are absent. But we'll keep trying this afternoon, evening, overnight, tomorrow morning,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The first wave of protests was staged mainly by production workers, but Nedeljkovic said they were now joined by the rank and file.</p>
<p>A wave of strikes has hit Serbia, plagued by the deteriorating economy and a drop in standards of living, ahead of November federal and local elections in the country.</p>
<p>Nedeljkovic said workers would step up protests on Monday if no agreement was reached in the meantime.</p>
<p>&quot;We will block all access roads to Kragujevac on Monday. The farmers have promised to join us with their tractors, taxi drivers will come, there will be private buses and trucks and we will even drag cannons out from the museum,&quot; Nedeljkovic said.</p>
<p>He added that workers were also ready to resume hunger strike, &quot;but for real this time, and with doctors observing our endurance.&quot; -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
