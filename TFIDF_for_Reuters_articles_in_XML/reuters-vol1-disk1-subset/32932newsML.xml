<p>The European Commission on Wednesday agreed a face-saving compromise to defuse a bitter dispute with Germany over subsidies paid to carmaker Volkswagen AG (VW).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement announced by European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, Volkswagen will keep 91 million marks ($61.29 million) in subsidies from the German state of Saxony despite the Commission's original objections.</p>
<p>In return, the German government pledged to block an equivalent amount of federal aid that had been authorised by the Commission but not yet paid to the car manufacturer, Van Miert told a news conference.</p>
<p>In the words of Van Miert, whose main priority was to put an end to the &quot;blatant illegality&quot; created by the Saxony move in July, the illegal aid will be &quot;neutralised&quot;.</p>
<p>But he warned that if this did not happen, the Commission would seek to have the illegal money repaid by filing an injunction with the European Court.</p>
<p>In any case the whole issue of the Saxony aid paid to VW to set up two plants in eastrn Germany will have to be settled in court, but that process could take at least two years.</p>
<p>The compromise was welcomed by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, who said in a statement: &quot;This decision is an important contribution to bringing back on to a quieter track the discussion over VW's Saxony investments and the protection of needed help for the building of the eastern states.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission in June cleared 540 million marks ($363.7 million) in federal and Saxony aid out of a proposed 780 million marks to support Volkswagen investments at its plants of Mosel and Chemnitz.</p>
<p>The powerful carmaker countered by threatening to end its investment in the region already plagued by high unemployment.</p>
<p>The European Court of First Instance, the EU's lower court, will have to decide on the substance of the case. Saxony has already filed a complaint against the Commission, while the Commission will lodge a separate complaint in coming days.</p>
<p>At the centre of Saxony's defence is a highly contested provision in the EU treaty which allows subsidies to be paid to the former east Germany &quot;to compensate for the economic disadvantages&quot; caused by the division of the country until 1990.</p>
<p>The Commission has refused to consider the Volkswagen subsidies under this provision, citing instead strict guidelines on aid to the car industry designed essentially to avoid adding to overcapacity in the sector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the general feeling in the Commission is that the rules have already been bent excessively to cater for the German problem and that enough subsidies have been channeled eastwards.</p>
<p>The fight over the subsidies paid to Volkswagen in Saxony has been going on since 1994 when the Commission first approved an aid package to the carmaker. It reopened the file in 1995 following evidence that the investment for which the money was agreed had not been completed.</p>
<p>Van Miert said on Wednesday there had been suspicions about another 16 million marks, but the German authorities had confirmed on Tuesday that this amount was a legal loan granted under market conditions. ($1=1.4846 Mark)</p>
