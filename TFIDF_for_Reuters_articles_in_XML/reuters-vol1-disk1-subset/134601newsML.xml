<text>
<p>NWE oil products were steady to lower on Tuesday with gas oil prices lower.</p>
<p>Gas oil eased, dragged down by easier IPE futures amid little sign of German end-user interest and mild autumn weather. Heating oil premiums were steady while those for gas oil were unchanged to slightly firmer. High and low sulphur cracked fuel was steady at $116 and $125 fob NWE respectively for cargoes. Russian straight-run continues to lurk in the background. Naphtha prices were steady but traders said supplies were tight ahead of November loading programmes. Nov swaps were priced at $223/$224 by late morning after an early drop in crude prices, unchanged from Monday. Gasoline prices were steady to lower following a drop in crude and gasoline futures. Premium unleaded barges traded at $236.50 and $237 fob ARA, down from $238 on Monday. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8185</p>
