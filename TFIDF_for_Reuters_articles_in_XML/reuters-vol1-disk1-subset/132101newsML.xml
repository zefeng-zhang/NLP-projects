<headline>Palm Oil-- Asia prices seen down on ample supplies.</headline>

<p>Asian palm oil prices are likely to fall further this week as ample supplies and poor export prospects dampen sentiment, regional traders said.</p>
<p>Indonesian traders said supply was expected to be ample in Jakarta, with at least two shipments of about 10,000 tonnes arriving in the capital this week.</p>
<p>The traders said the shipments include 5,500 tonnes of olein imported by state logistics agency BULOG from Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is weak,&quot; one trader in Indonesia said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think prices have touched bottom yet, but I don't think the bottom is very far away.&quot;</p>
<p>Indonesian palm olein prices have fallen from 1,460 rupiah/kg on October 1 to 1,375-80 rupiah on Friday and 1,400-05 rupiah the previous week.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices started coming off after the government started talking about market operations a few weeks ago,&quot; another Indonesian trader said, referring to intervention selling by BULOG, which enters the market when it feels prices are high.</p>
<p>In Singapore, traders predicted a slight slowdown in exports and ample production may send palm oil tumbling all the way to key support at 1,100 ringgit.  </p>
<p>&quot;We might test 1,100. What we do there remains to be seen,&quot; one Singapore trader said.</p>
<p>Malaysia's benchmark third month January futures closed at 1,121 ringgit a tonne on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders expect Malaysia's palm oil production in October to rise from September as this is the peak production period.</p>
<p>&quot;Production is seen rising and demand remains slow, so we expect to see a build-up in stock level in coming months,&quot; a trader in Kuala Lumpur said.</p>
<p>&quot;With so much oil, players are getting worried over the fundamental outlook and expect prices to slid further in short term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last week, the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) said Malaysia's crude palm oil production in September was 864,730 tonnes, up 6.04 percent from 815,446 tonnes in August. It put palm oil stocks at end-September at 894,030 tonnes, up 11.33 percent from end-August, and September exports at 637,079 tonnes against 687,870 tonnes in August.</p>
<p>But some traders in Singapore said that China could lift the market if it accelerates its purchases.</p>
<p>&quot;That does not look like it will happen since China has enough supplies of vegetable oil,&quot; another dealer said.  </p>
<p>With the Indian harvest underway and the U.S. soybean crop about to be harvested in the coming weeks, palm may come under further pressure, dealers in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting reports every week that the soybean crop is getting a bit better. That's not good news for palm,&quot; another Singapore dealer said.  </p>
