<p>Maria McShane lost an eye but kept the child she was expecting when a car bomb exploded around her in Northern Ireland 20 years ago.</p>
<p>She survived. Seventeen years later that child, &quot;my best friend, Gavin &quot; was shot dead in a random sectarian attack on a taxi depot in Armagh. She fell apart.</p>
<p>Three years later she is one of hundreds of ordinary people who take the pain of living through Northern Ireland's 27-year &quot;Troubles&quot; to a terraced house in Belfast for comfort.</p>
<p>It is the office of a private organisation called WAVE which is now dealing with many more victims of trauma and bereavement since the breakdown of Northern Ireland's two-year experiment with peace started this year.</p>
<p>&quot;People are in despair. They fear for the worst. We are now getting many more calls from people, especially mothers with teenage children who fear violence will all start up again and their kids will be in the middle,&quot; said organiser Sandra Peake.</p>
<p>She oversees an operation dealing with more than 500 people traumatised by conflict and also with their 1,000 children.</p>
<p>It offers counselling and &quot;befriending&quot; services. &quot;People come in thinking there is something abnormal about them because of the way they feel. They learn that they are normal, and it is the experience they have gone through that's not,&quot; said Peake.</p>
<p>Conflict is just around the corner. The house is at the Protestant end of North Belfast but only a few hundred metres (yards) from a Catholic enclave. The intersection has been the scene of many violent confrontations between rival communities.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a flashpoint area. We'd like to move and are looking for somewhere,&quot; says Peake.</p>
<p>WAVE received close to 100,000 pounds ($158,800) in an European Union grant this year, the biggest recipient of the EU's Northern Ireland &quot;peace fund&quot; set up to reinforce normality.</p>
<p>But normality in Northern Ireland means conflict and many fear the province is returning to normal after the breakdown of an IRA guerrilla ceasefire and a summer of sectarian violence.</p>
<p>This month's twin-bomb Irish Republican Army (IRA) attack on Britain's Northern Ireland army base at Lisburn killed one British soldier, injured 20, and triggered trauma lurking in the minds of countless thousands, Peake said.</p>
<p>McShane is one. &quot;There were two bombs. Like the one that hit me. One big one and one small one. When they said a British soldier had been killed, I was just thinking of his wife and three children, of what they were going through,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She is a Catholic, a victim of a bomb planted by pro-British Loyalist guerrillas fighting to avenge IRA attacks and keep Northern Ireland British. But grief knows no religion, she says.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always said a Protestant mother's tears are no different from a Catholic mother's tears.&quot;</p>
<p>Others at WAVE are Protestants, like Kate Lowry, whose husband, daughter and tiny grandson were buried alive in the rubble left by a bungled IRA bomb attack on a Loyalist meeting place in Belfast's Protestant Shankill road in 1993.</p>
<p>They all survived but nine people were killed, including an IRA bomber. It was an atrocity that spurred Britain and Ireland to press ahead with peace efforts which led to the landmark Downing Street Declaration blueprint two months later.</p>
<p>That declaration led to an IRA ceasefire in August 1994, four months after Gavin McShane was killed, and a Loyalist truce in October that year which ushered the longest peace the province had known in a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>It seemed to put a full stop to a period in which, by police records, 3,208 people were killed, 2,258 of them civilians, and more than 30,000 were injured out of a population of 1.5 million.</p>
<p>But it did not stop the phone ringing at WAVE. On the contrary, calls and the client list have been rising steadily throughout the twin ceasefires, which ended when the IRA resumed its war against British rule in February.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceasefires seemed to bring it all back to people. They were asking why had it happened, what did it mean,&quot; said Peake.</p>
<p>McShane visits once a week. Others come and talk when they need to or receive visits from volunteers or full-time staff.</p>
<p>&quot;We have all sorts here, all denominations, fifty-fifty Catholic and Protestant. We get policemen and we get the parents of killed police informers, everyone,&quot; said Peake.</p>
<p>McShane has been coming for a year. She is outwardly jolly and inwardly bleak, but says she is getting better.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to learn to live with the pain, to get on with your life. But part of you is missing. The smile on your jaws isn't true. You put it on like make-up. It's a mask,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after the IRA bombing, she appeared at a peace rally and appealed to the IRA to restore their ceasefire and to Loyalists to stick by theirs and not return to war.</p>
<p>She is mistrustful of the province's politicians and says they have little idea what ordinary people have gone through.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to get all of them and line them up and take this hand to their jaws one by one and slap them and say: Wake Up.&quot;</p>
