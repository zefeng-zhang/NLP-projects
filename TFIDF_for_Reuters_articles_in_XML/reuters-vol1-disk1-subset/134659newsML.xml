<title>UK: UK manufacturing output and orders rise - CBI.</title>
<headline>UK manufacturing output and orders rise - CBI.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Tuesday that total new orders for UK manufacturing firms rose over the last four months at the highest rate since April 1995 and output rose at its highest rate since July 1995.</p>
<p>In its Quarterly Trends survey, The CBI said domestic orders had also picked up at the highest rate since April 1995 with consumer goods producers reporting marked increases.  </p>
<p>&quot;The outlook is for domestic and export orders to grow more strongly over the next four months, although demand expectations have not been fully realised over the past 18 months,&quot; the CBI said.</p>
<p>Output expectations for the next four months remain positive, but slightly below those recorded in July.</p>
<p>The survey showed business optimism increased for the second consecutive survey and to the same extent as in July.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturers' optimism about export prospects for the year ahead has also increased,&quot; the survey said.  </p>
<p>The CBI survey found unit wage costs fell at their sharpest rate since January 1994 and domestic prices fell at the sharpest rate since January 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next four months unit wage costs are expected to fall slightly whereas domestic prices are expected to pick up, reflecting seasonal factors,&quot; the survey said.</p>
<p>Andrew Buxton, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's Economic Affairs Committee, said the manufacturing industry is continuing the modest recovery identifed in the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The improvement is due to rising orders, primarily in the home market, accompanied by a further easing of cost and price pressures. We are reasonably confidence that the recovery will gather momentum.&quot;</p>
