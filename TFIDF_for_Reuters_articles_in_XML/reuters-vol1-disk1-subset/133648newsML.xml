<headline>Stocks pulled down by sell-off in technology sector.</headline>

<text>
<p>Stocks skidded Tuesday amid a sell-off in shares of recently high-flying technology companies as Digital Equipment Corp. reported a bigger-than-expected loss.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed 29.07 points lower, a loss of 0.48 percent, at 6,061.80.</p>
<p>The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index plunged 16.41 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,220.00.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,513 to 909 on active volume of 410 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has run out of steam,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday was the tip-off when IBM had good earnings and the stock rocketed up and then fell apart. Then we had Microsoft. Not helping today was Digital with its big loss,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Digital disappointed Wall Street with a loss of $66 million in its fiscal first quarter. Microsoft Corp.'s earnings of $614 million, while solid, were not as high as expected.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of technology earnings have met expectations and in some cases were better than expected,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research of Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;But that's already in the price. Profit-taking will continue for the next week or so right into the U.S. elections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Digital stock slumped 5-3/8 to 29 on the NYSE, and Microsoft lost 1-1/2 to 132-1/2 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of damage was done in Nasdaq today,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James.</p>
<p>He noted, however, that the market was ripe for a correction after a fast-paced rebound from the correction during the May-July period.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has used up an incredible amount of firepower from the mid-July low,&quot; Bloch said.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq index has jumped 15.8 percent since bottoming in July, and the Dow index is up 13 percent.</p>
<p>Managed care companies were another hard-hit sector, with industry analysts citing investor nervousness about third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Among the big losers, Oxford Health fell 3-1/8 to 41-1/4, United Health shed 1-3/4 to 36-3/4, PacifiCare Health Systems lost 2-15/16 to 68-5/16 and FHP International fell 1/2 to 35-1/4.</p>
<p>HMO-related companies also were hurt, with Amisys Managed plunging 5, or 20 percent, to 30. Medaphis tumbled 6-3/8 to 10-3/8, or 38 percent, after reporting a much wider than expected third quarter loss.</p>
<p>Among technology stocks, International Business Machines Corp. shed 3 to 127, Intel was off 2-1/4 to 105-1/2, Sun Microsystems lost 1-3/16 to 59-1/8, while Motorola was unchanged at 48-1/4.</p>
<p>Compuware surged 5 to 52-1/4 on stronger earnings.</p>
<p>General Motors rose 3/4 to 54-5/8. The Canadian Auto Workers union reached an agreement with General Motors Corp. to end a crippling 19-day strike by 26,000 workers across Canada that also idled 20,000 in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>Salomon Inc. lost 3-1/4 to 45-3/8 after reporting a drop in third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Several pharmaceutical firms reported results that were either in line with or above Wall Street expectations, driven by strong demand for new drugs.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 2-3/4 to 106-7/8, and Eli Lilly gained 1/2 to 69-1/4. Warner-Lambert lost 7/8 at 65-1/4, and American Home Products slipped 1/2 to 65-7/8.</p>
<p>Ontrack Data International, a data recovery company, rose 2-1/2 to 14-1/2 in its first day of trading.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 3.28 points to 706.57. The American Stock Exchange index was off 3.58 to 573.29.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 1.70 to 376.22. The average share was down 19 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,880.260 down 47.162 or 0.68 percent.</p>
