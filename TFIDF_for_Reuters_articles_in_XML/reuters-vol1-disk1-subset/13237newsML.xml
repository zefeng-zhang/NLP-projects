<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the peace process with the Palestinians was moving forward and Israeli television reported that he would meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat soon.</p>
<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman, answering a &quot;distress&quot; call sent in the form of a letter from Arafat, said he would invite the Palestinian leader to his home but set no date.</p>
<p>&quot;As of now, President Weizman, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will meet within two weeks with Yasser Arafat,&quot; Israel's state-run Channel One television reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said he will hold talks with Arafat only when he deems it necessary for Israel's security, but the television report said a meeting would be held prior to his visit to the United States scheduled for September 10.</p>
<p>Asked about the peace process with the Palestinians, Netanyahu told Israel television: &quot;It is starting to move, it is simply moving differently. Not only are we giving, they are also giving. That is the way negotiations should be conducted.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu's senior political adviser Dore Gold told Reuters: &quot;I think we are in the process of coming to a series of understandings between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we can be optimistic that both sides will be in the not to distant future fulfilling their obligations to the agreements they signed in a manner that is mutually satisfactory.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold will meet his Egyptian counterpart, Osama el-Baz, and U.S. Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross in Paris on Monday to discuss a Middle East economic summit due to be held in Egypt in November, Israel radio said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, apparently shaken by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's suggestion that he might cancel the summit, phoned Mubark last week to tell him that peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation would resume soon.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May, is opposed to exchanging occupied Arab land for peace, the bedrock of the peace policy of the Labour government he replaced.</p>
<p>Palestinians are still waiting for Israel to announce a date for a long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron. The PLO regards the partial pullout as a test of Netanyahu's peace intentions.</p>
<p>Weizman, asked why he had agreed to meet Arafat, said: &quot;Firstly because of (his) distress. But that is not the main thing. Arafat, whether we want it or not, is the first Palestinian leader in 100 years of confrontation to have attained a great political achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;He has control over more than two million Palestinians. When a leader like that, who is my neighbour...asks to see me, I think I have to agree.&quot;</p>
