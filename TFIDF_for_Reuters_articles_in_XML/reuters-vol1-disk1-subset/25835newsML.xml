<p>An Iraqi-supported attack on the Kurdish city of Arbil, deep inside a U.N.-declared safe haven, demonstrates a desire by Saddam Hussein to crush internal opposition and challenge the West to act against him, Middle East experts said on Saturday.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said Iraqi troops supported by tanks and heavy artillery fought their way into the city on Saturday and raised the Iraqi flag after heavy fighting.</p>
<p>Iraq said its troops were aiding the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) in their attack on Arbil -- a major base of opposition to Saddam which is controlled by the rival Iranian-backed Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
<p>&quot;He is trying to challenge the West at its own game. If he thinks he can intervene on one side, he can tell the West &quot;who are you protecting'?&quot;, said John Roberts, editor of the Middle East Monitor.</p>
<p>&quot;He is being an opportunist. Whether he pursues it will be dependent totally on the Western reponse,&quot; Roberts told Reuters.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said President Bill Clinton had authorized the repositioning of U.S. firepower in the Gulf region in response to the Iraqi move. He gave no details.</p>
<p>London-based Kurdish expert and writer Hazhir Teimanon said Saddam had deliberately chosen a city within the U.N. declared no-fly zone in a bid to test American resolve.</p>
<p>&quot;He has gone for the heart of the safe haven, the biggest town, because he may feel that President Clinton has been indecisive in his policies.</p>
<p>&quot;He must be tempted to try to inflict humiliation on the West, particularly the Americans in this election year, by showing they would not take action against him,&quot; Teimanon told Britain's Sky News television.</p>
<p>Kurdish experts said the city of Arbil was a target because it was one of the major bases of opposition to Saddam. It lies on the exposed plains rather than the mountainous regions of northern Iraq and is therefore relatively easy to attack.</p>
<p>Ahmad Chalabi, president of the Iraqi National Congress exile group based in London, said Saddam had found encouragement in recent stand-offs with United Nations weapons inspectors and the clinching of an oil-for-food agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;His defiance of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) in the past two months went unpunished. There was no adequate response...so he felt the international community has lost heart and has lost the will to act against him,&quot; said Chalabi.</p>
<p>United Nations arms experts seeking to implement the scrapping of Iraqi weapons have twice been barred from entering sensitive sites in the past three months.</p>
<p>Chalabi also cited U.N Security Council resolution 986, yet to be implemented, under which Iraq will be allowed to sell $2 billion of oil over six months to buy food and medicine for its population.</p>
<p>&quot;He has resolution 986...He feels that this is immune to any kind of activity he does now so he will try to get this money to bolster his forces,&quot; Chalabi said.</p>
<p>Roberts said he also believed that resolution 986 had given encouragement to Saddam to take advantage of a divided Kurdish opposition and send a bold signal to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&quot;The front lines have remained more or less unchanged since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;He now has a real chance to change those front lines to his advantage and that would send a very powerful message to the opposition as a whole that says &quot;I&quot;m in charge not you. I&quot;m expanding my influence not diminishing it,&quot; said Roberts.</p>
