<p>Georgia Department of Labor's Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators moved cautiously upward in July, signaling moderate growth in the state's post-Olympic economy, state Labor Commissioner David Poythress said Wednesday.</p>
<p>July's leading indicators, designed to forecast economic activity three to six months ahead, rose 0.73 to 143.15 on a 1988 base of 100.</p>
<p>The Composite Index of Coincident Economic Indicators, which measure current economic activity, surged 4.62 points on Olympic spending, rising to 148.01 on a 1987 base of 100.</p>
<p>Economists have long predicted Georgia's robust economy would slow after the games. They expect to see the first effect of that moderation in the August figures, although the economy is expected to remain strong for the rest of 1996.</p>
<p>July's upturn in the index of leading indicators was fueled by sharp increases in applications for new corporate charters and residential building permits.</p>
<p>The state received 2,964 corporate charter applications in July, up from 2,665 in June. Residential building permit issuance rose to 6,458 in July from 6,206 in June.</p>
<p>New motor vehicle sales and the average length of the manufacturing work week, two other leading indicators, saw declines. The work week decreased to 42.4 hours in July from 42.5 hours in June, while new vehicle sales dipped to 39,164 in July from 42,048 in June. Initial unemployment claims rose to 29,932 in July from 29,377 in June.</p>
<p>The number of residential building permits issued in Georgia during the first seven months totaled 48,800, up from 42,048 during the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Growth in the number of corporate charters issued this year has been sizeable also for 1996. The state issued 19,948 in the first seven months of 1996, for a monthly average of 2,850. That was up from 19,315 and 2,759 for last year.</p>
