<headline>INTERVIEW - C&amp;W chief rules nothing out.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cable &amp; Wireless Plc chief executive Richard Brown told Reuters on Tuesday he did not rule out further international alliances in the wake of the plan to merge the company's UK unit with three cable operators.</p>
<p>&quot;We never rule anything out,&quot; he said after the announcement that C&amp;W had reached agreement to merge its UK unit Mercury with NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron Holdings. &quot;This is a solid foundation.&quot; The merger will create a new company called Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, to be listed separately in London and New York, in which C&amp;W will have a controlling 52.6 percent stake.  </p>
<p>The plan comes five months after C&amp;W named Brown as its chief executive following last year's boardroom bust-up in which the top two executives, chairman Lord Young and chief executive James Ross, left the company following a dispute over strategy.</p>
<p>Brown was previously in charge of accounting services group H&amp;R Block Inc and prior to that was vice-chairman of U.S. telecoms group Ameritech Corp.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also follows the abandonment earlier this year of C&amp;W's merger talks with British Telecom, and comes after months of bid speculation around C&amp;W centred on its valuable controlling stake in Hong Kong Telecoms.  </p>
<p>At a time when other telecommunication groups were trying to expand their international operations, Brown said C&amp;W was already &quot;the most global telecom company on earth&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the speedy agreement of today's merger demonstrated what C&amp;W could achieve. &quot;Any of the banks involved will tell you this was the impossible achieved in record time,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a common vision of what could be done and we have done it with speed and nimbleness,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you put your hearts and minds to something, you can finish it in five weeks, whereas we were speaking to BT for five months.&quot;  </p>
<p>C&amp;W's deputy group chief executive Rod Olsen said the merger would result in a wide range of benefits to C&amp;W and to its new cable partners.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite clearly something of this scale offers significant opportunities for cost savings, a significant strengthening of purchasing power and significant capital expenditure efficiencies,&quot; Olsen said.</p>
<p>It would also offer economies of scale on programming costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Cable companies are debt-laden and with this deal we have opportunities to reduce the cost of debt and to open up new opportunities to enhance revenue,&quot; Olsen said.  </p>
<p>Brown said the merged company would give C&amp;W's Mercury unit access to six million homes in addition to its existing mainly business customers, giving access to 18 million consumers in total. &quot;It is very exciting for consumers and good for our shareholders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yet Brown said he was constrained in the detail he could give on the financial aspects of the merger because of the planned public listing of C&amp;W Communications.</p>
<p>As with any initial public offering, stock exchange authorities impose rules on what can be said about a company coming to market and when.</p>
