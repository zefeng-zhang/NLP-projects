<p>Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais said on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin would like to be left in peace to recover from the exertions of the summer and he, for one, would not dare demand a meeting.</p>
<p>Comments by Chubais at a Moscow news conference were evidently designed to counter rumours stirred by his prolonged absences from public view since he won re-election in July.</p>
<p>More than that, however, they seemed to suggest it could be some time yet before he resumed regular public appearances. He hinted that, emotionally, Yeltsin was in need of a period of seclusion but made no comment at all about his physical state.</p>
<p>Chubais, appointed Yeltsin's chief aide in July, said Yeltsin had &quot;stunned&quot; him when he asked him to meet journalists, at least for a short while, to dispel persistent rumours of a serious illness.</p>
<p>&quot;You have just come back from holiday. Did we pester you when you were there?&quot; he quoted Yeltsin as asking him.</p>
<p>&quot;He made me understand a person may have personal reasons, even if this person happens to be the president of Russia&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;So I think we should proceed from this when we think about any meetings with the president...(Now) I cannot even dare to insist -- 'Meet me, Boris Nikolayevich'.&quot;</p>
<p>Soviet leaders had a tradition of receiving visiting dignitaries during their summer holidays and the practice was carried over into post-Soviet times. Yeltsin was in the past regularly visited by ministers and aides at his summer home.</p>
<p>Rumours about the health of the president, who retreated to a country residence 10 days ago, have abounded this summer, occasionally taking a hold in Western financial markets.</p>
<p>Speculation has included a stroke, new heart problems, liver troubles or a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has acknowledged suffering a breakdown in 1987 after he was publicly humbled by rival Mikhail Gorbachev and expelled from the then-ruling communist power elite.</p>
<p>Former privatisation supremo Chubais, a hate figure to communist opponents, said his team was ready to fill in for the president during his absence.</p>
<p>&quot;I must tell you we are coping ourselves, trying to cope,&quot; he said. &quot;We tend to forget that the president is also an ordinary person who has the right to have a holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>There has been no official word on when the president will return from holiday.</p>
<p>Only one meeting, with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, has been announced since August 26. Yeltsin is preparing to see German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a personal friend, on Saturday.</p>
<p>Chubais conceded rumours and speculation about Yeltsin's health were partly a result of the secrecy surrounding the 65-year-old president for the last few months.</p>
<p>He promised changes in information policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, there is a huge amount of speculation, justified to a certain extent,&quot; Chubais said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to make serious changes in the information policy of the administration. We must understand that the less official information there is, the more speculation and rumours,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ginger-haired Chubais, 41, masterminded Russia's huge privatisation programme, a cornerstone of market reforms launched in 1992. He pushed the plan through despite a change of prime minister and fierce opposition from conservatives.</p>
<p>Yeltsin sacked him in January, but soon brought him to his election campaign team where Chubais quickly started to play a leading role, clashing with hawks like Yeltsin's bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov, whom the president eventually sacked.</p>
<p>When Yeltsin won he appointed Chubais chief of his staff and first aide -- effectively the closest man to the president in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Asked whether Yeltsin would return from the holiday as energetic as he was during the election campaign, he answered: &quot;I think you can expect this. I do not exclude that the coming days will bring new important information.&quot;</p>
