<p>Lightning struck a boat carrying West African traders off Sierra Leone, killing at least 25 out of more than 70 passengers, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 40 passengers were still missing, feared dead.</p>
<p>Police said 25 bodies had been dragged from the wreck of the boat, which split in two when it was hit by a bolt of lightning 10 miles off the Sierra Leone town of Kambia on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;Survivors said there were more than 70 passengers on board the boat but only 35 -- the 25 dead and 10 rescued -- have been brought ashore,&quot; said a police officer in Kambia.</p>
<p>Staff at the Baptist Hospital in nearby Kasire said 20 bodies had been taken to the mortuary there.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the bodies have had to be buried as they were already decomposing. Relatives of the passengers have been storming the hospital for information,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Search parties of police and local fishermen continued to look for survivors or bodies 15 hours after the accident.</p>
<p>The boat was travelling from the Guinean capital Conakry to Freetown and passengers were mostly Guinean or Sierra Leonean.</p>
<p>Boat accidents are common in Sierra Leone, where dilapidated roads are made doubly unsafe by armed guerrillas, and traders resort increasingly to the use of river transport.</p>
<p>Thirty people drowned in an accident last month and nearly 300 have perished in boat disasters in the last four months.</p>
