<p>Canada's inflation remained tame in September as the unadjusted consumer price index rose 0.1 percent on the month and 1.5 percent on the year, Statistics Canada said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The core CPI, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.1 percent on the month and 1.2 percent on the year, inching close to the bottom of the Bank of Canada's 1.0 to 3.0 percent inflation target range.</p>
<p>The numbers heightened speculation that another interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada was imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;The highlight of the data I'd say was the dip in the year-on-year core rate to 1.2 percent. That's the lowest it has been since January 1995,&quot; said Harvinder Kalirai, Canadian analyst with I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very close to testing the floor of the Bank of Canada's 1.0 to 3.0 percent target. Given the fact of the sluggish domestic economy, wide output gap and still subdued price pressures, it gives further incentive for the Bank of Canada to keep easing rates,&quot; Halirai said.</p>
<p>The central bank last cut its key bank rate to 3.75 percent on Oct. 16, bringing interest rates in Canada to their lowest levels in almost 40 years.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds and Treasury bills rose following the CPI report, while the Canadian dollar eased amid expectations of a rate cut.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of economists had forecast the seasonally adjusted CPI to rise 0.3 percent on the month and the unadjusted CPI to rise 0.1 percent on the month. The survey also forecast a 1.4 percent rise in the all-items and a 1.3 percent rise in the core CPI.</p>
