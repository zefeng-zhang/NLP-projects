<p>Shares in Finnish food group Raision Tehtaat Oy surged on Tuesday after it announced the strategic purchase of a Swedish company, partly as an outlet for its cholesterol-cutting margarine.</p>
<p>Raisio's stock advanced 17.50 markka or over six percent to 305.00 around the Helsinki midday after it said it had bought a 77.5 percent majority stake in Swedish margarine maker Carlshamn Mejeri Ab and had an option to buy the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;This acquisition is part of our Group strategy, and will give Raisio a prominent standing in the Baltic region margarine market,&quot; Raisio chief executive Matti Salminen said in a statement.</p>
<p>The deal, which Raisio said needed approval from the Swedish office for free competition, involved a margarine operation with about one-third of the Swedish market and sales at 560 million markka almost level with Raisio's own margarine division.</p>
<p>&quot;The total price will be around FIM 200 million,&quot; Raisio said. Vice president Kari Jokinen said by telephone that figure included the cost of exercising the option.</p>
<p>Raisio said Carlshamn was in extremely good shape with skilled and well-motivated staff, and would immediately offer a manufacturing and marketing channel for its cholesterol-cutting Benecol margarine once raw material supply is adequate.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one step on the way to growing Benecol worldwide,&quot; said Jokinen, adding that it was a significant step for the patented new product in the Scandinavian market.</p>
<p>&quot;Sweden will obviously be an eager market for Benecol margarines, and Raisio expects to have products to offer it in the course of 1997,&quot; Raisio said.</p>
<p>Benecol is so far on sale only in Finland, its availability restricted by scarce supplies of the key raw ingredient, stanol esters, made from plant sterol most common in pine trees.</p>
<p>The plant sterol has hitherto been washed away as a by-product of the pulp-making process and Raisio is working to ensure more long-term supply.</p>
<p>Raisio, which will brief investors on Thursday on steps it is taking to distribute the margarine internationally, has seen its stock price explode this year amid enthusiasm for the new product's prospects.</p>
<p>The stock has surged by 450 percent to an early September peak of 339.00 markka, but had since been retreating.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this was a really good acquisition because Raisio will get market share in Sweden, more capacity for Benecol and a boost for their export outlets,&quot; said Ritva Ojala, analyst at Aktia Bank. Analysts said the purchase price also looked cheap.</p>
<p>Carlshman Mejeri also produces ice-cream and almond paste and is Sweden's second biggest ice-cream producer with 20 percent of the market, Raisio said.</p>
<p>Raisio's margarine unit in 1995 had sales of 594 million markka -- which it said would rise next year to one and a half billion markka.</p>
<p>Raisio bought the company from a financial group involving CVC Capital Partners, the Atle Konsumentprodukter AB investment company and a number of its senior staff.</p>
<p>It was sold to its present owners three years ago when it was made clear it would be resold, Raisio said.</p>
