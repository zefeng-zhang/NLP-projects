<p>Finnish fiscal policy will remain austere and the drive towards joining EMU will continue, according to a top aide to Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery on Monday evening and received on Tuesday, state secretary Rauno Saari, head of the prime minister's office, said state expenditure had to be kept within tight limits, perhaps even cut further.</p>
<p>Speaking at the University of Vaasa one day after municipal and European Parliament elections had shown strong popular support for EMU-sceptics, Saari said Finnish membership of EMU was logical after Finland had joined the European Union in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Membership of Europe's economic and monetary union is a natural continuation of Finland's EU-membership,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;By 1998, Finland will fulfil the criteria required to enter EMU. Membership of the monetary union would immediately give Finland an anchor in the effort to achieve a stable monetary environment,&quot; Saari said.</p>
<p>The Finnish risk premium on long-term interest rates would be &quot;permanently removed&quot; after a couple of years on condition that Finnish economic policy was credible and inflation expectations low, he said, adding it would be more difficult to earn credibility outside EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;Lowering the public indebtedness burdening Finland, like many other EU-countries, will require restrictions on public spending, and perhaps even further cuts,&quot; Saari said.</p>
<p>But public spending cuts should not affect areas like education, research and development or information technology infrastructure development.</p>
<p>And despite the pruning of social security and public sector services, citizens' basic security should be kept &quot;so good that the stability of society is not shaken,&quot; Saari said.</p>
<p>He said income taxes were too high and should be cut since they damage employment prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;In developing the taxation structure, the tax burden should be spread out more evenly by moving more towards taxation of other production components and of the use of income,&quot; Saari said. &quot;It would be important to make all forms of income as broadly as possible subject to taxation.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that in conditions of unrestricted capital flows, capital gains taxation could not be clearly higher in Finland than in other countries.</p>
