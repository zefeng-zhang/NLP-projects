<p>There is concern in the U.S. Congress that U.S. allies have not shown the same level of support for this week's actions against Iraq as they did for the 1991 Gulf War, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The contrast between Desert Storm and the current level of (allied) support is a concern,&quot; the Georgia Republican told reporters. He said Congress would fully support U.S. troops in the Middle East. The Senate is drafting a resolution of support.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are supporting the American troops in the Middle East. We think it is important to be united in moments of international tension,&quot; Gingrich said.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona said the resolution to be brought before the Senate would address the need to build an international coalition to stand behind actions against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rather than chiding U.S. allies for their reluctance to support the effort.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton carried out missile strikes against Iraq without support from some U.S. allies and despite Arab League opposition. This contrasted with the broad coalition that backed U.S.-led action in the Gulf in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The Senate resolution will mention the president but Democrats are expected to press for a more strongly-worded statement of backing for Clinton's decisions in the Gulf, McCain said. Republicans intend to press the president to articulate the objectives of the action more clearly, he told reporters.</p>
