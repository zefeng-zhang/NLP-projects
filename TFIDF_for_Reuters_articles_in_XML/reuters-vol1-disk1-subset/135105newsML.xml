<p>Nobel peace prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta on Tuesday dismissed as &quot;silly&quot; a Philippine ban on him entering the country during the upcoming APEC summit, saying it would only draw media attention to East Timor.</p>
<p>&quot;I am always amazed that an individual like me, without an army and navy behind me, can be considered a potential disturbance,&quot; Ramos-Horta told Reuters from his Sydney home.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no intention of going to the Philippines to create disturbance. My idea was to engage in public forums to discuss a peace process (for East Timor), with possible Philippines mediation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Philippines' top security official confirmed on Monday that Ramos-Horta had been banned from entering the country, saying his presence would be an &quot;embarrassment&quot;.</p>
<p>Presidential national security adviser Jose Almonte said Ramos-Horta was in the category of foreigners who &quot;may cause disturbance&quot; during the November 25 summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in nearby Subic freeport.</p>
<p>&quot;Our assessment is it (Ramos-Horta's presence) will cause embarrassment to the nation,&quot; Almonte told reporters.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for the East Timor resistance movement, and East Timor Catholic bishop Carlos Belo were named joint winners of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize 10 days ago.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975, just after Portugal pulled out, and annexed the territory the following year. The United Nations does not recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.</p>
<p>President Fidel Ramos said last weekend he had ordered the immigration bureau to bar the entry of anyone who might disrupt the summit meeting, but Ramos did not specifically mention the East Timorese resistance leader.</p>
<p>A parliamentary spokesman has said Ramos-Horta's ban was out of respect to Indonesian President Suharto who is expected to attend the APEC summit.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta said he had planned to attend a non-governmental organisations conference in Manila from November 21-24 and not visit the APEC venue at Subic Bay. &quot;They are silly raising all this media attention on me, causing all this fuss,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The media would not have cared about me and my conference. We would have been lucky to get one journalist.&quot;</p>
<p>Manila barred Ramos-Horta and other East Timorese dissidents from entering the country in 1994 during an international human rights conference on East Timor.</p>
<p>&quot;Two years ago...Indonesia bullied the Philippines into trying to cancel the conference. As a result hundreds of media articles appeared on East Timor,&quot; Ramos-Horta said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a major public relations fiasco.&quot;</p>
