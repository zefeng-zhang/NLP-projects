<p>The south Korean captain of a fishing boat and 11 other seamen have been killed in an apparent mutiny in the South Pacific by Chinese crewmembers, Korean police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>A Korean maritime police officer said by telephone from the port of Pusan that the mutineers, ethnic Koreans from China, apparently revolted over harsh working conditions.</p>
<p>He said all bodies were dumped overboard and the Honduras-registered vessel was found by a Japanese martime patrol craft drifing without fuel south of Japan early on Sunday morning. There had been no contact with the vessel since August 3.</p>
<p>Citing Japanese maritime police, he said six Chinese-Korean sailors, six Indonesians and one Korean were on board the vessel when it was found.</p>
<p>Captain Choi Ki-taek, six other Koreans, four Indonesians and one Chinese-Korean perished in the mutiny that occured as the tuna fishing vessel was sailing towards the South Pacific island of Samoa.</p>
<p>He said there was no official explanation of how the killing occurred. Japanese maritime police were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the 254 gross tons Pescarmar No. 15 was operated by the Korean fishing company, Daehyun, for Omani owners.</p>
<p>Korean employers around Asia have earned a reputation for tough, and at times brutal, management of their workers, leading to industrial disputes everywhere from Vietnam to China.</p>
<p>South Korea's deep sea fishing fleet has been forced to employ increasing numbers of overseas crew as Koreans spurn low wage jobs as deck hands.</p>
<p>The maritime police officer said the mutiny apparently broke out sometime after August 3 when the captain radioed to say he was heading for Samoa to replace rebellious crewmembers.</p>
<p>&quot;The captain of the boat reported fishing was not possible as ethnic Koreans refused to work and so he was sailing towards the Samoa base,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mutiny seems to have followed immediately because all communication was cut off after that.&quot;</p>
<p>After the mutiny the boat headed for China, he added.</p>
<p>An official of South Korea's Maritime Affairs Ministry said Japanese maritime police would investigate the incident because the boat was found in Japanese territorial waters. Seoul initially demanded the boat be sent to South Korea.</p>
<p>The officer said a Japanese vessel on Saturday picked up a distress signal from the stricken boat.</p>
<p>An official with South Korea's Jeyang Co Ltd, which recruited the crew for the ill-fated vessel, said the ship sailed from Pusan on June 7.</p>
