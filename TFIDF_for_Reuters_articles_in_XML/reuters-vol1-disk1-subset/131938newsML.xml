<p>Indonesian palm olein prices inched lower in late trading on Monday as buyers stayed sidelined amid increasing selling pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>They said olein was generally at 1,365-70 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, down from 1,370-75 rupiah at the opening. They said offers were also heard at 1,355-60 rupiah/kg.</p>
<p>&quot;There was very little buying interest,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Buyers are not keen because they feel prices will decline further...how much further is everybody's question.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said one player was unloading a shipment of 4,800 tonnes of olein in Jakarta.  </p>
<p>They said another shipment of 5,500 tonnes of olein, apparently imported by state logistics agency from Malaysia, was expected to enter the Jakarta market next week.</p>
<p>Traders said olein prices have fallen by about 100 rupiah/kg in recent weeks because the market was oversold.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was oversold and prices had to come down,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Prices will dip a bit more before they recover. Prices should be doing better by next month.&quot;</p>
