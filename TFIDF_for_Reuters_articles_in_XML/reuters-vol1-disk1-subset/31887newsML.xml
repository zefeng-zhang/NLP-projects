<p>Australia on Wednesday launched its biggest overseas trade promotion aimed at India at the start of a 15-month campaign to upgrade ties with South Asia.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the A$6.0 million (US$4.7 million) &quot;Australia India New Horizons&quot; programme was aimed at encouraging trade by correcting outdated Indian perceptions of Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;It will also herald the beginning of a renewed emphasis in the development of Australia's relations with the entire South Asia region, culminating in next year's Year of South Asia initiative,&quot; Downer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout 1997, the government will devote considerable efforts to upgrading ties with all countries in South Asia...&quot;</p>
<p>Downer said economic reforms in India since 1991 had resulted in seven percent economic growth in 1995/96, opening up a huge market for Australian companies.</p>
<p>Two-way trade between Australia and India was worth A$1.7 billion in 1995/96 and should double by the year 2000, he said, while Australian investment in India was around A$500 million at the end of 1995 from a &quot;negligible&quot; amount in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>&quot;On current trends India will be amongst Australia's top 10 trading partners within the next three years,&quot; Downer said.</p>
<p>Australian exports to India were primarily coal, wool, metals, machinery, transport equipment and other manufactured goods.</p>
<p>But Downer said opportunities existed for Australian trade in financial and educational services, environmental technology, computer software, telecommunications and medical technology.</p>
<p>The trade promotion campaign between October 22 and early December will be staged in six Indian cities and will involve farmers, chefs and musicians as well as business leaders.</p>
