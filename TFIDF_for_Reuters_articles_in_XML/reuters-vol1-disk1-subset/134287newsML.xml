<headline>German court sentences ex-DG Bank trader to jail.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>A German court Tuesday sentenced the former head bond dealer of DG Bank to 5-1/2 years in jail for breach of trust, ending a mammoth trial which arose from a billion-mark ($650 million) trading scandal.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt district court found Friedrich Steil, 55, guilty of breach of trust for misuse of company funds relating to bond trades he conducted on his own account and at the bank's expense between 1987 and 1990.</p>
<p>Three other former traders at the bank, the central clearing bank for Germany's co-operative banks, were given suspended jail sentences of between 18 and 24 months.</p>
<p>The 3-1/2 year trial, one of Germany's longest-running financial cases, was linked to bond deals in the 1980s which plunged DG Bank into crisis, caused top executives to resign and led to a deep restructuring.</p>
<p>DG Bank lost 800 million marks ($523 million) as a result of write-downs when bond deals worth 6 billion marks ($3.9 billion) it conducted with 25 French banks turned sour.</p>
<p>The deals were so controversial that they at one point looked set to upset Germany's financial relations with France.</p>
