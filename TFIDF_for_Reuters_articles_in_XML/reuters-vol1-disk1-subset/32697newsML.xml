<p>U.S. blue chips ended mildly higher as investors looked past the conflict in Iraq and a soft bond market to a key economic indicator due Friday.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose nine points to close unofficially at 5657, despite session-long weakness in U.S. Treasuries ahead of Friday's payroll and unemployment report.</p>
<p>&quot;The equity market is taking the view that strength in the economy implies third-quarter earnings might hold up relatively well,&quot; said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.  </p>
<p>Analysts said investors have adopted an especially cautious approach ahead of the jobs report, which many economists believe holds the key to whether the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates any time soon.</p>
<p>&quot;At the present time both stocks and bonds are acting antsy about Friday's news,&quot; said Harry Laubscher, market analyst at Tucker Anthony. &quot;Investors are largely on the  sidelines in advance of the jobs data.&quot;</p>
<p>A fresh round of U.S. missile attacks on Iraqi targets early Wednesday continued to roil limited segments of the market, though oil stocks were only barely higher on the day.  </p>
<p>The energy-hungry transportation sector remained weak, and shares in U.S. airline companies were mostly lower for the second straight session. United Airlines parent company UAL Corp fell 1/2 to 47, and American Airlines parent AMR Corp dipped two points to 80.</p>
<p>Retail stocks got a boost after office product retailer Staples Inc agreed to acquire competitor Office Depot Inc in a deal that would create a company with more than $10 billion in annual revenues.  </p>
<p>Office Depot jumped 4-5/8 to 20-1/2 after the announcement, while Staples, which will pay 1.14 shares for each Office Depot share, fell 3/4 to 18-3/4.</p>
<p>The deal sparked strong demand for retail stocks. J.C. Penney Co Inc gained 1-7/8 to 55-1/2, May Department Stores Co gained 1-3/8 to 47-1/2 and Sears Roebuck &amp; Co rose 1-1/8 to 44-3/4.</p>
<p>&quot;You've had concern in that sector about too many competitors and margin erosion,&quot; Orlando said. &quot;This deal suggests managements recognize the potential problem and are going to enact the strategic consolidation that is needed.&quot;  </p>
<p>One stock that failed to participate in the retail rally was OfficeMax Inc, which slipped 5/8 to 13-1/8. The company, a direct competitor of Staples and Office Depot, said it may pursue acquisitions of its own.</p>
<p>Beyond the individual issues and sectors affected by special situations, stocks generally held to tight ranges in a waiting game that analysts expect will restrain the market through tomorrow's session.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid Inc fell 3-5/8 to 22-7/8 after warning investors that rising prices for raw materials will hurt its third-quarter earnings.  </p>
<p>Rubbermaid said it expected Q3 profit to be little changed from the $0.32 per share it earned a year ago. That compares with analysts' estimates of about $0.40 per share. The shares touched an intraday year-low of 22-1/8 during the session.</p>
<p>Computer-networking company 3Com Corp rose 1-1/4 to 48-1/8 after SoundView Financial raised its short-term rating on the shares to buy from hold and increased fiscal 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates for the company.</p>
<p>Financial software maker Intuit Inc slid 3-3/4 to 32-1/2 after Morgan Stanley slashed its 1997 earnings estimate on the company to $0.79 per share from $1.05.  </p>
<p>Aetna Inc jumped 2-1/8 to 67-1/8. The company said it expected pricing for its health maintenance organization plans will outpace medical cost increases.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.53 to 1143.82.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 0.89 to 655.61.</p>
