<p>Wolseley Plc, the UK building group, said on Tuesday it expected U.S. market conditions to improve but predicted tough European trading continuing after reporting a one percent slip in year pretax profits earlier.</p>
<p>Profits for the group slipped to 242.9 million stg from 245.4 million, beating analysts' forecasts which ranged from 230 to 240 million stg. The total dividend rose 5.6 percent to 10.35 pence and gearing fell sharply to 7.7 percent from 13.2 percent.  </p>
<p>Chairman Richard Ireland reported organic sales growth across all three divisions but said the fall in profits was due to &quot;poor economic conditions in mainland Europe and volatile lumber prices in the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The results for 1996 should be set against the background of economic difficulties in France and Austria and a flat home (UK) market.&quot;</p>
<p>The profit fall had been expected after a warning earlier this year and is in line with the rest of the sector which has suffered even more due to higher continental European exposure.  </p>
<p>The new chief executive John Young said in the results statement that &quot;there are so many exciting growth opportunities available,&quot; adding that &quot;We will continue to seek ways to add shareholder value by building on our strengths and expanding the geographical coverage and product range through selective acquisitions and growth.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking at a divisional breakdown of the results, building distribution in Europe saw turnover up 10 percent but trading profits fell six percent due to problems stemming from France and Austria and a modest slip in UK profits.</p>
<p>Though the UK was reported to be making slow progress.  </p>
<p>U.S. building distribution saw turnover rise 18.2 percent and trading profit by 10.8 percent. The division was assisted by acquisition sales.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and other activities sales rose 7.3 percent but trading profits slumped just over 16 percent due to one-off costs of four million stg at Ashley &amp; Rock and Antiference.</p>
<p>Uncertainties for the group ahead include the future levels of UK and U.S. interest rates said Wolseley, with expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten rates soon.</p>
<p>The U.S. businesses, accounting for around 50 percent of its revenues, is exposed to these interest rate risks.</p>
