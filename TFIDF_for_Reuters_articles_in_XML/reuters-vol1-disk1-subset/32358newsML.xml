<p>Italian information technology group Olivetti, shaken by steep losses and the sudden resignation of long-time Chairman Carlo De Benedetti, faces a tough recovery under its new chief, analysts said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company's stock jumped nearly 13 percent in early trading as the market reacted positively to what was seen as De Benedetti's defeat in a fierce duel for control with new Managing Director Francesco Caio.</p>
<p>But the stock rapidly subsided to close 3 percent higher as initial enthusiasm waned and caution over the future of the group, particularly its problematic PC company, set in.</p>
<p>&quot;Olivetti's problems have not been addressed, a lawyer has taken over as chairman ... and the results were awful,&quot; said one trader in Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;De Benedetti's resignation is positive but once people understand the complete value of Olivetti then the price fluctuation is more likely to be minus 10 than plus 10 percent,&quot; said broker Robert Meier of Pasfin Securities in Milan.</p>
<p>Olivetti said on Tuesday it had a 440.2 billion lire ($290.6 million) pre-tax loss for the first half of 1996, after a full-year consolidated loss of 1.598 trillion lire ($1.05 billion) in 1995.</p>
<p>It also made a 200 billion lire ($132 million) provision for restructuring and divestments deriving from its decision to &quot;accelerate the reduction of its presence in the hardware sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts took this to mean it wants to exit from the competitive PC sector, the area that made De Benedetti's name in the 1980s but proved a burden in the tougher 1990s climate.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old tycoon resigned late Tuesday. Caio, 39, who took over as managing director in July, had been hand-picked by De Benedetti to take charge of day-to-day management.</p>
<p>Industry analysts speculated that Caio, groomed in the world of U.S. management consultancy McKinsey and the global telecommunications industry, clashed with the autocratic style of De Benedetti, who had already rescued and transformed Olivetti once in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>For the previous 19 months, Caio had moulded Olivetti's 41.3 percent-owned cellular phone operator Omnitel into a true force in the Italian mobile phone world and a serious challenger to the dominant state-controlled Telecom Italia Mobile.</p>
<p>For some analysts, Caio did a good job guiding Omnitel to apparent early success. Others believe most of the credit should go to consortium partners, which included big U.S. telecommunications groups Airtouch and Bell Atlantic.</p>
<p>Caio is seen by analysts as the telecommunications man destined to push Olivetti even quicker toward telephone services and away from its old business of personal computers, office equipment and banking and retailing automation systems.</p>
<p>Major Olivetti institutional shareholders had become more and more disgruntled with De Benedetti's overbearing style, highlighted by a lack of financial information from the company base in the Italy's northwestern town of Ivrea.</p>
<p>De Benedetti bought into the money-losing typewriter company in 1978, transformed it into one of Europe's leading computer makers and was trying to turn it into a modern telecommunications player.</p>
<p>Olivetti has bled red ink for five years and it is Caio's task to keep it together until its telephone business starts producing profits to sustain the whole group.</p>
<p>Analysts said his main problem would be to persuade shareholders -- 70 percent of them from outside Italy -- to stick with him through the recovery phase as the stock price languishes near record lows.</p>
