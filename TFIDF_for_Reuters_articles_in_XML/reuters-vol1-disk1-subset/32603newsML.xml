<headline>U.S. crudes ease late on Iraq, finds API support.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. crudes eased Wednesday on diminished concerns over Iraqi troop incursions but were later aided by relatively large draws in overall crude oil stocks.</p>
<p>News that Iraqi troops had pulled out of Kurdish regions in northern Iraq after U.S. air strikes later in the day, brought NYMEX crude prices down from morning highs.</p>
<p>Outright prices also revived on American Petroleum Institute (API) data showing a 5.6 million barrel draw in crude stocks and a drop in imports to 6.7 million barrels.</p>
<p>October West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was at $23.20-30 a barrel, with the Oct/Nov roll steady around 70 cts.  </p>
<p>Domestic trade was moderately active in narrowly softer ranges with activity spread across the grades.</p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James moved several times at WTI plus 33 cents, barely changed from Tuesday. WTI/Midland traded between plus eight and 10 cents, modestly softer than Tuesday.</p>
<p>Eugene Island was done at a negative $1.03 and $1.05 to WTI/Cushing, while West Texas Sour/Midland moved at minus $1.20/1.22, both at relatively stable levels.</p>
<p>WTI/Cushing Postings Plus was the most active, trading between $2.33 and $2.41, and drawing refiner short covering amid a steeper price backwardation recently.</p>
<p>Elswehere, Hurricane Fran threatening the U.S. Atlantic coast also lent some psychological support, although no disruptions were reported to refinery operations or shipping.</p>
