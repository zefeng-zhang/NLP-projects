<p>The end of the Canadian Auto Workers strike against General Motors Corp after only 19 days means the work stoppage had only a minor impact on the U.S. economy, economists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Canadian industrial production will be severely hurt by the strike, but &quot;U.S. figures won't be anywhere near there.&quot; said David Sloan, economist at consulting firm I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if U.S. auto sales and output will be adversely affected in late October and possibly early November by this strike,&quot; Sloan said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'll see some slightly weak auto sales and industrial production figures for the U.S. in October,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, GM and the Canadian Auto Workers union said they had reached a tentative agreement to end the nearly three-week-old strike at GM's Canadian plants by 26,000 Canadian workers. The strike also idled as many as 19,931 GM workers in the United States and Mexico, GM said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The agreement included a pledge by GM to limit sub-contracting, or outsourcing, and the sale of facilities.  </p>
<p>The union conceded that GM's business plan might require it to deviate from an agreement reached in September with Chrysler Corp. that was intended to set an industry pattern.</p>
<p>James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities, said the number of people laid off in the U.S. as a result of the Canadian work stoppage was &quot;too small to have much of an effect on anything other than a few weeks of jobless claims.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;There should be only limited, transitory effects on the initial (jobless) claims (data) and October payroll reports and no direct effect on the November payroll report,&quot; agreed analysts at MMS International.</p>
<p>Glassman said the strike probably swelled the number of new claims for state unemployment insurance in the latest week by five or six thousand.</p>
<p>New jobless claims totaled 340,000 in the week ended October 12.</p>
<p>Glassman said it is difficult to disentangle claims filed because of the GM strike from other claims.  </p>
<p>&quot;GM facilities are all over the place,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>The impact on the October employment report will also be limited because the Labor Department conducted the workweek survey in the pay period that included October 12.</p>
<p>&quot;Not many GM workers were idle then,&quot; said Glassman. &quot;Things didn't really deteriorate until last week.&quot;</p>
<p>One aspect of the October employment report, the length of the average workweek, might be affected.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of hours logged may have been depressed a little,&quot; said Glassman. &quot;These autoworkers work a lot of overtime.&quot;  </p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, &quot;We're only talking about 10,000 workers in that period so on average, it might not be that big a deal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The negative impact on October payrolls will be overwhelmed by the bounce from September's payroll job decline,&quot; said Sloan who estimates non-farm payrolls will grow by 200,000 jobs in October.</p>
<p>&quot;It took a bit of time for U.S. plants to be impacted (by the 19-day Canadian strike),&quot; said Slaon. &quot;Most of the U.S. plant layoffs came after the payroll survey.&quot;</p>
<p>Slaon said the strike could adversely impact the number of hours worked -- but just in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the strike will be a huge factor for U.S. data,&quot; said Sloan. &quot;It will probably be a minor factor.&quot;</p>
