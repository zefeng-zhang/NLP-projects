<p>U.S. investment-grade corporate bond spreads were under pressure to tighten on the long-end as U.S. Treasuries sold off, but slow trade prevented any substantial outperformance, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;A few of the longer issues tried to tighten a basis point or two because the market's off a half on the long end, but there's just so little trading it's hard to tell,&quot; one high-grades dealer said.</p>
<p>On the junk bond side, Collins &amp; Aikman Products 11-1/2 percent notes due 2006 fell 1-1/2 to 102-1/2 on Wednesday's news it bought Foamex International's JPS Automotive unit.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they expect virtually stagnant trade on Friday ahead of the last long U.S. weekend this summer.</p>
<p>The primary market was quiet with no deals priced or expected to price on Friday.</p>
<p>The new issue calendar will remain thin until after the U.S. employment report is released next Friday, September 6, syndicate sources said.</p>
