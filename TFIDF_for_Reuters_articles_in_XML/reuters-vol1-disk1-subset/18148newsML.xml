<p>Egyptian share prices hit an 18-month high in active trading on Wednesday as new investors continued to buy, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index closed 0.52 points higher at 234.81 after shares worth 45.96 million pounds ($13.5 million) changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Many newcomers are buying big volumes,&quot; said broker Sherif Cararah of Financial Brokerage Group. &quot;It will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Watany Bank of Egypt, the most active share, rose 1.99 pounds to end at 27.00 pounds after more than 50,000 shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Milling shares continued to dominate activity with Central Egypt Flour Mills down 0.99 pounds to 25 pounds after 11,349 shares changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Central performed well in anticipation of good results,&quot; Cararah said. There were rumours yesterday that the firm had increased net profits for 1995/69 by 30 percent.</p>
<p>North Cairo Flour Mills closed 0.01 pounds up at 94.35 pounds after some 22,000 shares were traded.</p>
