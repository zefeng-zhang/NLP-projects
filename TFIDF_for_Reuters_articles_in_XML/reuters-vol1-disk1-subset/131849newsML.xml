<p>The Australian dollar surged to a near five year peak in trade weighted terms Monday as investors fled low interest rate climes for higher yielding havens.</p>
<p>The yen, mark and Swiss franc were shunned en masse propelling the local currency to 59.1 on its trade weighted index, the first venture above 59.0 since November 1991.</p>
<p>The yen was the biggest casualty as the Bank of Japan made it clear rates there would remain at record low levels. The dollar stormed to a four year high in response and was within a whisker of clearing the psychologically crucial 90.00 barrier.  </p>
<p>By 4.45 pm (0645 GMT) the local dollar had climbed to 89.92/02 yen, its best level since September 1992, from 89.12/22 late here Friday. The latest rally brough the dollar's gains so far this year to more than 13 yen or 17 percent.</p>
<p>Flows were more subdued against the U.S. dollar, but the local unit still inched up to US$0.7970/75 from an early U$0.7952/57 and US$0.7943/48 late Friday.</p>
<p>The break of technical resistance at US$0.7965, which had capped the currency from more than five weeks, was seen as bullish and should open the way for a test of the US$0.8000/8020 chart band this week, dealers said.  </p>
<p>But it was on the crosses where all the real action lived and where the greatest scope for gains were seen.</p>
<p>The main driving force was the hunger for higher returns by Japanese investors faced with record low interest rates at home. That had shown signs of faltering recently as speculation grew of a cut in Australian rates, but a warning on the inflationary danger of wages growth from the Reserve Bank last week made a policy easing seem less of a sure thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, traders said signs of a slowing in the Japanese economy had convinced retail investors there that rates would remain painfully low for some months to come.  </p>
<p>Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita explicitly recognised that on Monday saying monetary policy would continue to emphasise making Japan's economic recovery more solid.</p>
<p>In response the 10-year JGB benchmark bond future for December surged to an all-time high of 123.70, while the yield on the physical bond slid to 2.745 percent from 2.805 Friday.</p>
<p>The equivalent Australian bond pays 7.50 percent.</p>
<p>It also made it very attractive for professional investors to borrow in yen and lend in higher yielding currencies and there was talk of a revival in A$-denominated dual currency samurai issues with up to A$600 million rumoured for this week.  </p>
<p>&quot;Even when the flow of A$ samurais fell off in the last few weeks, AUD/yen supported itself and that's got to be bullish,&quot; said a dealer at Chase Manhattan here.</p>
<p>&quot;It's also caught a lot of people short and looks like forcing a break of this huge 90.00 barrier.&quot;</p>
<p>Once past there, it only took a small leap of imagination to reach the 100.00 yen target, a level not visited since May 1992. The strength on the yen saw the local dollar jump on its trade weighted index -- the yen makes up almost 20 percent of the basket of currencies -- to 59.1 from 58.8 late Friday.</p>
<p>The way ahead was not without potential pitfalls, however.  </p>
<p>The chief risk remained a cut in domestic interest rates, which was thought a real possibility if wages and inflation data later this week proved as subdued as some expect.</p>
<p>Wages figures would be particularly crucial given the RBA's concern at the growth in private sector pay settelments.</p>
<p>Average weekly ordinary time earnings are expected to rise 1.0 percent in Q3, but that would still see annual growth slow to 3.7 percent from 3.9 percent in Q2. Q3 consumer price data are due Wednesday and again analysts expect annual underlying inflation to slow to 2.5 percent from 3.1 percent, well within the RBA's 2-3 percent target range. --Sydney newsroom 9373 1800</p>
