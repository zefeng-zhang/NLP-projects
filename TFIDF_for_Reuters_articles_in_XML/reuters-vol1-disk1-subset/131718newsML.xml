<p>Vietnam plans to raise rice output to 30 million tonnes by 2000 from 25.5 million in 1996 to meet growing domestic and export demand, Dutch agri-bank Rabobank said in a report.</p>
<p>But Vietnamese government measures have failed to attract the necessary foreign investment, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The two corporations set up to control the sector imply limited freedom for other companies and new investors may be deterred by this,&quot; it said in a study on Vietnam's agribusiness.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese government has initiated policies to increase rice growing areas and yields, but its overriding concern of securing domestic food supplies has meant export restrictions.</p>
<p>It has refused to licence exports at certain prices and uses export quotas to secure domestic food supplies. In 1996 the export quota was two million tonnes and licences were granted to 15 exporters.</p>
<p>Vietnam also has a major problem with illegal rice exports, mainly to China.</p>
<p>Rabobank said that in 1995 17 percent of total rice exports to China were official, whereas unofficial transit accounted for 24 percent, although the figures may have been extreme because of rice shortages in China, Philippines and Indonesia that year.</p>
<p>&quot;Smuggling may become even more important because an ever smaller number of exporters will be granted licences and may even be pushed out of the market by the two Vinafood companies that are due to control the trade in future,&quot; Rabobank said.</p>
<p>The rice industry in Vietnam also has an image problem -- caused by its reputation for defaulting on contracts and the selling of rice of poor and inconsistent quality.</p>
<p>The quality of exported rice may have improved significantly but the study noted &quot;the reputation for not fulfilling contracts may persist since Vietnam gives priority to domestic food supply rather than exports so there will always be a risk of a ban.&quot;</p>
<p>Rabobank concluded that improvements to quality indicated that Vietnam had the potential to become a quality rice exporter but substantial investment was needed.</p>
<p>It also sounded a note of caution.</p>
<p>&quot;It still remains the question whether rice really is a sector that is capable of attracting foreign investors because not much value addition can be achieved,&quot; the report said.</p>
