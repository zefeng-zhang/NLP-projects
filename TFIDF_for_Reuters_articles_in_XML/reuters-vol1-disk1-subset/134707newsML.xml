<p>The Asian air cargo industry is moving into &quot;a golden era of growth&quot; but would first have to overcome three key issues to make the most of this growth, J.J. Ong, general manager cargo sales at Malaysian Airlines Bhd said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Asian cargo market is certain to see double-digit growth till at least the 21st century ... within the next 20 years cargo involving Asia will constitute over half the world's total,&quot; he told the 18th Air Cargo Forum on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But there are three key issues facing the Asian airfreight industry, Ong added and the first of these is influence of new technology and Asia's ability to cope with the changes.</p>
<p>These include vast new cargo handling facilities. Hong Kong's new airport will be able to handle 2.6 million tonnes in 1998, the new Malaysian airport at Sepang will have one million tonnes with room for expansion of up to three million tonnes, Singapore's sixth cargo terminal will add 800,000 tonnes capacity in 2000, while Ho Chi Minh City will have a new one million tonnes by 2010.</p>
<p>He said there are also &quot;an estimated 43 airport projects, either planned or underway in China to accomodate the projected growth of 11 percent a year over the next 20 years.&quot;</p>
<p>This infrastructure development is accompanied by investment in technology such as bar-coding, electronic data interchange and cargo community systems, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate implication of these investments is a direct increase in the cost of operations. This may lessen the competitive edge of Asia, which they have enjoyed so far -- that is to be a low-cost operator and quality provider,&quot; Ong added.</p>
<p>It means changes in how things are done and in a short space of time, he added. It will involve training, development of skilled staff and business process re-engineering.</p>
<p>&quot;Workforces in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong are relatively well-equipped to handle this change,&quot; But other fast developing countries in Asia such as &quot;Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and to some extent Thailand, Malaysia and India would find these changes too much to cope with and could very well suffer the setback of under-utilising and or nullifying the technological changes created,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The other issues are threats from the integrators and overcapacity. Asian airlines &quot;are compelled to cooperate cohesively forming alliances and parnterships with one another as well as act as ground support service provider in order to survive,&quot; Ong said.</p>
<p>&quot;An explosion in freighter use and the steady injection of passenger flights had led to overcapacity&quot; he said, but &quot;we hope common sense will prevail as far as the increase of capacity to Asia is concerned&quot; so that demand for space can catch up. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
