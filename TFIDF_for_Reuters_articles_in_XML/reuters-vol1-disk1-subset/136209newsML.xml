<p>Electronic Data Systems Corp said Wednesday it expects less new business so far this year, coupled with an anticipated drop in government spending, to put pressure on its growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Electronic Data Systems signed $2.81 billion in new business in the third quarter and $5.37 billion for the first nine months of the year, down from $6.58 billion in new business in the first nine months of the prior year.</p>
<p>The company did not offer a firm estimate on the potential effect of those two factors on its fourth quarter results.  </p>
<p>The information services firm, which earlier reported financial results for the first full quarter since it was split off from General Motors Corp, also disclosed it had a gross outstanding receivable from Memorex Telex of approximately $24 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Memorex Telex Corp, an EDS customer, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on October 15 and announced it was seeking to liquidate and sell its U.S. assets in their entirety.</p>
<p>EDS said it is too early to determine the amount of EDS' recovery, if any, in this bankruptcy proceeding.  </p>
<p>As reported, EDS earned a profit of $266.4 million or $0.55 a share in the third quarter, up from $245.7 million or $0.51 share. Operating revenues increased 16.2 percent over year-ago levels to $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>EDS signed $2.81 billion in new business in the third quarter, bringing to $5.37 billion the total for the first nine months of 1996, compared with $6.58 billion in the first three quarters of last year. EDS said the somewhat lower level of new business signed year to date, coupled with anticipated reduced government spending, is expected to put some pressure on the rate of financial growth in the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p>&quot;Additionally, the fourth quarter of 1995 provides a challenging basis for comparison, since it was the best quarter in EDS' 34-year history,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>The company which was founded by Texas billionaire Ross Perot in 1962, sold to GM in 1984 and split off from the automaker earlier this year, reported a profit of $269.5 million of $0.56 a share on revenues of $3.62 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts had expected EDS to report a fourth quarter profit of $0.63 a share.</p>
<p>Shares of EDS were off two to 57-1/2.</p>
