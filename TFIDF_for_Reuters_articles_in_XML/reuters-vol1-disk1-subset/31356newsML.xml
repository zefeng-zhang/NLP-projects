<p>Queen's Park Rangers, relegated from the English premier division last season, parted company on Wednesday with manager Ray Wilkins.</p>
<p>&quot;Ray and the board of QPR...reluctantly came to the decision that it would be in the best interests of both parties to start afresh whilst the season is still in its early days,&quot; the club said.</p>
<p>Former England midfielder Wilkins, 39, took over from present Tottenham Hotspurs manager Gerry Francis in November, 1994.</p>
<p>He steered Rangers to eighth place in his first season of management but found the goals dried up when striker Les Ferdinand transferred to Newcastle last year.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been involved in professional football for over 20 years and I can honestly say that this is the hardest situation I have ever had to deal with,&quot; Wilkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;As to my own future, I will be having some time out with my family before reaching a decision as to where it lies.&quot;</p>
