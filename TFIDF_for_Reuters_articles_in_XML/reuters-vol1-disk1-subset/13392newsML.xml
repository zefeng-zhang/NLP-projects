<p>The dollar ended European trading sharply down against the mark and yen on Monday with the markets nervous over Tokyo's monetary direction ahead of a key Japanese economic survey due this week.</p>
<p>The dollar at the close had slipped by nearly a pfennig and a yen compared with Friday's levels in dealings that were subdued because British markets were shut for a seasonal holiday.</p>
<p>The weaker dollar had a depressing effect on the main European bourses, which ended down after business that was quiet because of London's closure. A poor performance on Wall Street did nothing to dispel the gloom.</p>
<p>The dollar's closing level of 107.55 yen compared to Friday's 108.50was prompted by a growing uncertainty over the direction of Japan's monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey on companies' expectations of future business is out on Wednesday and is regarded as an important reference for formulating monetary policy.</p>
<p>Although few expect the survey to change Japan's steady monetary policy stance, markets become nervous because the lower the Tankan's index, the cloudier the outlook.</p>
<p>The dollar, which began sliding against the mark last week as euphoria over a German interest rate cut fizzled out, fell further on Monday to end at 1.4789 marks versus Friday's figure of 1.4871.</p>
<p>The mark ended stronger against most European currencies as well, gaining slightly against the French franc and posting hefty gains on the lira because of renewed uncertainty about the single European currency proposed to begin in 1999.</p>
<p>Mark/lira was trading at 1021.85 from 1018.82 on Friday.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said in La Repubblica newspaper that Italy did not want a revision of the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>Prodi's comments come after a weekend newspaper interview by his deputy, Walter Veltroni, who said that Italy and other European countries should consider the possibility of a Maastricht re-think.</p>
<p>But at the same time the Swiss franc strengthened to a four-month high against the mark despite the Swiss National Bank's moves to add liquidity to the money markets, which would tend to mean lower interest rates.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German stocks ended almost unchanged from Friday's closing price after a listless session. The mood was depressed by the weaker dollar and the holiday in London.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a morgue out there, everything's dead. Hopefully by the end of next week things will begin to fill up again,&quot; said one Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>In after-hours business, trading on the computerised IBIS index was also down near the close.</p>
<p>French shares drifted to end the day slightly lower after dull trading which traders said lacked direction following the French and German rate cuts of last week.</p>
<p>Last Thursday and Friday, the bourse rose after the Bank of France cut its intervention rate to 3.35 percent following a surprise Bundesbank repo rate cut.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen in late European dealings compared with 1.4871 marks and 108.50 yen at the London close on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS</p>
<p>London's stock market was closed for a Public Holiday. On Friday the FTSE 100 closed at 3,907.5 up 16.4 points.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished down 0.40 points at 2,020.42.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed down 2.80 at 2,552.36.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was stronger at $388.75 on the international market versus $387.50 at Friday's London close.</p>
