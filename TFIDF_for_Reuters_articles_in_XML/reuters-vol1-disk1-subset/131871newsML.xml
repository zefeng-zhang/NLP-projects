<headline>UBS Australia sees rally in NZ dollar, 10-yr bonds.</headline>

<p>New Zealand's 10-year bond yield should test 7.25 percent this year and 7.0 percent in 1997 regardless of whether a National-led or a Labour-led government emerges from coalition negotiations, international economist Stephen Roberts of UBS Australia said on Monday.</p>
<p>In his Australian and New Zealand market outlook, Roberts also said that the New Zealand dollar would test 72 U.S. cents in the first half of 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;The 10 year bond yield should be able to fall to around 7.25 percent in the coalition government discussion phase, with potential to test 7.0 percent in 1997 under either a National or a Labour coalition government,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>He said the strong rally in the 10-year bond since the October 12 election reflected the lack of a real threat to the key economic reforms of the past 12 years and a very low 12 month inflation outlook, confirmed by better-then-expected September quarter inflation data and the Reserve Bank's anti-inflationary response.  </p>
<p>The market had also been subject to a significant squeeze because of a lack of stock.</p>
<p>&quot;The long regime of very tight monetary policy will keep economic activity subdued in 1997 and will push annual inflation well below 2.0 percent,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>Roberts said the 90-day bank bill yield would stay above 9.5 percent until at least mid-December and, following the formation of a government, the New Zealand dollar would appreciate to a level commensurate with its very high yield support.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given the expansionary stance that would develop under a National government and the somewhat more expansionary stance that would develop under a Labour government, a key for the New Zealand dollar outlook is that even when the RBNZ starts to ease monetary conditions in 1997, New Zealand's short term interest rates will still be high by international comparison,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the New Zealand dollar trading against the U.S. dollar between 0.6950 and 0.7100 during the coalition government establishment phase, ahead of a push up to 0.7200 in the first half of 1997.&quot;  --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746</p>
