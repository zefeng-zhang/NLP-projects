<p>French President Jaqcues Chirac left Damascus on Monday for Israel after a visit described by President Hafez al-Assad as successful.</p>
<p>Officials said Assad, who gave the French leader a warm welcome during a visit that started on Saturday, saw Chirac off at the airport after a brief meeting on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Assad said at a joint news conference with Chirac on Sunday the French president had improved bilateral ties and had Syria's endorsement for taking a bigger role in Syrian-Israeli peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Chirac succeeded in his mission in Syria and we hope that others (Israeli leaders) cooperate with him to make his mission a success,&quot; Assad said.</p>
<p>Syria's official media on Monday hailed Chirac's visit. The official daily Tishreen said it advanced both Middle East peace and bilateral relations.</p>
<p>However, Israel was quick to reject Chirac's call for giving Europe a larger role in the peace talks.</p>
<p>Chirac, declaring that peace was in danger, said he wanted to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, suspended since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
<p>Chirac also announced that France and Syria had signed an agreement on Syria's debt. He said it ended a decade-old dispute over a 1.8 billion French francs ($350 million) debt that had stopped French financial aid and export credit guarantees.</p>
