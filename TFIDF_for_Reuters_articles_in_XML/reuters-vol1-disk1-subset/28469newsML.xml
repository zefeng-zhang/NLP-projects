<headline>Blue-chip stocks roar back from sharp losses.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks rebounded smartly Tuesday from steep early losses sparked by the U.S. missile attack on Iraq and fears of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 16.64 points at 5,632.85 after rallying from a deep sell-off of more than 50 points.</p>
<p>But in the broader market, declining issues led advances 2-1 on moderate volume of 208 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index lost 3.21 points to 1,138.29.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 7.11 percent from 7.12 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Analysts said a key economic indicator -- the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for August -- calmed fears of higher interest rates. The index came in at 52.6 compared with Wall Street's forecast of 52.9.</p>
<p>Earlier, the U.S. missile attack on Iraq and worries of higher interest rates rattled the market, sending the Dow index tumbling just eight minutes after the opening bell.</p>
<p>Peter Canelo, Dean Witter's chief investment strategist, said concerns about economic growth and a possible hike in rates by the Federal Reserve were the most serious factors facing the market.</p>
<p>He cited recent data, including strong durable goods orders and sharply higher new homes sales, pointing to an economy stronger than many analysts expected.</p>
<p>Canelo said the uncertainty surrounding interest rates prompted Dean Witter on Tuesday to cut its stock and bond allocations by 5 percent each, opting for cash.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed is really behind the curve, and they don't really have a choice on whether they will raise rates by a one-quarter or a one-half point,&quot; he said. &quot;The market is not yet priced to handle that kind of a hike.&quot;</p>
<p>Canelo said the stock market faced volatility and uncertainty in the three weeks between now and the Sept. 24 meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Fed will look for any reason to stay away from tightening monetary policy at the next meeting,&quot; due to the coming election, said Roy Blumberg, chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross.</p>
<p>Canelo said the situation in Iraq was &quot;less serious than some people would think. I don't believe it has major implications for the economy or for inflation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Oil prices rocketed after news of the missile attacks by the United States in southern Iraq, in retaliation for Baghdad's army offensive in Kurdish regions in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>October crude oil was up 86 cents at $23.11 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange after initially soaring by more than $1.70 to a post-Gulf-War high.</p>
<p>The shares of major oil companies rose, with Chevron Corp. up 1-1/8 to 60, Texaco Inc. up 2-7/8 at 91-5/8, Exxon Corp., up 2-1/8 at 83-1/2 and Mobil Corp. up 2-3/4 at 115-1/2.</p>
<p>Airline stocks were mauled on expected price increases for jet fuel.</p>
<p>Among the big losers, Delta Air Lines dropped 1-3/4 to 69-1/8, AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, fell 1-3/8 to 80-5/8, United Airline's parent UAL Corp. lost 1 to 47, and Trans World Airlines Inc. was off 3/4 to 12-5/8.</p>
