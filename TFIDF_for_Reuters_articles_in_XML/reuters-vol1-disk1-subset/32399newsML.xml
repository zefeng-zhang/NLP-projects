<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch bonds closed a touch higher on Wednesday with prices lingering at closing levels for most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dealers said weaker than expected U.S. construction spending failed to boost trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure was better than expected,&quot; said a dealer after the U.S. announced a 1.4 percent fall in construction spending in July. &quot;But oddly enough there was no reaction in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said Thursday German unemployment data could have some impact, but most market players were waiting for Friday's U.S. August jobs data.  </p>
<p>The consensus for August U.S. payrolls is set at 244,000, with forecasts ranging from 150,000 to 280,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We are holding our breath for those figures,&quot; said one dealer, adding the market could not afford a figure of 275,000 or higher.</p>
<p>Another dealer said he expected more swapping from guilder bonds into German debt if the yield gap keeps widening.</p>
<p>The January 2006 bond rose 0.12 to 97.88/96, with a bid yield of 6.30 percent or nine basis points below the April 2006 versus minus eight on Tuesday.</p>
