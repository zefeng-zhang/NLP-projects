<p>High unemployment and weak consumer confidence tipped France's economy into a downturn in the second quarter, underlining the tough task faced by the government as it prunes budget deficits ahead of European monetary union.</p>
<p>National statistics institute INSEE said gross domestic product fell 0.4 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter after rising 1.1 percent in the first quarter, when the economy rebounded from a public sector strike late last year.</p>
<p>The poor data was released as the government finalises a 1997 budget which will cut taxes to encourage consumption while also reducing public spending to bring down the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Economic recovery is vital if the government is to meet its target of reducing the deficit to three percent of gross domestic product next year to meet Maastricht Treaty standards.</p>
<p>INSEE said the second quarter decline was partly due to a one percent fall in consumer spending, hit by record unemployment which has sapped confidence, after a rise of  2.5 percent in the first quarter. This contributed 0.6 percentage points to the shrinkage in gross domestic product.</p>
<p>A smaller number of working days knocked some 0.5 percentage point off second quarter GDP after making an equivalent positive contribution in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Economists had expected a fall of 0.2 to 0.4 percent in reaction to the strong rise in the first quarter and said the economy should grow again in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;It's reasonable to expect a bounceback in the third quarter,&quot; Sean Shepley, economist at CS First Boston, said.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the third quarter may be quite strong. The worse the number in the second quarter, the stronger it will be in the third quarter, Philippe  Brossard, economist at ABN AMRO, said.</p>
<p>And the government, banking on recent interest rate cuts to fuel the recovery, emphasised that the economy was picking up.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen for a while some positive signs which give every reason to believe France is in the process of a progressive economic recovery,&quot; government spokesman Alain Lamassoure told reporters.</p>
<p>He added that the government's growth target of 1.3 percent for the year was still within reach.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to consolidate and encourage the economic recovery. It is obviously with this in mind that we are putting the final touches to the 1997 budget bill,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget, due to be presented to the cabinet on September 18, will cut income tax by at least 20 billion francs next year -- the start of a five-year overhaul of taxation.</p>
<p>But economists cautioned that the economy appears to be see-sawing quarter by quarter from recovery to shrinkage and back to recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem now is the fourth quarter. With all the gloom we have at the moment, the risk is that we have a bad fourth quarter because of the confidence factor,&quot; Brossard said.</p>
<p>That could put the government on a shaky footing as it enters 1997 -- the crucial year for deciding which countries will join a single currency when it is first launched in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes the three percent (1997 budget deficit/GDP ratio) a bit more risky. But at the moment three percent seems to me quite credible,&quot; Brossard said.</p>
<p>The government is pulling out all the stops to ensure it meets its target next year.</p>
<p>Among ideas being considered is to include in the deficit calculation around 37.5 billion francs in funds due to be tranferred to the state from France Telecom next year when it assumes its pension liabilities ahead of partial privatisation.</p>
<p>While that money will be earmarked for future pension payments, it could help tip the balance in the calculation of the 1997 budget deficit/GDP ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;The point is not whether we think these are prudent accounting practices, because they are not. However, if they allow France to come pretty close to the three percent of GDP budget deficit target, the single currency will come into existence on schedule,&quot; Smith Barney said in a research note.</p>
<p>&quot;France is putting all its eggs in the 1999 EMU basket. It suggests there is no serious thought being given to delaying EMU, because otherwise it would not be worth using up one-off gimmicks in 1997 that, as a consequence, will not be available later,&quot; it said.</p>
