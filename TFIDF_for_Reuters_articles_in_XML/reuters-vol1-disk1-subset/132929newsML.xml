<p>UK employment may dwindle over the next year but, longer term, the employment level should increase as firms continue to take advantage of flexible working practices, the Institute of Management (IM) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Forty-three percent of British executives who responded to the survey said they expect employment levels to fall in their organistions over the next year compared with 28 percent who expect it to rise.</p>
<p>But they were more optimistic of for the long-term outlook with 45 percent expecting employment levels to rise over the next four years compared with 38 percent who saw them falling.  </p>
<p>&quot;This optimism is a result of the increasing use of flexible working practices in the UK,&quot; said the annual survey of long-term employment strategies published by IM and Manpower, the UK employment services company.</p>
<p>&quot;The core/complementary model of flexible employment patterns is rapidly developing as employers seek ways of reducing costs and gaining competitive advantage,&quot; the survey said.</p>
<p>The core/complementary model features a slimmed down permanent workforce and increased use of third party contractors, part-time staff and temporary workers.</p>
<p>The survey found 78 percent of the UK's leading employers currently use part-time and temporary workers and 79 percent contract out non-core operations.</p>
<p>Over half the employers said they expect to use non-core staff to meet skills shortages in the future, but around the same number of firms said a two-tier workforce could emerge if &quot;complementary&quot; staff are not offered the same pay and benefits as core staff.</p>
