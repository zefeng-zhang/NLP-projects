<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul stocks close up, but far off day's high.</title>

<p>Stocks closed slightly higher on Monday after institutional selling in the afternoon session wiped out most of early gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite index ended at 832.62, up 1.44 points on the day, but far off an intra-day high of 844.51.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a strong selling pressure at the 840 point level,&quot; said LG Securities broker Koh Soon-shik. &quot;The market will need some time to absorb the selling pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>The strong mood in early in the day was attributed to the launch of a new employee savings programme with tax benefits on those willing to invest in the stock market, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Advancing shares beat decliners by 513 to 365, with 134 stocks remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;The index rise was small because of losses of blue chips and large-cap shares,&quot; said Koh. Large-cap stocks are heavily weighted on the index.</p>
<p>Among blue chips, Samsung Electronics fell 2,000 won to 65,500 and Hyundai Motor shed 400 won to 28,600. Bucking the large-cap weakeness, Korea Electric Power Corp gained 200 won to 26,700 and Pohang Iron and Steel Co was up 100 won to 44,700.</p>
<p>The bribery scandal involving former defence minister Lee Yang-ho had little impact on the market, brokers said.  </p>
<p>State prosecutors launched an investigation of the scandal, sparked by allegations from opposition lawmakers that Lee had leaked classified military secrets to an arms dealer in return for bribes.</p>
<p>Hyundai Securities gained 1,000 won to its daily limit of 17,700 on a newspaper report that the government was considering allowing Hyundai Group to take a controlling stake in Citizens Investment Trust Management Co.</p>
<p>The government denied the report, but investors continued buying the shares, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Kyongnam Bank fell 200 won to 10,300 on the bank's announcement of a loan fraud. The bank said on Saturday that documents submitted by 14 firms to which it had extended 10.7 billion won in loans had proved to be fraudulent.</p>
<p>The index futures December contracts closed 0.50 points lower at 87.20 while the KOSPI-200 index fell 0.25 points to close at 87.30.</p>
