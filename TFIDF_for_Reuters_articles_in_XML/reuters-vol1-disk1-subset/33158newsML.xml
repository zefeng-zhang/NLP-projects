<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares closed higher on Wednesday with most price gains made in the first few minutes as trading fizzled out in the absence of new impetus.</p>
<p>The AEX index ended at 554.16 points, up 3.18 points on the previous close but not enough to erase Tuesday's losses.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not a lot going on but we had a good move and sustained it the whole way,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Market leader Royal Dutch added 3.80 to 256.60 guilders in the wake of the surge in oil prices after U.S. attacks on Iraqi military targets in the last two days.</p>
<p>Consumer products giant Unilever gained 6.40 to 248.90.  </p>
<p>The strong move by Unilever, the index's second largest constituent, was attributed to a delayed reaction to a Monday newspaper report it planned to review underperforming assets.</p>
<p>&quot;As the price moves up, other people react to the news. They don't want to miss the boat,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Brewer Heineken bounced back from recent weakness to end 2.20 guilders higher at 370.60, but smaller rival Grolsch shed 0.50 to 69.50 after an as-expected 11 pct half-year profit rise.</p>
<p>Packaging group Van Leer lost 0.70 to 32.20 after going ex a final 0.25 guilder dividend, but financial stocks including ABN AMRO and Aegon gained in line with the bond market.  </p>
<p>One trader said he expected Royal Dutch shares to ease tomorrow as he believed the response to the Iraqi conflict to date was overdone.</p>
<p>Another expected flat trading on Thursday as market players, nervous about the possibility of another U.S. interest rate hike, awaited U.S. August payrolls data on Friday.</p>
<p>But chartists said the index was tracing out a reverse head and shoulders pattern which could see it breaking up through resistance at 570 toward targets at 590, 600 and 610 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, you should be very bullish,&quot; said one.</p>
