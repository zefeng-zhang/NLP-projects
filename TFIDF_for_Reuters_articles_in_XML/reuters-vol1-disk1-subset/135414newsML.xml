<p>The Philippine government plans to privatise the country's state-controlled pension funds, finance secretary Roberto de Ocampo said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to be part of our third wave of privatisation,&quot; De Ocampo told reporters late on Monday.</p>
<p>The Philippines runs two pensions funds, the Government Service Insurance System for government employees and the Social Security System for private sector employees.</p>
<p>&quot;The pension system is being reviewed and we are taking note of various models to see if any are adaptable (to the Philippines),&quot; De Ocampo told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The other part of this privatisation is to see if other social services like hospitals and schools ... can benefit from privatisation,&quot; De Ocampo said.</p>
<p>The finance secretary said he described this as the third wave because the goverment's programme had begun with the divestment of stakes in firms which were orginally in the private sector but later came under state control.</p>
<p>The second phase involves infrastructure firms like the National Power Corp (Napocor) and the Metropolitan Water Works and Sewerage System (MWSS).  </p>
<p>The MWSS privatisation would be completed by the end of the year while Napocor would begin the process next year, he said.</p>
<p>De Ocampo said that linked to the privatisation was the government's objective of cutting the size of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>With firms going out of state conrol &quot;we no longer need a bigger workforce, so we'll have a smaller bureacracy which hopefully will be better paid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB), said in a recent report that the Philippines' privatisation programme launched in 1993 has helped the government correct the growing public sector resource imbalance.</p>
<p>Privatisation has brought in revenues worth $1.9 billion in 1994 and $1.7 billion last year, it said, but expressed concern that most big ticket privatisations were over while the government did not yet have a sustainable source of revenue.</p>
<p>The government says it is working on it and is hoping a new tax package will be in place by the end of the year.</p>
