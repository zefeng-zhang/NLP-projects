<p>		NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:</p>
<p>Initial Public Offering:</p>
<p>    Note 1:   On July 26, 1996, the Company sold, through an</p>
<p>underwritten initial public offering, 1,890,907 shares of its Common Stock at $10.00 per share.  Upon closing of the Company's initial public offering, all outstanding shares of its Series A, C and D Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock were converted into 6,716,997 shares of Common Stock, after giving affect to the Company's 1 for 2.7059046 reverse stock split effected in July 1996.  The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 1996 and unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow for the six months ended June 30, 1996 reflect the impact of the initial public offering, the conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock and the repayment of $2.0 million in bank term notes as if they had occurred as of June 30, 1996.  All shares and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.</p>
<p>Net Loss Per Share:</p>
<p>    Note 2:   Net loss per share is computed using the</p>
<p>weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, except as noted below. Common equivalent shares from stock options and warrants are excluded from the computation as their effect is antidilutive, except that pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletins and Staff policy, common and preferred shares, options, and warrants issued during the period commencing 12 months prior to the initial filing of the initial public offering at prices below the public offering price are presumed to have been exercised in contemplation of the public offering and have been included in the calculation as if they were outstanding for all periods presented, determined using the treasury stock method and the price from the initial public offering.</p>
