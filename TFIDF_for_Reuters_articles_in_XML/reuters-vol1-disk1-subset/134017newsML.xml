<p>German shares closed bourse trade lower on Tuesday, weighed down by a weaker dollar and losses on Wall Street overnight and Japan's Nikkei index.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor dealings down 10.05 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,718.98. Dealers said they expected the index to consolidate for the rest of the week and said it was supported above the 2,700 point level.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX, which records all-day electronic trade in the DAX, ended down 11.93, or 0.44 percent, at 2,721.74 as a weak start on Wall Street cast a shadow across European bourses.</p>
<p>&quot;We're dependent on the trend in the U.S., now that we've had the German M3 (money supply) figures and business confidence data,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not seeing a consolidation where we drop down far, rather we're staying at the same levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the blue-chip shares Dresdner Bank was the day's top gainer, adding nearly two and a half percent, or 95 pfennigs, to 40.95 marks in IBIS trade, after investment bank Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on the firm to &quot;market outpeformer.&quot;</p>
<p>The rest of the banking sector was also buoyed by Dresdner's gains.</p>
<p>Preference shares in business software firm SAP AG ended IBIS dealings down 4.10 marks at 277.90, just before the company announced nine month sales of 2.372 billion marks, somewhat below expectations.</p>
<p>Retail group Metro AG lost almost three percent in computer trade, falling 3.90 marks to 133.13 after it said it would hold its goal of pre-tax profits of 1.0-1.1 billion marks despite continued weak consumer demand in the third quarter.</p>
<p>One of the day's main losers in IBIS dealings was dialysis group Fresenius Medical Care, which dropped 6.25 marks, or 4.5 percent, 132.40 marks, after the firm said it would issue $710 million in new preference shares and debt to repay bank debt.</p>
