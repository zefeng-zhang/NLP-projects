<p>North America's largest gold producer, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp, reported lower third-quarter earnings on Tuesday due to an after-tax charge and higher operating costs.</p>
<p>Barrick's net income for the quarter fell to $21 million, or 6 cents a share, from $67.7 million, or 19 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;I think their quarter clearly underscores that Barrick has made the transition from a growth company to one that's trying to maintain its existing base,&quot; said mining analyst Barry Allan of Gordon Capital.</p>
<p>Barrick pointed to higher cash costs, which rose to $203 an ounce from $194 an ounce a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company also took a $38 million hit to bail out of its Cerro Corona exploration project in Peru.</p>
<p>Barrick hiked its exploration budget more than 50 percent, to $46.4 million for the first nine months of the year, compared with $30.9 million previously.</p>
<p>Investors seemed to shrug that off. Barrick's shares rose C50 cents to C$36.15 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the stock rose 37.5 cents to $26.875.</p>
<p>The market seemed positive to Barrick's plans to develop its Pascua mine in Chile and its new Pierina property in Peru, analysts said.</p>
<p>Barrick bought the Pierina deposit last summer through its $800 million takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, based on a minimum of 4.5 million ounces of gold. According to the company, recent drilling on the property suggests the number was conservative.</p>
<p>Barrick said production at Pierina should begin in late 1999 at a rate of 500,000 ounces of gold a year. Costs should be below $100 an ounce thanks to a substantial silver credit and high grade gold.</p>
<p>Capital costs should be about $200 million, the company said. It has eight drills on the property working to define the deposit.</p>
<p>&quot;They are proceeding very aggressively on Pierina,&quot; Allan said. However, he cautioned that it was risky to make such claims while drilling was still underway and a feasibility study is still a long way off.</p>
<p>At Pascua in Chile, recent exploration suggests the deposit may extend across the nearby border into Argentina, Barrick said. Production is expected to begin in 1999, totalling 400,000 ounces a year at an operating cost of $240 per ounce. Capital costs are expected of about $475 million.</p>
