<p>Nearly 10 years after a racially-inspired coup set Fiji on a path of ethnic division, the island nation has reached a fork in that road.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who as military commander staged the 1987 coup, is leading a parliamentary committee working on a new constitution to replace the racially-biased document he introduced after the coup.</p>
<p>But nationalists in Fiji, and even some members of Rabuka's cabinet, oppose changing the constitution, which guarantees native Fijians a majority in the 70-seat parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is Fiji's last chance for a very long time. I think this really, truly is the crossroads,&quot; said Jai Ram Reddy, head of the opposition National Federation Party, which represents Fiji's large ethnic Indian population.</p>
<p>&quot;Fiji must chose stability or instability, peace and harmony or social discontent,&quot; Reddy told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>An independent constitutional review released in September called for an end to indigenous political supremacy, proposing a new 70-seat parliament with 45 non-ethnic seats.</p>
<p>When the review was presented to the parliament Rabuka welcomed it with calls for consensus.</p>
<p>But earlier this month, when the constitutional parliamentary committee held its first meeting, Rabuka stressed indigenous rights must remain a priority, quoting from a United Nations declaration on indigenous rights.</p>
<p>&quot;We must, throughout, keep our focus on the realities of Fiji,&quot; Rabuka said. &quot;Not everyone gets what everyone desires in this type of exercise,&quot; Rabuka warned.</p>
<p>Such remarks create anxiety in Fiji's Indian community which makes up about 46 percent of the 750,000 population.</p>
<p>Indians were brought to Fiji at the turn of the century to work the sugar cane plantations. Descendants of those labourers now dominate the sugar industry, Fiji's economic backbone, and hold many senior posts in business, the professions and the civil service.</p>
<p>But those who know Rabuka say these contradictory public statements are not to be taken as government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;One of his traits is his inconsistencies,&quot; said Samisoni Kakaivalu, editor of the Fiji Times newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;He says something today and the next day he contradicts himself. Every now and then he makes these utterances and it brings back suspicions and distrust,&quot; says Kakaivalu.</p>
<p>But whatever Rabuka's true position is on the constitution, one thing is sure -- he faces opposition to change.</p>
<p>Sakeasi Butadroka, leader of the radical but unelected Fijian Nationalist Party, supports the present constitution, arguing it is needed to help indigenous Fijians develop.</p>
<p>&quot;Indians and Asians have civilised blood in them because when they were civilised, we were still cannibals. We need to be left alone to compete among ourselves,&quot; says Butabroka, adding that those who disagree with his views should leave the country.</p>
<p>Reddy, a third-generation Indian Fijian, said he feels &quot;deeply hurt&quot; when people say Fiji is not his country.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know any other country. This is my home,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Views similar to Butadroka's aren't widely supported, even among native Fijians. The radical grassroots nationalist movement Taukei, which backed Rabuka in 1987 when he toppled an Indian-dominated government, has the support of only about five percent of native Fijians, Kakaivalu estimates.</p>
<p>But Kakaivalu, Reddy and business leaders say opposition to a balanced constitution is also coming from within the government.</p>
<p>The uncertainty over Fiji's political future has dampened the economy, say business leaders. Although the government is forecasting around four percent growth in the 1996 calendar year, this is inflated by new gold mining activity and good sugar returns.</p>
<p>The economy is probably growing at around two percent, and many small businesses are struggling to survive as consumer spending dries up and investment plans are put on hold, business leaders say.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fiji Times can feel it. Advertising and classifieds are down and newspaper sales are down,&quot; says Kakaivalu.</p>
<p>Rabuka and his government face another dilemma over the issue of native land leased to predominantly Indian sugar farmers. The farms' 30-year leases start to expire early next year and Rabuka has yet to announce new land-lease laws.</p>
<p>Reddy says without a fairer constitution Fiji's economy will worsen, resulting in social unrest.</p>
<p>He also warns of another exodus of Indian Fijians, historically Fiji's main source of domestic investment. Between 70,000 and 80,000 have already left since the 1987 coup.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Rabuka) doesn't want a constitution that will force most of the Indian investors out of this country,&quot; says Kakaivalu. &quot;That will be the end of Fiji.&quot;</p>
