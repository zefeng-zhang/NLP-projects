<p>Wolseley Plc, the UK building giant which reported better than expected profits of 242.9 million stg on Tuesday, said it did not expect any improvement in poor continental European markets in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Stephen Webster, chief financial controller, told Reuters &quot;I do not see an upturn in the next 12 months in France, Austria or Germany.&quot; He denied it would seriously dampen profits this coming year, explaining that conditions would remain level.  </p>
<p>The UK market is on the mend, with spending on the repair and maintenance of homes moving ahead and the house market picking up.</p>
<p>But Webster said the housebuilding sector had seen companies using up existing stock so there had been little feed-through so far to companies like Wolseley. He predicted it would be spring before the industry felt the benefits.</p>
<p>He also expressed concern about the threat of an interest rate rise in the group's biggest market, the U.S., which accounts for around 50 percent of sales. &quot;A half percent would not be a big deal but one percent could damage confidence.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;In the U.S. you only need one or two things to capsize confidence,&quot; said Webster, pointing to rates and political developments as possible threats</p>
<p>On acquisition and expansion plans, the group is continuing to seek bolt-on deals in markets like Germany, and Eastern Europe in the nearer term and the Far East further down the line.</p>
<p>Webster added that Wolseley had a very low level of gearing at 7.7 percent in case it needed to borrow for a big acquisition opportunity. When asked how high Wolseley could take it, he said: &quot;We see no problem with gearing going up to 20-30 percent.&quot;  </p>
<p>But the key underlying issue which analysts and investors will be examaining is whether the recent changeover in top management, which made John Young chief executive, results in changes to Wolseley's much-admired strategy.</p>
<p>Wolseley has weathered difficult market conditions better than other sector players, with some rivals seeing their profits collapse.</p>
<p>Webster admitted continuity was a key issue. &quot;We want to keep our track recrod he said.&quot;</p>
<p>But he hinted on some changes, adding: &quot;We are keen to keep the good things. If anything it may mean a change of style.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;But there are no sacred cows in Wolseley. We will take difficult decisions if needed.&quot;</p>
