<p>Global communications giant News Corp. Ltd. and long-distance provider MCI Communications Corp. are looking at possible new investors in their $129 million satellite broadcast centre to be built in Arizona, company executives said Tuesday.</p>
<p>At a ground-breaking ceremony, the top executives of both companies said the issue of attracting other investors to the project was actively being considered.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been approached by many people who would like to join us and we'll certainly give them consideration,&quot; said Rupert Murdoch, News Corp. chairman.</p>
<p>Murdoch did not identify the possible investors to reporters, adding that that no decision had been made.</p>
<p>Bert Roberts, MCI chairman, said he would encourage others to join the venture.</p>
<p>Currently, the two companies are partners in the American Sky Broadcast facility, which is expected to open in a small town east of Phoenix in November 1997.</p>
<p>The 100,000-square-foot facility will act as the nerve centre for satellite feeds from around the world, providing subscribers with 300 channels of entertainment news and information. Officials also have said that it could be the future home of a 24-hour news network.</p>
<p>Additionally, the 100-employee centre will offer a range of multi-media services to businesses and consumers.</p>
