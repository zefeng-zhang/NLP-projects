<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., citing gains in its tobacco and food businesses, Monday reported a 17 percent jump in profits for the latest quarter and predicted continued strong results.</p>
<p>The company said it earned $216 million, or 66 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $185 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period, when its results were reduced by hefty payments for early retirement of debt and preferred dividends.</p>
<p>Revenues rose 7 percent to $4.3 billion from $4.1 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Our latest quarterly results were ahead of expectations, representing strong performances from all three of our major business units and placing RJR Nabisco in the top-tier of consumer products for the period,&quot; Chairman Steven Goldstone said in a statement accompanying the results.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales and profits were up in domestic tobacco, international tobacco regained volume momentum and Nabisco's core domestic cookie and cracker business showed renewed strength,&quot; Goldstone said.</p>
<p>The latest results were reduced by $8 million in restructuring charges and $9 million in preferred dividends. Earnings in the year-ago quarter were reduced by $16 million for early debt repayment and $31 million in preferred dividends.</p>
<p>The New York-based company said its worldwide tobacco sales rose 5 percent to $2.11 billion, while cigarette volume gained 4 percent.</p>
<p>International tobacco sales grew 7 percent to $920 million, with volume growth of 9 percent. Volume gained more than 60 percent in central Europe and doubled in Romania and Turkey, while the company recorded strong sales of its new Camel Lights in western Europe, with Winston volumes up 25 percent worldwide.</p>
<p>Despite continued anti-tobacco attacks by both state and local officials and a slight drop in volume, the company's U.S. sales rose 3 percent to $1.19 billion during the quarter, contributing $375 million to its operating results. RJR said both its Camel and Doral brands posted volume gains.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking forward to a very strong fourth quarter and will enter 1997 with considerable momentum,&quot; Goldstone said. &quot;We believe the trends continue to be most promising for next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company's Nabisco Holdings Corp. foods unit, of which it owns 80.5 percent, said its third-quarter profits rose 35 percent, to $70 million, or 26 cents a share, from $52 million, or 20 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Sales rose 10 percent to $2.24 billion from $2.04 billion.</p>
<p>For the nine months, RJR earned $372 million, or $1.13 a share, on revenues of $12.4 billion. In the year-ago period, it earned $477 million, or $1.45 a share, on $11.7 billion in sales.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco's stock fell was unchanged at $26.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
