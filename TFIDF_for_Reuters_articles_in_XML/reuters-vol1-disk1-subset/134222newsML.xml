<p>Pakistani Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar said on Tuesday he hoped his efforts to broker a ceasefire between Afghan factions would bear fruit soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I am more than hopeful (for a ceasefire accord) because in principle they have all agreed,&quot; Babar, who has been shuttling between opposing faction leaders, told a news conference. &quot;The ceasefire will be applicable all across Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he was expecting a &quot;positive&quot; response from Uzbek militia chief Abdul Rashid Dostum from the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif &quot;today or tomorrow&quot;.</p>
<p>Babar said the draft agreement envisaged a ceasefire between the radical Islamic Taleban movement now ruling Kabul and forces loyal to ousted government military commander Ahmed Shah Masood.</p>
<p>The two sides were still trading fire on a plain north of Kabul on Tuesday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Babar said the proposed ceasefire agreement provided for an exchange of prisoners and bodies, as well as formation of a 12-member commission representing the Taleban and its opponents -- Dostum, Masood and Shi'ite Moslem leader Karim Khalili.</p>
<p>He said the agreement should be under United Nations auspices to carry more weight, adding that the Pakistani Foreign Ministry had briefed U.N. officials on his mission.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel we cannot do it alone,&quot; Babar said. &quot;We feel the United Nations has to be there.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. Special Envoy Norbert Holl, conducting separate efforts to arrange a ceasefire, said on Monday that no single country -- an apparent reference to Pakistan -- could bring peace to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The main obstacle to a ceasefire agreement at the moment appears to be a demand by Masood that talks on demilitarising Kabul should start as soon as the truce is in place.</p>
<p>Babar described this as an &quot;unfair condition&quot; that went beyond the terms of the proposed ceasefire accord.</p>
<p>&quot;We said that when the commission sits, this can be discussed,&quot; he added.</p>
