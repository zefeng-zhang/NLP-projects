<p>Zambia's former president and now main opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda said on Wednesday his party would boycott general elections called for November 18 by President Frederick Chiluba.</p>
<p>Controversial constitutional changes passed this year by a parliament dominated by Chiluba supporters block Kaunda from running for president although his United National Independence Party, UNIP, is free to take part.  </p>
<p>Zambia's Kaunda to boycott November election</p>
<p>Kaunda, president for three decades until Chiluba ousted him in Zambia's first free elections in 1991, told a news conference neither he nor his party would take part.</p>
<p>&quot;After a thorough examination of the state of our nation and events leading up to the election, UNIP has decided deliberately and consciously that we will not participate in the elections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He urged Zambian voters to boycott the poll, which is not being held until three weeks after the five-year mandate of Chiluba's government expires, and said UNIP would stage protest rallies even if the police banned them.</p>
<p>Foreign aid donors have threatened to block fresh aid to Zambia unless Chiluba overturns what they say are unfair constitutional amendments that prevent Kaunda challenging him.</p>
