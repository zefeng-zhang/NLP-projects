<p>Japan's controversial opposition leader Ichiro Ozawa gambled big -- and lost big -- when he bet voters would set aside distaste for his backroom fixer image and give him a shot at the nation's top post.</p>
<p>The humiliating setback for his Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) raises doubts about the future of Ozawa, once seen as a key candidate for prime minister, and about prospects for a viable two-party system, political pundits said on Monday.</p>
<p>Shinshinto -- born of a broad coalition that ended the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) monopoly on power in 1993 -- won only 156 seats in Sunday's general election, four fewer than it held before the vote.</p>
<p>The LDP secured 239 seats, 12 short of the majority it needed to rule alone but enough to ensure its president, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, would head Japan's next government.</p>
<p>On Monday, speculation mounted that Ozawa, whose penchant for high-handed tactics won as many enemies as his reformist vision won admirers, would be forced to resign as party chief or see his organisation split.</p>
<p>Either way, analysts and Japanese media said, Shinshinto looked set to see 10 or more members defect.</p>
<p>&quot;We were unable to win full support and we have to look into what made our presentation not that effective,&quot; Shinshinto Lower House member Isamu Ueda told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some analysts said Ozawa, 54, was all but certain to step down from the top party post. &quot;In the code of Japanese politics, he has pretty much said that he had to go,&quot; said John Neuffer, political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute.</p>
<p>Others said that forecast might be premature.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the only way he will step down (as party leader) would be if he had a good plan for how he would step back up,&quot; quipped one former aide to a Shinshinto MP.</p>
<p>A longtime rival of Hashimoto who once pulled premiers' strings like a master puppeteer, he bolted from the LDP in 1993 to become key strategist for the coalition that robbed the LDP of sole power in 1993.</p>
<p>His attempt to spell out in some detail a vision that included reforms to spur policy debate and loosen the web of regulations that gives bureaucrats such arbitrary power won plaudits -- especially among American officials seeking reforms in Japan's economy.</p>
<p>Such views have now become standard fare from politicians of nearly every stripe, although some sceptics doubt how sincere many really are.</p>
<p>Shinshinto's reliance for key support on a lay Buddhist group, the Soka Gakkai, also turned away many voters, as did a series of strategic missteps stemming from Ozawa's autocratic style, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ozawa made two mistakes -- his tie-up with Soka Gakkai, which made it difficult to get majority support, and his attempt to monopolise power within the party,&quot; said political commentator Minoru Morita.</p>
<p>Voters appeared unmoved by Ozawa's efforts to woo them ahead of the election with pledges to hold down the three percent sales tax while enacting hefty income tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a surprising error,&quot; said Roger Buckley, a professor at International Christian University in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it was a sign of desperation.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the fractured state of Japan's opposition, analysts said a viable second party could eventually emerge.</p>
<p>&quot;The silver lining for the opposition is the huge number of apathetic voters,&quot; Neuffer said, noting that some 40 percent of the electorate failed to vote at all. &quot;If the opposition can tap into the apathetic electorate, they could be a force to be reckoned with.&quot;</p>
