<headline>Chirac says he pressed Assad on Nazi criminal.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>French President Jacques Chirac said on Tuesday he had pressed Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to help track down and extradite to France the most notorious Nazi war criminal still at large.</p>
<p>&quot;I did indeed in my very first meeting with President Assad ask for the Nazi Alois Brunner, alias Georg Fischer, whom we have reason to believe is in Syria, to be tracked down,&quot; Chirac told a news conference in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;I told him that a French request for legal assistance had been sent to Syria. Mr Assad said he was not aware of this situation and he would immediately look into it,&quot; Chirac said.</p>
<p>The Simon Wiesenthal centre, specialised in Nazi-hunting, urged Chirac last Friday to raise the Brunner case with the Syrian authorities during his weekend visit to Damascus.</p>
<p>Brunner was World War Two deputy to fellow Austrian Adolf Eichmann, the man to whom Nazi leader Adolf Hitler entrusted the extermination of six million Jews.</p>
<p>He is alleged to have ordered the deportation of Jews from Austria, Greece, Czechoslovakia and France, where he was once head of the notorious Drancy transit camp.</p>
<p>Both French and German authorities have said in the past they believed he was hiding in Syria.</p>
<p>The Wiesenthal centre says Brunner is responsible for 143,000 deaths, including thousands of French citizens.</p>
