<headline>Unilever detergent ad sparks 'racist' charge.</headline>

<p>A TV commercial for Unilever's flagship Persil detergent showing a white horse escaping from a group of black horses has been accused by viewers of promoting racism, the industry watchdog said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC), which licenses and regulates Britain's commercial TV, said 32 viewers protested that the image implied that white is superior to black and &quot;therefore carried a racist message&quot;.</p>
<p>But the ITC said it was not banning the commercial as most viewers were unlikely to have found it offensive. However the watchdog urged careful vetting of advertisements using images which could be misconstrued as &quot;racial metaphors&quot;.</p>
<p>The Persil commercial, part of a Unilever campaign to show the cleaning powers of its newly-relaunched washing powder, also featured an ice skater dressed in white speeding away from his black-garbed companions, and a dalmatian dog shaking itself so that all its black spots flew off.</p>
<p>Unilever told the ITC it had created visual metaphors to support the soap powder's slogan 'To set clean free'.</p>
<p>Research on the likely acceptability of the commercial had included talks with Afro-Caribbean women, the company added.</p>
<p>The ad was created for Unilever by J Walter Thompson.</p>
<p>Complaints about another recent ad campaign were also based on the issue of race.</p>
<p>A poster for Benetton, the Italian retailer known for its controversial ads, showing a black horse mounting a white horse was scrapped last month because poster site owners said it was too shocking. A previous Benetton ad showed a black child looking like a little demon while a white child appeared as an angel.</p>
