<p>The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said on Monday that it had cut its estimated 1996/97 pool price for all grades of wheat except Durum by A$5.00 a tonne.  </p>
<p>The cut brings the the estimated return for the benchmark Australian Standard White (ASW) to A$190.00 a tonne FOB (gross).</p>
<p>The estimated return for Durum pools remains unchanged at A$225.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>AWB general manager merchandising Ron Storey said Australia was facing up to marketing its second largest wheat crop ever.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a million tonnes added to the estimated size of the crop in the last month and the bigger the crop grows the more we will fight with competitors to hold our market share or face increased carryover costs,&quot; he said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Australia marketed as much of its crop as possible in the first half of its selling year to take advantage of its off-season status compared with the rest of the world, he said.</p>
<p>This year Argentina was a stiff competitor at the peak of Australia's selling season. Australia also faced the prospect of a more protracted selling season in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>Australia could ship about 1.75 million tonnes of wheat a month and every additional tonne of wheat added to the crop now was a tonne which would have to be sold later in the year in competition with the northern hemisphere new crop, he said.  </p>
<p>Storey said signs were emerging that buyers were prepared to do business at present prices. The A$5.00 a tonne pools price cut compares with traders' predictions of a cut of between A$5.00 and A$15.00 a tonne on Friday and earlier Monday. Most believed the cut would be about A$10.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Rumours had been sweeping the wheat market, however, that the AWB had decided to hold pools prices steady, against market trends, to head off further grower criticism and in the hope of rising market prices early next year.</p>
<p>The next estimate of AWB pool returns will be November 11.</p>
