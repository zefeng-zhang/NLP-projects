<p>A Canadian cargo consortium plans to meet with freight firms next week to try to entice them to use this city's airport as an intercontinental shipping hub, the consortium's president told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There are 20 or 25 freight forwarders in the world that are big players, all companies that do US$1 billion a year. That's our target. We'll be meeting with them starting next week in North America, then in Asia and Europe later in October to obtain letters of commitment,&quot;  Winnport Logistics Ltd president Lynn Bishop said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>The consortium expects to fly twice weekly to the United Kingdom and Germany, with one extension to Bombay, India each week, as well as two weekly flights to South Korea and three weekly flights to Japan, Bishop said.</p>
<p>The firm had been in talks with Air Canada to lease two 747-100 cargo freighters, but is now in negotiations with an undisclosed airline for a similar arrangement and a deal is expected in the coming weeks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we want to do is offer a very attractive rate to freight forwarders and they'd be given guaranteed positions on the airplanes under a longer term contract,&quot; Bishop said.  </p>
<p>The consortium is promoting Winnipeg, located near the geographical center of North America with 18,000 acres of undeveloped land bordering the airport, as advantages to developing an air, rail and truck shipping hub here.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at shipping goods that may not be too time sensitive and because of that they can seek a lower rate, which is what we propose to offer,&quot; Bishop said.</p>
<p>Goods would include consumer electronics, car parts, pharmaceuticals, textiles from India as well as chilled pork and beef for Asian markets, he said.</p>
<p>Winnport will meet with  Emery Worldwide, among others.  </p>
<p>Canada's federal government plans to upgrade its border crossing at Emerson, Manitoba, which leads south through Kansas City and Dallas to Monterrey, Mexico, and east to Minneapolis and Chicago.</p>
<p>Five hundred commercial trucks transit that single border crossing every day.</p>
<p>Canada Customs officials are already testing transponders that identify a truck's contents and the status of its operator directly to a computer.</p>
<p>Letters of commitment, a lease agreement on the 747s and operating licenses must be in place by mid-December, he said.</p>
<p>If everything was in order by then, the consortium expected to begin operating on May 1, 1997, he said.</p>
<p>Winnport Logistics includes Air Canada, Canadian National Railway Co, CP Rail System, Winnipeg International Airport, Kleysen Transport, Matrix Freight Services Ltd, Reimer Express World Corp, James Richardson &amp; Sons Ltd and Bank of Montreal.</p>
