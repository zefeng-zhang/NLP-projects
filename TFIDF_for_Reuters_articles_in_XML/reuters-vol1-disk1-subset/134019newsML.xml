<p>Trading states from around the globe on Tuesday hailed New Zealand, a highly protected economy just a decade ago, as a reform model for other countries in the 123-member World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>The salute to New Zealand's successful opening to the outside world emerged from two days of discussion at the WTO on a report by the Geneva-based body's analysts, said Ireland's ambassador Anne Anderson who chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The depth and radicalism of the reform process was positively assessed and was seen as offering useful lessons for the economies of other WTO members,&quot; she told reporters in a briefing on the discussions.</p>
<p>And other trade diplomats said the general consensus had been that New Zealand was almost beyond reproach as a trading partner. &quot;They are really top of the class as open traders,&quot; commented one</p>
<p>Wade Armstrong, New Zealand's ambassador to the WTO who headed the Wellington delegation to the discussions on the report, told Reuters he regarded the two-days of discussion as &quot;very positive&quot;.</p>
<p>The report itself saluted the reforms, launched in the mid-1980s in an almost total break with a tradition of protectionist-style and regulatory policies, as a model that showed the value of an open economy.</p>
<p>WTO analysts who compiled the report said the switch had brought New Zealand, ranked global number three for competitiveness by an authoritative Swiss study earlier this year, into a period of sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;In an effort to break from a history of poor economic performance, New Zealand has transformed its economy from among the most heavily protected and regulated to one of the most market-oriented and open in the world,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand now provides a clear, positive example of liberalisation,&quot; the WTO analysts declared.</p>
<p>&quot;Its persistence in carrying through bold reforms in virtually every aspect of its economy has begun to pay substantial dividends, with an increase in the economy's sustainable growth potential.</p>
<p>The report is part of a series started during the late 1980s under the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, subjecting the trade policies of all member countries to regular review by its Secretariat and other trading states.</p>
<p>As well as opening up on the trade and investment fronts, it said, successive New Zealand governments had reformed virtually every part of the economy through privatisation and deregulation in the labour market and other domestic areas.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade liberalisation has been undertaken primarily on the unilateral track, in the recognition that liberal trade policies are in New Zealand's best interest, whatever the policies of other countries,&quot; the WTO analysts said.</p>
<p>In a report of its own for the review, New Zealand said that as a country with a population of little more than 3,5 million international trade was vital to its prosperity.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall goal of New Zealand's trade policy is strightforward: to achieve sustainable economic growth through trade.&quot;  This objective was directed at complete multilateral free trade, the government report said.</p>
<p>In two low-key notes of criticism, echoed during the discussion, the WTO survey said tariffs for textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles remained relatively high, lagging behind radical cuts on other products.</p>
<p>The report also suggested New Zealand should move to abolish its system of agricultural export licensing controls -- which the analysts said amounted in some cases to export monopolies -- which are operated through marketing boards.</p>
