<p>European financial markets showed a sanguine reaction to news of a second U.S. attack on Iraq on Wednesday, marking stocks higher, the dollar steady and gold lower.</p>
<p>Wall Street whipsawed on Tuesday, falling sharply at the open on the Iraq raid news, but snapping back to 30 points ahead by the close, largely as higher oil prices pumped up petroleum stocks and the U.S. interest rate outlook remained inconclusive.</p>
<p>British shares opened higher on Wednesday, reversing the bulk of Tuesday's losses after the rebound in U.S. stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>An agreed 264 million pound ($412.1 million) bid by food distributor Booker for food wholesaler Nurdin &amp; Peacock also helped sentiment, sending the FTSE 100 index up 23 points with gaining stocks outweighing decliners by some eight to one.</p>
<p>Yet traders said markets were likely to be quiet ahead of Wednesday's monetary meeting between Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George and finance minister Kenneth Clarke.</p>
<p>German shares started bourse trade sharply higher, in a rebound after Tuesday's falls on concern about the Iraq raids.</p>
<p>Dealers said concern about tensions in the region had receded, but they bemoaned a lack of strong buying interest.</p>
<p>They saw steady trade, with the focus on the crucial U.S. non-farm payrolls for August due on Friday.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank rebounded as concern ebbed over funds suspended at its London unit Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Lufthansa was higher after heavy pressure on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Paris, French stocks also opened higher, helped by firmer bond prices and Wall Street's strong close.</p>
<p>Oil stocks Total and Elf-Aquitaine, which have risen on the back of higher oil prices, extended their gains after Total confirmed investor expectations of good results by reporting a 45 percent jump in its first-half profit.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index was up around 11 points, but still below the 2,000 level.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar was steady in early European trade, shrugging off the second U.S. attack on Iraq and holding firm above 1.48 marks and 109 yen.</p>
<p>Although off overnight levels and Tuesday's spike above 1.49 marks, dealers said there was still buying interest near the low 1.48 marks area and around 109 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/mark is slap bang in the middle of the ranges we've seen over the last two-and-a-half months and there is no reason why we should break out of that today,&quot; said a U.S. bank dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraq thing will only have an impact on the forex market if it drags on and then it will hurt the yen and maybe the mark.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said a prolonged U.S. campaign against Iraq could keep oil prices high and therefore pressure the yen because of Japan's high dependence on dollar-priced oil imports.</p>
<p>&quot;It really depends on how long it lasts. If it's short-lived than it is not crucial,&quot; said Roger Francis, senior analyst at IBJ International. &quot;If it goes on for a month or more than we'll start to feel problems eventually. But this is seen as a very short-term thing, most of it is a panic reaction so far.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold ignored the U.S. raid, trading lower in early trade at $386.50 an ounce against $386.95 at the London close.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.4836 marks and 108.85 yen after 1.4837 marks and 109.25 yen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 26.5 points at 3,882.4.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was 21.10 up at 2,531.87.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 10.74 at 1,982.17.</p>
