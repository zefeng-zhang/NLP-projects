<p>Australian Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp said on Monday the government expected strong economic growth to continue in 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect solid growth to continue this year and are forecasting real GDP (gross domestic product) growth of around 3.5 percent,&quot; Kemp told a Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia conference.</p>
<p>The forecast is line with the government's 1996/97 budget prediction.</p>
<p>Kemp also said Australia's current account deficit remained a problem.</p>
<p>&quot;It is wrong to conclude that the current account problem is over,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Kemp said the main challenges facing the government were to boost national savings and reduce the current account deficit, which stood at A$1.330 billion, seasonally adjusted, in August.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been argued by some that the recent decline in the current account deficit - which has been significant - means that it is under control,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;While this statement is true, it is wrong to conclude that the current account deficit problem is over.&quot;</p>
<p>He said improvement in the current account deficit during the past year was the result of cyclical, rather than structural factors and the fact that it had come off a high level.</p>
<p>Kemp said national savings were too low to keep the current account deficit at a comfortable level.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher national savings, which helps address the current account deficit and takes pressure off interest rates, can be expected to boost growth and employment over the medium term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kemp also said the government expected to meet its 8.25 percent unemployment rate target for 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is also expecting a fall in the unemployment rate, although this will be muted to some extent as people are encouraged to enter or re-enter the workforce,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hence, the unemployment rate is forecast to fall only modestly to around 8.25 percent by next June.&quot;</p>
<p>Employment growth was expected to strengthen through 1996/7 as a result of continued strong economic activity and expected moderation in real wage growth, he said.</p>
