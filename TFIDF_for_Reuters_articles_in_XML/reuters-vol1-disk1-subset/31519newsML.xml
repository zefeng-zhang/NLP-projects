<p>Burundi's civil war flared close to the capital on Wednesday with the Tutsi-dominated army using helicopter gunships and mortars to repel Hutu rebels.</p>
<p>An army spokesman said fighting broke out when the rebels attacked targets on Bujumbura's eastern outskirts after heavy exchanges of fire overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;Fighting started up (again) around three p.m. (1300 GMT) and it is fairly intensive,&quot; Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi told Reuters.</p>
<p>Residents said they saw helicopters take to the skies to hit rebel positions and heard mortars used in the latest battle around Tshiangano, a few kilometres (miles) from the city.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent saw smoke rising from the steep hills east of Bujumbura.</p>
<p>Majority Hutu rebels of the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) stepped up their guerrilla campaign after the mainly Tutsi army seized power on July 25.</p>
<p>Regional leaders imposed tough economic and transport sanctions six days after Major Pierre Buyoya took over, severing air and road links and stopping fuel supplies.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme (WFP) said it was looking after 16,000 people, mainly Tutsis, displaced by fighting in the last five days in the northern Kayanza province.</p>
<p>A giant U.S. air force C-141 Starlifter was stuck for several hours at Bujumbura airport on Wednesday after Tanzania refused to allow it to overfly on the grounds this would be sanctions-busting, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The transport plane finally left for Kenya with 31 American and other expatriates aboard after Rwanda and Uganda gave it permission to use their air space en route to Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an evacuation. It is a routine embassy support flight,&quot; U.S. embassy spokesman Louis Segesvary said in Nairobi.</p>
<p>&quot;My aid operation has been closed down, so I am being pulled back to Europe. There isn't much for me to do here now,&quot; said a Belgian aid worker as he waited to board the American plane.</p>
<p>As the fighting intensified, exiled leaders of Burundi's mainstream Hutu party, Frodebu, announced they were backing the FDD and called on the party's chairman, Jean Minani, to make an official announcement to that effect.</p>
<p>The FDD and its political wing, the CNDD, are led by former interior minister and Frodebu stalwart Leonard Nyangoma.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Frodebu's support among ordinary Hutus -- 85 percent of Burundi's six million people -- eroded after Buyoya's coup and Nyangoma was seen as the only credible leader to take on the Tutsi army.</p>
<p>Ousted President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, also from Frodebu, remains holed up in the U.S. ambassador's residence in Bujumbura where he took refuge on the eve of the coup.</p>
<p>Julius Nyerere, the international mediator on Burundi, said the Frodebu-CNDD alliance was probably positive since it &quot;clarified&quot; the Hutu leadership.</p>
<p>Nyerere, Tanzania's former president, has tried in vain to get all parties to start peace talks. Buyoya and the army want the rebels to renounce violence first and Nyangoma says the army's return to barracks is a pre-condition.</p>
<p>&quot;Either side would be making a terrible mistake to try and solve the Burundi problem militarily. What does winning mean in a civil war? Who will decorate you for killing your own people?&quot; Nyerere told a Nairobi news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe both the army and the armed groups should now say 'we have killed enough people, let's sit down and talk,'&quot; he added.</p>
