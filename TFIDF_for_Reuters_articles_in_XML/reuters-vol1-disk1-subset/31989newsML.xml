<p>Two successive hikes in overnight rates by the Philippine Central Bank are temporary measures to contain volatility in the foreign exchange market and interest rates will continue to fall overall, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) raised rates in two successive tranches this week taking the overnight lending rate to 14.5 percent from 12.75.</p>
<p>It raised its overnight borrowing rate to 12.5 percent from 10.25 percent.</p>
<p>The raising of overnight rates had the desired effect with the peso strenghtening to an average of 26.234 on Wednesday from 26.265 on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It has now become expesive to sell pesos and buy dollars. Carrying cost has gone up to 3.2 points from 2.1,&quot; Standard Chartered Bank (Philippines) treasurer Steven Gakhar said.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely, it's a temporary control measure,&quot; Gakhar said of the rate increases and predicted they would fall back soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are generally downwards and this blip might last for a week or two,&quot; said Jim Yap, a trader at Multinational Investment Bancorporation, a securities dealer.</p>
<p>The overnight rate increases on Tuesday and Wednesday came at a time when the market was expecting interest rates to fall in line with Treasury bill rates and an expected continuing decline in inflation.</p>
<p>At the latest auction of government securities on Monday, the average yield on the 91-day bill fell to 11.57 percent from 12.029. The previous auction had seen the yield fall to 12.029 from 12.074 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the Central Bank's move to raise rates must have been influenced by the peso's relatively sharp fall on Monday when it fell to 26.265.</p>
<p>The peso might have fallen even lower that day but the Central Bank intervened by buying $100 million out of $283.7 million traded. Normal daily trading volumes are around $100 million.</p>
<p>Explanations for the peso's fall ranged from a chain reaction started by a large commercial order (for dollars) to a supply of extra pesos in the market after investors cut back on buying reverse repos.</p>
<p>The lack of appetite for reverse repos was attributed to a new rule introduced on Monday under which buyers must allow the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to inspect these deals.</p>
<p>The Philippines' bank secrecy law gives banks the right not to reveal any of their transactions and the BIR had complained that it lost taxes on reverse repo deals.</p>
