<p>Real Madrid clawed their way back to the top of the Spanish first division on Tuesday thanks to two goals from Croatian striker Davor Suker in a controversial 2-1 win at Zaragoza.</p>
<p>With 21 points from nine games, Real go one point ahead of arch-rivals Barcelona, who play at Sevilla on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The result further endangers the position of Zaragoza coach Victor Fernandez, who just 16 months ago took his side to the European Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
<p>The game turned on a penalty decision 10 minutes from time when Real striker Predrag Mijatovic fell in the Zaragoza area after a challenge from Xavier Aguado.</p>
<p>The referee, who sent off Zaragoza's Vladislav Radimov moments later, incensed home fans still smarting from a hotly-disputed penalty decision which they believe cost them the game against Barcelona earlier this season.</p>
<p>Real had started strongly, and went ahead just after the quarter-hour when Suker knocked home a rebound from a shot by Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf.</p>
<p>But Zaragoza struck back, only to see Real's Bodo Illgner deflect a shot from  Francisco Higuera onto the post after 37 minutes, while Gustavo Poyet beat the German 'keeper with a header that bounced off the bar on the stroke of halftime.</p>
<p>Poyet knocked in a cross from Higuera to grab a well-deserved equaliser just after the break, and for a time it looked as if Zaragoza would take control.</p>
<p>But then the referee ordered the penalty for the challenge on Mijatovic, who has been frequently accused of taking dives in the area this season.</p>
<p>Real had no problems hanging on to the lead after the decision to send off Radimov, in a curious incident in which the Russian appeared to kick the ball at the referee.</p>
