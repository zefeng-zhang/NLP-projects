<p>-- DEUTSCHE TELEKOM SHARES MAY COST DM30</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned telecommunications company which is being partially privatised, is due to announce a price range for the shares today. The issue will be Europe's largest-ever initial public offering. Deutsche is expected to announce prices between 25 and 30 marks, at the high end of independent estimates, implying a valuation of the company at between 65 billion and 78 billion marks.</p>
<p>-- CABINET SHELVES TWO BILLS DEALING WITH BUSINESS LAW</p>
<p>The British government has dropped two business-related bills from the legislative programme for the final session of this Parliament. The bills, one dealing with reform of building societies and one on UK competition law, had already been the subject of extensive consultation with the private sector, and the news was greeted with disappointment by the industries concerned. The government is to concentrate on crime, education and benefit fraud in the forthcoming session as it gears up politically for the next general election.</p>
<p>-- RETAILERS SEE BETTER CHRISTMAS</p>
<p>A survey by the business information group Dun and Bradstreet found that 60 percent of Britain's retailers say they are expecting an increase in new orders in the run-up to Christmas. Retail sales showed an unexpected one percent increase in August, and figures due out later this week may confirm the return to confidence among consumers.</p>
<p>-- PULL DOWN BARRIERS, SAY EU COUNTRIES</p>
<p>The European Commission, which this year is conducting an exercise to assess the economic impact of the single market, has conducted two major surveys of businesses covering over 13,500 companies. The results show widespread satisfaction about the benefits of the EU's barrier-free bloc, but a desire to see the movement to a single market completed. The companies called for more radical energy liberalization, harmonization of VAT and action to break open the market for public procurement.</p>
<p>-- EUROTUNNEL TO CUT OVER 650 JOBS</p>
<p>Eurotunnel is expected to announce several hundred job cuts on Monday, as the Channel tunnel rail-link operator attempts to cut costs and move towards profitability. The Anglo-French company spoke with unions last week about the plans, believed to involve about 657 jobs out of a total of 3,500 employees. The staff will be shed over the next 14 months.</p>
<p>-- MANUFACTURING PAY AWARDS 'STILL FALLING'</p>
<p>Two sets of statistics to be published Monday will reveal that the size of pay awards in manufacturing industry is continuing to fall, and that the gap between the pay for managers and employees is widening. A survey by the Confederation of British Industry found an average rise in provisional pay awards of 3.2 percent in manufacturing for the three months to September this year. A survey of executive pay by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes found a 5.1 percent rise in median base salary increases for UK managers last year.</p>
<p>-- FOOTBALL BOOSTS SPORTS MARKET</p>
<p>A report to be published Monday by the retail consultancy Corporate Intelligence on Retailing will reveal that the sports market grew by about 150 million pounds to 2.9 billion pounds between 1994 and 1995. The upward trend is expected to continue following the popularity of the Euro 96 football event in Britain this summer, the fashion for sports apparel, and the higher profile accorded to soccer and the newly-professionalised rugby union.</p>
<p>-- EMAP DIRECTOR CALLS FOR NEW BOARD PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Professor Ken Simmonds, professor of marketing and international business at London Business School and a non- executive director of the media group Emap, has called for new boardroom procedures governing the removal of directors from the board. The call, directed at other UK companies as well as Emap, follows a dispute at the Emap AGM during the summer over the introduction of new rules which have made it easier for directors to be dismissed.</p>
<p>-- DEUTSCHE BANK CLAIMS YOUNG GAINED ON DEALS</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank, the German parent of Morgan Grenfell whose Morgan Grenfell Asset Management division was recently involved in a scandal over unit trusts managed by Peter Young, has formally acknowledged for the first time that Young had been diverting funds 'for his own benefit'. The admission is contained in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission made last week, in which the German bank gave details of its investigation into the affair.</p>
<p>-- BP/MOBIL TO CONTRACT OUT FINANCE OPERATIONS</p>
<p>Oil giants BP and Mobil are to contract out many of the finance operations of their planned European joint venture in refining and marketing. The groups have been holding talks with employee works councils in countries across Europe over the plan to transfer about 730 staff to international accounting companies. These staff will keep track of the estimated $20 billion worth of annual sales generated by the new alliance.</p>
