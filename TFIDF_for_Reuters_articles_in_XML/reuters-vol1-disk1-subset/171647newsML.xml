<title>CANADA: Loewen returns to strong growth in third quarter.</title>
<headline>Loewen returns to strong growth in third quarter.</headline>

<p>Funeral home operator the Loewen Group Inc. announced a sharp jump in third-quarter earnings Thursday although costs for fighting a hostile $2.9 billion takeover bid from rival Service Corp. International pared the increase.</p>
<p>Loewen hailed the results, saying they were the first time it had returned to its historical earnings per share growth rate of at least 25 percent since a lawsuit in Mississippi nearly forced it to declare bankruptcy earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a real celebration day for the Loewen Group. It's the first quarter we can begin to think of leaving the pain of Mississippi (lawsuit) truly, truly behind us,&quot; Chairman Ray Loewen said.</p>
<p>Total net earnings rose to $14.5 million in the third quarter from $10.1 million a year earlier, while revenues grew to $130.8 million from $106.3 million.</p>
<p>Earnings per share before unusual costs rose to 29 cents from 23 cents a year earlier. After costs tied to the takeover battle this year and costs for fighting the lawsuit last year, fully diluted earnings were 25 cents, up from 20 cents.</p>
<p>Loewen said costs related to the Service bid were $2.6 million. Because the Service bid was only announced in mid-September, most of the amount was a provision for expenses anticipated at the end of the quarter but not yet incurred. Those costs would include fees for lawyers and bankers.</p>
<p>Loewen has urged shareholders to reject the $2.9 billion bid from Houston-based Service, North America's biggest funeral home and cemetery operator.</p>
<p>Showing no sign of slowing its own acquisition campaign, Loewen said it signed deals to buy independent funeral homes and cemeteries totalling $1.3 billion so far this year, a record.</p>
<p>Ray Loewen said this showed Loewen's strong &quot;political positioning&quot; in the industry and was a sign of support for its effort to remain independent. &quot;Every dollar of acquisitions we think of as a vote,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Loewen stock slipped after the earnings announcement, dropping 25 cents to $39.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts on average had forecast third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share, estimate service IBES reported earlier this week, although Loewen said the average was later reduced to 29 cents.</p>
<p>Bid costs had been expected to trim that number by a cent or two but the 4 cents a share that Loewen reported appeared to exceed expectations. &quot;The earnings seemed mildly disappointing, a little light,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Loewen's earnings growth slipped after it faced a $500 million damage award in a breach of contract lawsuit in Mississippi last year. It later settled that case and another lawsuit which together reduced its 1995 fourth-quarter earnings by $165 million.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Paul Wagler said Loewen was comfortable with analysts' earnings per share forecasts for the fourth quarter of 42 cents, excluding any more costs it might incur to fight the Service bid.</p>
<p>He was unable to forecast fourth-quarter costs for the takeover battle but said some expenses were likely.</p>
