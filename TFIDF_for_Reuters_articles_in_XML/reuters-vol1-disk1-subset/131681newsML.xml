<p>Spanish telecommunications group Telefonica could buy the state's 23.78 percent stake in Telefonica Internacional (TISA) before the group is privatised, TISA's managing director Marcial Portela said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The chairman of Telefonica has told the prime minister of his wish to buy this 24 percent providing the price is adequate,&quot; Portela told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;That the Spanish state has a stake in TISA, which is a company which invests in other countries, is not very logical and can even be negative because, for example, in Panama they are barring us from participating in privatisation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;For the Spanish state this means holding a stake which is not liquid. The state can't realise that investment or sell to anyone but Telefonica. It seems practical to us for the state to abandon the stake it has in TISA and for Telefonica to buy it,&quot; Portela said.</p>
<p>Although the Spanish government could technically sell its stake in TISA to another telecommunications group, this would take several months and would probably not allow it to complete the sale before the privatisation of Telefonica early next year.</p>
