<title>UK: Bulgaria firms in higher emerging debt market.</title>
<headline>Bulgaria firms in higher emerging debt market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>Emerging debt prices, including Bulgaria after Tuesday's plunge, firmed on Wednesday with a helpful shove by stronger U.S. Treasuries, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the market is performing very well...people in the long-term expect to see more Eurobonds and Philippine-style issues, which helps the market,&quot; one U.S. trader said. Russia's planned Eurobond, expected in November, should help lift the price for the country's close-to-rescheduled Vneshekonombank debt, traders said.</p>
<p>Argentina will also launch 700 million marks' worth of Eurobonds with maturities of up to 20 years.</p>
<p>And earlier this week, the Philippines announced plans to issue $2 billion in uncollateralised bonds to buy back some of its Brady debt.</p>
<p>The Philippines Finance Minister will be in London next week as part of the roadshow for the bond.</p>
<p>That Filipino issue follows a successful buyback earlier in the year by Mexico, and Brazil is talking about doing something similar.</p>
<p>Despite the latest rise, one analyst said the market was beginning to look top-heavy.</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably due for a correction. It's hard to justify some of the spreads we are seeing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria, which tumbled about seven percent this week, was about two cents up from Tuesday's low.</p>
<p>Though some traders saw the low as a buying opportunity for those prepared to take the risk in return for the highest yield in the market, analysts warned that the outlook for the Bulgarian economy remained fairly bleak.</p>
<p>This week's fall followed a delay by the International Monetary Fund in disbursing the latest tranche of a loan.</p>
<p>Most traders expected Bulgarian debt to continue to underperform the rest of the market at least in the short-term.</p>
<p>Among other paper, Russia, Mexico and Poland were all a touch firmer in a relatively subdued market, which is now hanging on to see if Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls figures for August point to higher U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The market seems to have ignored the rebellion that erupted in Mexico last week and focused more on the country's rosier economic prospects.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Standard and Poor's boosted its outlook for Mexican debt to stable from negative and said the country was on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>The latest crisis over Iraq has largely been ignored though traders said the resulting higher oil prices could rub off on to key oil producing debtors, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela.</p>
<p>But one trader said he has not yet seen any oil-linked buying in Bradys.</p>
