<p>Investors in Morgan Grenfell's three suspended European funds are waiting to see whether the overall valuations are cut but will be reassured by the company offering to cover any liabilities, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Morgan Grenfell on Monday suspended dealing in the funds -- the 788 million stg MG European Growth Trust, the 134 million stg MG Europa and the 445 million stg Dublin-listed MG European Capital Growth fund, pending investigation into &quot;possible irregularities centring on certain unquoted securities&quot;. (Corrects to show MG European Capital Dublin listed, not MG European Growth).</p>
<p>The funds have 70,000, 20,000 and 1,800 investors respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure Morgan Grenfell is working closely with the regulators -- it is in everyone's interests to solve this as quickly as possible,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF).</p>
<p>&quot;Morgan Grenfell's reputation is very high and they have said they will cover any liabilites. There is a big bank behind the fund management company.&quot; The UK's Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) has confirmed it is making enquiries with Morgan Grenfell but stressed the investigation was not yet official. Two of the funds, the Capital Growth and European Growth, are managed by Peter Young, who has been suspended but is helping with the investigation.</p>
<p>Investors' holdings will be frozen until the probe into the level of unquoted securities held is completed. No timescale has been given but the regulator would then either drop the enquiry or make it official, fund managers said. The suspension was significant because of Morgan Grenfell's high profile and blue-chip status. &quot;This was the fund that IFA's (independent financial advisors) recommended on the back of its excellent performance,&quot; said one. Investors concerns will centre on the overall valuation of the funds, which might have to be reviewed if their holdings are valued differently, leaving a shortfall between what investors thought their units were worth and what they are now worth.</p>
<p>According to an end-May portfolio breakdown of the MG European Growth Trust, some 28 percent of the fund was in unquoted securities, when a limit of 10 percent is more usual.</p>
<p>AUTIF noted that if managers &quot;inadvertantly&quot; exceed this limit, they have six months to correct it. Morgan Grenfell has said unquoted holdings now are closer to 10 percent.</p>
<p>If the funds are revalued downwards, Morgan Grenfell would have to pick up a tab estimated by one British newspaper as 150 million stg, on the basis that 10 percent of the three funds worth a total of 1.4 billion stg was in unquoted stocks.</p>
<p>Morgan Grenfell declined to comment. &quot;We cannot speculate what extent of these might be,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;But the main message for small shareholders is that all liabilites will be covered,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>AUTIF said they had not detected undue concern from retail investors but declined to comment on whether UK unit trust sales would be affected longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;The sector is tightly regulated. If it was the trustees who picked this up, it just shows they are doing their job,&quot; the spokeswoman said. The initial Morgan Grenfell statement said the decision to suspend dealing had been reached &quot;in conjunction with the trustees&quot;.</p>
<p>In the MG European Growth Trust end-May report, the trustees note that &quot;on the basis of the informaton available to us...the holdings by the trust in each of the undermentioned companies represented more than 10 percent of the relevant issued share capital, in breach of regulation 5.14 of the Financial Services (Regulated Schemes) Regulation 1991.&quot;</p>
