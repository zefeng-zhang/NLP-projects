<p>Italian rookie Alex Zanardi won his third consecutive IndyCar pole on Saturday at the Vancouver Grand Prix, jumping all the way from the 12th spot he had reached in the previous day's provisional qualifying.</p>
<p>Driving a Reynard Honda, Zanardi led a group of 12 drivers breaking the track record, set Friday, with a time of 53.980 seconds or 113.576 mph (182.778 kph) around the 10-turn, 1.703 mile (2.741 km) temporary road circuit at Concord Pacific Place.</p>
<p>Michael Andretti, the provisional polesitter, fell to second fastest with a time of 54.483 seconds in a Lola Ford Cosworth, followed by Bobby Rahal in a Reynard Mercedes-Benz at 54.578.</p>
<p>Zanardi has been blistering the tour recently, winning five poles and starting from the front row in the last seven races. He has jumped from 17th to third in the points standings with two races remaining.</p>
<p>Jimmy Vasser, the current points leader, qualified fifth in a Reynard Honda at 54.617 seconds, improving from 17th. Al Unser Jr, who stands second in the series, qualified seventh at 54.683 seconds in a Penske Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>After a less than perfect Friday Zanardi conferred with his engineer, Morris Nunn, to change the setup of his car before Saturday's unofficial practice. It didn't work. &quot;We made a lot of changes to the car this morning but the car was even worse than Friday,&quot; said Zanardi.</p>
<p>The Ganassi Racing team then gambled &quot;and put a completely different setup on the car for qualifying,&quot; Zanardi explained. &quot;It was a shot in the dark, really, but we knew it was in the right direction and we ended up with a very good car.&quot;</p>
<p>Twenty-seven drivers qualified for Sunday's 100-lap, 170.3 mile (274.1 km) race, the penultimate round of the 16-race series which ends on September 8 at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, California.</p>
