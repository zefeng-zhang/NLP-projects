<p>Oil refiners in Australia have agreed to extend their charter of a 96,000-tonne crude tanker, ending a week-long dispute at Mobil Oil Australia's Altona refinery here, union and Mobil sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The deal to charter the Canopus for another year was reached on Friday night and ended a strike aboard the tanker, which had been prevented by its crew from unloading at Mobil's 108,000 barrels-per-day refinery since late October 10, they said.</p>
<p>The ship, stranded with about 30,000 tonnes of griffin crude when the crew downed tools, completed unloading and sailed on Saturday for a Singapore dry dock, shipping sources said.  </p>
<p>The consortium of refiners chartering the tanker -- Mobil, British Petroleum Co Plc and Ampol Petroleum Pty Ltd -- had planned to stop using the Australian-crewed ship this month, but agreed to extend the charter after talks with the MUA.</p>
<p>&quot;That vessel will continue in its trade for 12 months to give the parties an opportunity to develop structural efficiencies through enterprise bargaining,&quot; MUA official Mick Doleman said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are more than happy to work to improve our competitive position in a rational way,&quot; he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The dispute aboard the Canopus did not affect production or supply to the Altona refinery, Mobil spokeswoman Samantha Potts said, confirming the ship had been carrying a total of 80,000 tonnes of crude, not 80,000 litres as previously cited by Mobil.</p>
<p>But the issue has highlighted a move by oil majors in Australia to increasingly use foreign-crewed tankers for their marine crude supplies, the union and Mobil representatives said.</p>
<p>Mobil had said before last Friday's agreement that the Canopus consortium no longer suited the company and that it wanted to charter more efficient foreign-crewed vessels instead.  </p>
<p>The Canopus and its sister tanker the Era, which is also chartered by oil refiners in Australia, have both been sold recently by Howard Smith Ltd for US$52.5 million.</p>
<p>The Canopus' new owner, Greek firm Liquimar, has yet to agree to a new charter but the agreement obliges the refiners to charter another Australian-crewed tanker if the Canopus is no longer available, the MUA and the shipping sources said.</p>
<p>Renegotiation for Era's charter is due early next year. The Era is chartered by BP, Mobil, Ampol and Royal Dutch/Shell.</p>
