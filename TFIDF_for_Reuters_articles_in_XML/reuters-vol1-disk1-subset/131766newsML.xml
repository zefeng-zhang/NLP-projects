<p>Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak said on Monday Bangladesh expects to solve a decades-old water sharing dispute with India by December -- the start of a six-month dry season.</p>
<p>&quot;I am optimistic about a long-term agreement on sharing the flow of the Ganges River by December. Negotiations are progressing well in that direction,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The election in June of Sheikh Hasina as Bangladesh's prime minister generated much goodwill in both countries, said Razzak, who leaves for New Delhi on October 28 for talks with his Indian counterpart.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the political will on both sides that will decide the fate of the water sharing problem. It's good that this time the government in New Delhi is willing for a solution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Razzak said Bangladesh and India had 54 rivers in common, but for now Dhaka wanted only a quick deal over sharing the flow of the Ganges.</p>
<p>The Ganges dispute has been a major irritant in relations between the two neighbours since India built its Farakka barrage near Bangladesh's northern bordfer in 1974, restricting the river's flow.</p>
<p>Dhaka says India diverts much of the water to meet its own requirements for irrigation and navigation during the dry season,  while it releases excess water during monsoon, causing extensive flooding in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue also has political implications,&quot; Razzak said, apparently referring to opposition warnings that failure to obtain sufficient water from the river might turn people against Hasina's government.</p>
<p>Razzak rejected the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party's claim that India wanted a land transit across Bangladesh as a payback for water sharing.</p>
<p>Jyoti Basu, chief minister of India's West Bengal state bordering Bangladesh, is expected to visit Dhaka around the middle of November for further talks on water sharing, Razzak said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basu's visit will be very significant since his CPM party is a major partner of the government in New Delhi,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dhaka says India's Farakka barrage 18 km (11 miles) from Bangladesh's northern border obstructs the river flow and deprives the country of its fair share of water.</p>
<p>Officials say more than 40 million people in northern and north-western Bangladesh faced gradual desertification of their land because of the Farakka barrage.</p>
<p>The minister declined to say how much water Bangladesh would be asking for.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a lot. They (India) also have their needs. We have to consider needs of both sides,&quot; Razzak said.</p>
<p>Under the last agreement, which expired in 1988, Bangladesh received 34,500 cusec (cubic metres per second) of Ganges water during the dry seasn. Attempts to renew the agreement failed.</p>
