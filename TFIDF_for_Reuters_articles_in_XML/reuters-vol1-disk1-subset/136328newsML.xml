<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger on Wednesday, but underperformed their U.S. counterparts amid a 30-year bond auction and some disappointment that the Bank of Canada did not cut interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a reasonably quiet day in the market. There was a little bit of disappointment early when the Bank chose not to go,&quot; said Mark Chandler, an economist with Goldman Sachs. &quot;The focus in the latter half of the day was the long bond auction.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.14 to C$110.95 to yield 7.079 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark rose 9/32 to yield 6.83 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the benchmark bonds widened to 25 basis points from an 11-year low of 23 basis points at the close of trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Many traders anticipated a rate cut this morning after the release of weak retail sales data on Monday and tame inflation data on Tuesday. While T-bills weakened after the bank failed to move, dealers said expectations of a cut were still helping support shorter term bonds.</p>
<p>New supply also weighed on longer term bonds. The Bank of Canada auctioned C$1.5 billion of Government of Canada bonds with a coupon 8.0 percent and maturing on June 1, 2027.  </p>
<p>The auction had an average yield of 7.179 percent and an average price of C$110.104. Traders said the auction was generally well received.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar also helped to provide support for bonds this afternoon, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The currency obviously performed very well today as well and was a contributing factor in our afternoon recovery,&quot; said Chandler.</p>
<p>Canada's dollar closed firmer at C$1.3536 (US$0.7443) from Tuesday's close of C$1.3452 (US$0.7434) in active trading, dealers said.  </p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada 7.0 percent of 2006 fell C$0.02 to C$104.15 to yield 6.433 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark rose 5/32 to yield 6.55 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the 10-year bonds narrowed to 12 basis points from 14 basis points at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 3.20 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.12 percent.</p>
