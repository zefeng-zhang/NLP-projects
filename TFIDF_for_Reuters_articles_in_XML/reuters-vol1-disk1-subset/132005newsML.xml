<p>Malaysia's national budget for calendar 1997, to be presented on Friday, is unlikely to have much impact on the local stock market although certain measures may benefit some sectors, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there will be much of an impact unless there are major surprises,&quot; said Soon Teck Onn, an analyst at Baring Research.</p>
<p>No such surprises are expected when Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim unveils the budget, which analysts predict will be less restrictive than the current year's.</p>
<p>Many expect a corporate tax cut of at least one percent to keep Malaysia competitive with its neighbours.</p>
<p>Mahathir said on Monday the budget would include measures to encourage growth, including incentives for high-tech industries, particularly information technology. Last week he said cuts in import tariffs were likely.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget will be highly predictable,&quot; said David Yong, research head at Capitalcorp Securities. &quot;Though likely to be positive for the market, I don't foresee much impact.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts said they expect further restrictions on credit and measures to encourage savings in an overheated economy that is only now showing the first signs of a pause after more than eight years of eight percent annual growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike in October 1995, the 1997 budget would fortunately be tabled at a time when the overall macroeconomic picture is indicating a soft landing,&quot; Mayban Securities Research said, pointing to slower growth, a shrinking current account deficit and easing inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Malaysia's GDP grew at an 8.4 percent rate in the second quarter of 1996, compared with 9.6 percent growth for all of last year.</p>
<p>The current account deficit ballooned to 17.8 billion ringgit in 1995 from 10.9 billion the previous year, but economists are estimating a drop to 14-15 billion this year. Inflation has been capped at below four percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said one possible measure -- a corporate tax cut -- might already have been discounted by the market, but would still have a strong long-term impact on corporate earnings growth and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's valuation.</p>
<p>&quot;But the impact would not be immediate,&quot; Yong of Capitalcorp Securities said. &quot;At the moment, it's hard to find value in Malaysian stocks, particularly blue chips.&quot;</p>
<p>He said at 22 times current earnings, local stocks are fairly valued.</p>
<p>The benchmark Composite Index at midday on Monday was at a five-month high of 1,176.91, but was well below its all-time high of 1,332.04 set in January 1994 at the height of the &quot;super bull run&quot;.</p>
<p>O.S.K. Research said in a report on the budget that some sectors might benefit at the expense of others.</p>
<p>&quot;Taxing Paul to subsidise Peter is likely to be (Anwar's) strategy as he is unwilling to print more money,&quot; the report said.</p>
