<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Food to blame for disappointing South African CPI.</title>
<headline>Food to blame for disappointing South African CPI.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1996-10-23</dateline>

<p>Higher food prices were mainly to blame for a higher-than-expected consumer inflation rate in September, data from the Central Statistical Service (CSS) shows.</p>
<p>Increases in the indices for food accounted for 0.4 percentage point of the overall monthly increase of 1.0 point. Other contributors included tobacco (0.1 percentage point), housing (0.1), furniture and equipment (0.1), medical expenses (0.1), personal care (0.1) and all other items (0.1).  </p>
<p>The year-on-year rise in South Africa's all-items consumer price index in September was 8.4 percent versus August's 7.5 percent. A Reuters consensus poll of economists had forecast monthly and annual increases of 0.7 and 8.1 percent.</p>
<p>Food prices increased to an annual rate of 10.4 percent last month, 2.5 percentage points higher than the rate in August, and the first time since June 1995 that South Africa has had double-digit food inflation.</p>
<p>Big monthly increases were registered in the price of grain products (up 2.2 percent), meat (1.0), fish (2.7), dairy products (1.6) and vegetables (8.6).</p>
<p>Excluding food, the all-items index showed a more moderate increase of 0.8 percent month-on-month.</p>
<p>In the non-food area, there was a 0.1 percent month-on-month decrease in the price index for transport, reflecting a three cents per litre cut in the price of gasoline. But this was offset by higher prices for most other items.</p>
