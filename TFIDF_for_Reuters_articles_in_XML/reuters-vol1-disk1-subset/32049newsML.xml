<headline>Stocks edge up; bonds, dollar, oil weaken.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks edged higher but bonds fell Wednesday as investors shrugged off news of the second U.S. military strike against Iraqi targets and awaited Friday's jobs data.</p>
<p>Oil prices and the dollar closed lower after Iraqi troops withdrew from some Kurdish areas in northern Iraq and President Clinton said immediate U.S. goals had been met after a second missile attack on Iraqi military targets.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 8.51 points at 5,656.90. In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,370 to 927 on moderate volume of 351 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;At the present time both stocks and bonds are acting antsy about Friday's news,&quot; said Harry Laubscher, market analyst at Tucker Anthony. &quot;Investors are largely on the sidelines in advance of the jobs data.&quot;</p>
<p>The new round of missile attacks by the United States against Iraq early Wednesday continued to roil limited segments of the market, though oil stocks were only barely higher on the day.</p>
<p>Traders said the U.S. military intervention had largely faded as a market-moving factor, and most investors shifted to upcoming economic data, such as Friday's jobs report that is expected to help the Fed decide whether to raise or keep interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>Analysts on average expect non-farm payrolls to rise by 224,000 in August compared with July's 193,000 increase, while the unemployment rate is seen edging lower to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond was off one-half point and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7.10 percent from 7.06 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercatile Exchange October crude oil futures closed 16 cents a barrel lower at $23.24 and October heating oil closed 0.86 cent a gallon lower at 64.21 cents.</p>
<p>But selling was restrained by continued uncertainty about the Iraqi situation and other factors such as Hurricane Fran, a massive storm threatening the mid-Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p>October unleaded gasoline ended unchanged at 62.96 cents per gallon.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday the dollar was lower at 1.4805 German marks and 108.78 Japanese yen, compared with 1.4840 and 109.25 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It skidded to the day's low of 1.4783 marks in afternoon trading before clawing back some losses as Clinton announced the U.S. mission in Iraq had been achieved.</p>
<p>At the Commodity Exchange, December copper closed 1.45 cents per pound lower at 94.40 cents per pound following a sharp sell-off on the London Metal Exchange. But analysts said a rebound could occur due to a possible mine strike.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, improved sentiment about this year's corn and soybean crops pushed prices lower.</p>
<p>November soybeans closed 15-1/4 cents per bushel lower at $7.80-1/4 and December corn ended 8 cents per bushel lower at $3.33-1/2.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index finished 16.8 points up on the day, at 3,872.7. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average closed 3.72 points or 0.02 percent higher at 20,201.87.</p>
