<p>The Philippine government is optimistic a new tax package aimed at replacing a complicated and widely abused system will be virtually complete by the end of the year, a senior official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic that the comprehensive tax reform package will pass. The final version should come through by the end of the year,&quot; Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo told reporters late on Monday.</p>
<p>The package is crucial to the government's economic reform programme because it is designed to ensure a sustainable source of revenue.</p>
<p>But its implementation has been delayed in the legislature because of differing views over how beer and cigarettes should be taxed.</p>
<p>The package includes three parts. The first, on oil products, has already been approved. The second, on beer and cigarette taxes, is pending in the legislature.</p>
<p>The government hopes the third part of the package, which concerns individual taxes, will be finalised next year.</p>
<p>De Ocampo said the passage of the taxes on beer and cigarettes would mean the package was virtually complete because the last part was certain to be passed.</p>
<p>&quot;The last part is individual taxes...this is less controversial and passage should be easy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>De Ocampo told reporters the tax reform package was one of the most important tasks before the government to ensure the benefits of economic reform were sustained.</p>
<p>The Philippines had the lowest tax collection rate among East Asian countries, he said.</p>
<p>A Department of Finance official said national statistics showed at least seven million people should pay income tax but only some 2.6 million people pay.</p>
<p>About 200,000 firms were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission but only 70,000 filed returns and of these an even smaller amount paid tax.</p>
