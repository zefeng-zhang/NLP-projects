<title>USA: Shell Oil had record Q3.</title>

<p>Shell Oil Co Tuesday reported a record third quarter net income of $504 million, an increase of $90 million over the same quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Excluding special items in both quarters, adjusted net income in the third quarter of 1996 totaled $493 million, a record level for any quarter and an increase of $62 million or 14 percent over the 1995 quarter, the Royal/Dutch Shell Group subsidiary said.</p>
<p>Overall improvements in the third quarter of 1996 compared to the 1995 quarter were the result of higher average prices for crude oil and natural gas, the company said.  </p>
<p>In addition, 1996 refined product margins improved slightly and sales volumes increased for both refined products and chemicals over the 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>Special items increased net income $11 million for the latest quarter and reduced net by $17 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Oil and gas exploration and production income from ongoing operations in the third quarter of 1996 totaled $288 million, an increase of $142 million over 1995, Shell said.</p>
<p>Domestic crude oil prices averaged $18.20 per barrel, up $3.51 per barrel, while natural gas prices averaged $2.34 per thousand cubic feet, up $0.81 over the same 1995 period.  </p>
<p>Domestic production of crude oil in the third quarter of 1996 averaged 368,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 5,000 barrels per day from the same period in 1995 as new and increased production in the deep water Gulf of Mexico was offset by normal declines elsewhere. Natural gas production was virtually unchanged in the quarter.</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 1996, production began on schedule from Mars, a tension leg platform located in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. By the end of September, daily rates of production averaged 22,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of gas.  </p>
<p>Oil products income from ongoing operations was $111 million in the third quarter of 1996, a decrease of $22 million from 1995, as improved margins were partially offset by a higher level of scheduled manufacturing turnarounds.</p>
<p>Overall sales volumes of refined products in the third quarter of 1996 rose 3 percent over the same period last year. Sales of light oil products increased 8 percent, with auto gasoline sales volumes to branded service stations increasing 1 percent, Shell said.</p>
<p>Chemical products income from ongoing operations in the third quarter of 1996 was $114 million, a decrease of $94 million from 1995 on lower margins across most product lines due to lower selling prices. Overall, sales volumes increased, due mainly to higher sales of primary chemicals. In addition, costs were lower in the third quarter of 1996, as compared to the 1995 period and the prior 1996 quarters, reflecting decreased litigation expenses.</p>
