<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets near midday Tuesday were slow and not well tested, according to feedlot sources.</p>
<p>One load of heifers traded at $69.00 per cwt for cattle that had reportedly been on feed a little longer than usual, the sources said. However, details were not available regarding the quality of the heifers.</p>
<p>Top-quality cattle were bid $69.00 against asking levels of $71.00 to $72.00, they said.</p>
<p>Pricing attitudes were bolstered by ongoing light supplies of market-ready cattle, with many on showlists unfinished.  </p>
<p>Feedlot cattle prices also were seen supported by moderate beef demand as retailers continued to place beef orders to be shipped in time for early November features, sources said.</p>
<p>At midday, beef prices were uneven, but stabilizing and movement was moderate, sources said.</p>
<p>Boxed beef was quoted up $0.18 per cwt to down $0.34, with 161 fabricated loads sold, according to USDA. Choice heavyweight cuts were down $0.34 at $104.93.</p>
