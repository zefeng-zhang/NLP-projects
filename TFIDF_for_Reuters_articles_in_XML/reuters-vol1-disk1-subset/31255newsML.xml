<p>Asia-Pacific nations plan to make a concerted effort to provide better market access to small businesses that form the bedrock of the region's soaring economic growth, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ministers from the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group will meet in the central Philippine city of Cebu on Thursday and Friday to agree on measures to help keep small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) competitive as the region moves towards free trade, officials said.</p>
<p>Most of those at the meeting will be trade and industry ministers.</p>
<p>One of the main thrusts will be to get private sector groups, such as chambers of commerce, to help smaller companies which could be vulnerable in a free-trade regime.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussions ... are now going more strongly in the direction of private sector involvement and participation,&quot; said Melito Salazar of the Philippines, chairman of a group of APEC officials preparing for the ministerial meeting.</p>
<p>APEC must improve coordination between governments and private sector groups, said Japanese delegation head Akira Sadahiro, director general of the smaller business agency of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Government alone cannot implement the SME projects. There should be a coordination between the government and private sector. That is very important,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>APEC economies aim to bring down all trade barriers by 2010 for developed economies, and 2020 for developing economies.</p>
<p>Proposed projects focus on human resource development, information access, technology and technology sharing, financing and market access.</p>
<p>Smaller businesses account for more than 90 percent of all enterprises in APEC. Small enterprises usually have fewer than 100 employees, and medium ones usually fewer than 500.</p>
<p>Daniel McLaughlin, head of a U.S. trade mission on smaller firms, said information about market opportunities within the region should be made more accessible.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing that can occur is getting U.S. companies more information on this (Asia-Pacific) market,&quot; McLaughlin said in an interview. He forecast a &quot;tremendous boom&quot; in smaller business activity once this was done.</p>
<p>Maria Luisa Mabilangan-Haley, a board member of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, said trade financing was often a problem for smaller firms, who were likely to find local banks and finance houses unsupportive. They had less access to export credit agencies like the Eximbank and faced high service costs if they did manage to secure financing, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to work together to find ways for export credit agencies such as the Eximbank to support not only SMEs in the United States but also SMEs in APEC countries who want to purchase the 'tools' to build their society,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.</p>
