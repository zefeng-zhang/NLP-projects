<p>Polish shares fell in higher turnover for the fifth time running but analysts expected a brief rebound on revived demand following the market's 6.3 percent slide from its October 9 high of 15,078.7 points.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index fell 1.7 percent, to 14,133.4, and turnover rose 5.3 percent to 103.2 million zlotys ($36.8 million) on both markets as 55 issues fell, 10 rose and 15 were flat.</p>
<p>&quot;We are likely to have a brief one or two-session rebound as the market has already fallen significantly and some prices might look attractive again,&quot; said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Polska.</p>
<p>Some analysts said a downride to 14,000 or 13,500 points of the WIG index or stabilisation was likely as the market looked weak after its 90-percent rise since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Some analysts said banks, WIG's heavyweights, were the most vulnerable to profit-taking, or at least losing steam, after their growth this year.</p>
<p>But some saw a growth potential in the market and expected it to climb up to 15,500-16,000 points in late November or early December.</p>
<p>Traders said Zywiec brewer plunged 10 percent in a one-million-zloty ($0.4 million) turnover after the company said it was shutting down one of its breweries and sacking 145 of its 990 employees and after it showed unspectacular September earnings.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units rose 0.3 percent in a 16.6-million zloty ($5.9 million) turnover in the regular session and rose 3.4 percent in 21.7-million-zloty ($7.8 million) continuous trade.</p>
