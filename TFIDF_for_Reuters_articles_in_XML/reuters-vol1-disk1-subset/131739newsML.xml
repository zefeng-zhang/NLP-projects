<p>The European Commission said on Tuesday that confidence indicators pointed to an end to the economic slowdown which has been affecting the European Union since the end of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Judging by the business survey results extending into August, there are now clearer signs that the pause in growth is coming to an end,&quot; it said in its survey of economic sentiment for August/September.</p>
<p>The Commission said confidence in industry had picked up in August, as the number of firms planning to increase production over the following months outnumbered those willing to reduce output.</p>
<p>But it tempered its assessment saying that domestic and foreign demand remained &quot;far too low&quot; and the level of stocks &quot;excessive&quot;.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence also suggested a &quot;slight improvement&quot; in August mainly because people throughout the Union are &quot;less pessimistic&quot; about their own financial situation, the Commission said.</p>
<p>The Commission's somewhat brighter economic prospects for the bloc's economy are in line with its forecasts in May.</p>
<p>It said last spring that growth in gross domestic product would be 1.5 percent in 1996, down from a previous forecast of 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>The Commission blamed in particular the delayed effects of last year's monetary turbulence and the high level of interest rates in 1994 and 1995 for the bloc's economic downturn.</p>
<p>But it said the economy would recover during the second half of 1996 to reach 2.5 percent growth next year.</p>
<p>The Commission's regular autumn economic forecasts are expected by mid-November.</p>
