<p>IPE gas oil recovered much of their early losses by the close on Tuesday after a 100,000 barrel per day Venezuelan catcracker went down, brokers said.</p>
<p>Having touched a low of $227.50, Nov gas oil rallied to close at $230.75 per tonne, $3.50 lower than Monday's settlement, when Brent stood at $24.38 per barrel, 26 cents down on the day.</p>
<p>Dec Brent continued its climb after that, touching $24.67 per barrel by 1714 GMT, three cents up on the day. Traders said PDVSA's 100,000 bpd Amuay catcracker went down and a long repair time was expected.  </p>
<p>But gas oil failed to completely reverse the effect of some bearish news on Monday night, brokers said, when Colonial pipeline said it had received a surge in heating oil orders for the next 40 days.</p>
<p>Traders were waiting for the weekly stock data from the American Petroleum Institute after the close which are expected to show a one million barrel build in distillate stocks, according to a survey by Reuters. Crude stocks were expected to build by 200,000 barrels and gasoline was expected to fall by one million barrels.</p>
