<headline>Turkey considers security &quot;cordon&quot; in north Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>Turkey is considering the creation of a security cordon inside northern Iraq and has received an initial positive response from the United States to the proposal, the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The agency, quoting sources in Ankara which it did not identify, said Turkey had informed the United States of its wish to create a security cordon in northern Iraq, and that the initial U.S. reaction had been positive.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a security threat to Turkey in the area in question,&quot; said one source. &quot;The formation of such a cordon will be a passive security measure.&quot;</p>
<p>The report follows remarks by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller that Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas in northern Iraq had massed on the border, prompting Turkey to take &quot;necessary measures.&quot;</p>
<p>Government officials had no immediate comment on the report by Anatolian.</p>
<p>Turkey has long talked about increasing security of its long border with Iraq, by buying in electronic monitoring systems or permanently increasing troops in the area. It has also mentioned a security cordon in Iraq in the past, but these plans have never been realised.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died in a 12-year-long war between separatist Kurdish guerrillas and Turkey's armed forces in southeast Turkey. The PKK uses bases in northern Iraq to mount attacks inside Turkey.</p>
<p>Iraqi armed forces moved into Kurdish-held areas of northern Iraq last weekend, intervening on the side of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to capture the main city of Arbil from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
<p>Turkey has long argued that the lack of effective control over northern Iraq creates a power vacuum benefiting the Turkish PKK.</p>
