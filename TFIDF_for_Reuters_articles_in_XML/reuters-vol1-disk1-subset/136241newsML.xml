<p>British police said on Wednesday they had broken up an international drug ring that laundered millions of pounds in profits through British financial institutions.</p>
<p>A year-long operation, codenamed Grandad, ended with Brussels police seizing 5 kilos of pure heroin worth around 2 million pounds ($3.5 million) and the arrest of three men and a woman in London.</p>
<p>&quot;What we believe we have smashed today is an international heroin network,&quot; Southeast Regional Crime Squad spokeswoman Jackie Bennett told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This organisation was laundering multi, multi-millions of pounds through British financial institutions,&quot; said Bennett. He declined to name any of the institutions involved.</p>
<p>The four arrested in Britain were expected to be charged with drug trafficking offences on Thursday, Bennett said.</p>
<p>Two Turkish nationals were being questioned by police in Brussels and should be charged within the next few days. One was believed to have strong links with a Kurdish separatist group, Bennett said.</p>
<p>The operation involved more than 60 officers in London and liaison with law enforcement agencies around the world. Intelligence was passed to authorities in Canada and South Africa, leading to arrests and drug seizures, Bennett said.</p>
<p>The operation had led to drug seizures in Britain earlier this year, including 8 kilos of heroin and 6 kilos of cannabis.</p>
