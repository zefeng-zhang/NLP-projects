<p>Greece's state telecom OTE said it would raise prices by an average of 4.6 percent in 1997, hoping to boost its revenues by an additional 22.5 billion drachmas, its managing director told reporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rise was necessary to finance investments which aim at modernising OTE, improving services and ensuring competitiveness,&quot; Managing Director Petros Lambrou told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the steepest hike will concern local calls which will go up by 12.75 percent, well above expected 1997 inflation, and basic monthly charges which will rise by 12.12 percent.</p>
<p>The impact on the bill of the average OTE client would be a rise of 4.77 percent, slightly higher than the general average rise of 4.6 percent, Lambrou said.  </p>
<p>Long distance calls within Greece will cost 1.78 percent less on average while rates on international calls will show no change on average.</p>
<p>Calls to countries such as the U.S., Canada and Japan which are now among the most expensive at 245 drachmas a minute will go down to 200 drachmas a minute to fend off competition, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had increased consumption last year which made for better revenues. We hope to raise revenues again this year from an increase in consumption rather than higher prices,&quot; Lambrou said.</p>
<p>He explained that rates on Greece's local calls were among the cheapest in Europe while international calls were considered expensive. --Dina Kyriakidou, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
