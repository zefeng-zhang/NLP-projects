<title>USA: ADR REPORT - Mexican ADRs stage mild recovery.</title>
<headline>ADR REPORT - Mexican ADRs stage mild recovery.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican shares traded in the U.S. recovered some lost ground but suffered from thin U.S. volumes Wednesday as worries about U.S. interest rates kept investors sidelined.</p>
<p>&quot;It's kind of a rebound after yesterday. Cetes rates came in basically in line with expectations,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders expected investors to stay on the sidelines ahead of Friday's U.S. unemployment data.</p>
<p>&quot;That should give the market some indications on whether the Fed is going to tighten interest rates,&quot; one said.  </p>
<p>Telmex's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) inched up 1/4 to 33, while Tamsa rose 1/4 to 11-1/8, and Televisa held steady at 29-3/8 in afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Other Latin American shares were little changed on paltry volumes, with Brazil's Telebras off 1/4 at 74-1/4, Chile's CTC up 1/4 at 97-7/8 and Telefonica de Argentina down 3/8 at 23-3/4.</p>
<p>BAESA was one of the region's biggest gainers, bouncing 1/2 to 5-7/8 after its recent battering.  </p>
<p>In other activity, most foreign oil shares held their gains, although some investors did take profits after the stocks' rally Tuesday on the back of U.S. missile attacks against Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still perceiving that Iraqi oil is not going to be coming back on the market for awhile,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Elf gained 1/4 to 37-7/8, Total held steady at 37-7/8, Repsol shed 3/8 to 32-1/2, BP lost 5/8 to 118-5/8, Royal Dutch added 7/8 to 153-3/4 and YPF was unchanged at 21-5/8.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, Britain's Vodafone sank over seven percent, dropping 2-3/4 to 34-7/8 after NatWest's U.K. analyst downgraded the stock to hold from add.</p>
