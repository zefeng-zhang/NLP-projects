<headline>Wolseley retreats on cautious outlook.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Shares in Wolseley Plc lost an initial gain on Tuesday after cautious comment from the plumbing supplies company on the outlook for next year in its key U.S. and UK markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>The stock was down 13p at 494 by 1018 GMT, after initially rising 9p after results which came in at the top end of analyst expectations.</p>
<p>The stock set a record intraday high of 512p on October 10.  </p>
<p>&quot;The stock has had a good run, the figures were good, but there was just a note of caution regarding what happens if interest rates go up,&quot; said Steven Charnock, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.</p>
<p>&quot;Any increase in interest rates could have some impact.&quot;</p>
<p>Charnock said there was uncertainty over the direction of interest rates following the U.S. presidential election and the UK general election, which must be held by next May.</p>
<p>Yet he said Wolseley's results were strong and the stock continued to benefit from the company's global exposure. He left his fiscal 1997 estimate unchanged at 260 million stg.  </p>
<p>Michael Ruby, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said the results were better than expected after Wolseley's warning earlier this year that profits would be below those of a year before.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect people just felt that with the stock on a 20 percent premium to the market, that was probably just a bit too rich,&quot; Ruby said.  </p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Wolseley's chief financial controller Stephen Webster said he did not see an upturn in the next 12 months in France Austria or Germany.</p>
<p>He said it would probably be spring next year before the impact of an upturn in UK building was felt, and expressed concern about the threat of a rate rise in the U.S., which accounts for almost half of profits.</p>
<p>&quot;In the U.S. you only need one or two things to capsize confidence,&quot; Webster said. &quot;A half percent would not be a big deal but one percent could damage confidence.&quot;  </p>
