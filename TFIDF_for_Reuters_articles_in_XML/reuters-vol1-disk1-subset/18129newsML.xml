<p>Lithuania's huge Ignalina nulcear plant has closed down on after a reactor was shut on Tuesday, energy ministry officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A leak was detected in the reactor's cooling system.</p>
<p>The incident meant the plant, which meets roughly 85 percent of the small Baltic state's electricity needs, was completely shut as a second reactor was undergoing routine maintenance.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a minor leak in the cooling system of the reactor, but it had no impact on personnel or the environment,&quot; a senior ministry official told Reuters.</p>
<p>He added that the reactor would be restarted on September 3.</p>
<p>Lithuania's electricity needs are currently being met by the Elektrenai power plant, which burns heavy fuel oil.</p>
<p>Ignalina's two reactors are the largest of the infamous Chernobyl-style RBMK models operating in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Some incidents in recent years, including a bomb scare in November 1994 and a fire in a turbine room last autumn, have raised concerns about safety at the plant.</p>
