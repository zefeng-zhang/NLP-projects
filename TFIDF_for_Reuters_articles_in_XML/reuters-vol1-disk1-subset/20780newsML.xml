<headline>New Mexican guerrilla attacks add to market woes.</headline>

<p>Coordinated guerrilla attacks that killed 13 people in two southern states caused Mexican stocks to tumble and the peso to lose ground on Thursday, showing how fragile Mexico's financial markets remain.</p>
<p>Business leaders called for quick action, and Mexican Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said he hoped the attacks would be seen in their &quot;real context.&quot;</p>
<p>The attacks helped drive the main stock market index down 75.94 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 3,334.9, and weakened the peso by 4.0 centavos to 7.535 to the dollar.</p>
<p>Ortiz told reporters that the country's financial markets had been performing &quot;reasonably.&quot; Of the rebel attacks, he said, &quot;I hope that these actions will be taken in the real context in which they are occurring.&quot;</p>
<p>Many analysts said they thought the attacks were timed to embarrass President Ernesto Zedillo before he gave his second State of the Nation address on Sunday.</p>
<p>At least 13 people were killed and 21 injured when scores of masked rebels struck at police and military posts in Oaxaca and Guerrero states late on Wednesday in the biggest assaults in more than two years. A soldier and a sailor were also taken hostage, one governent official said.</p>
<p>Mexican business leaders said the surprise guerrilla raids could scare off foreign investment and called for a stern response from the government.</p>
<p>&quot;With a belligerent group like this that uses high-powered weapons, you can't fight them with holy water,&quot; Carlos Abascal, president of the employers association, told radio station Radio Red.</p>
<p>The attacks were in six towns in the two southern states, and appeared to be the work of a well-armed new rebel force calling itself the Popular Revolutionary Army, which emerged two months ago.</p>
<p>Part of the volatilty in Mexican markets was also due to the rise in the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. After hitting record highs this week, profit-taking on the Mexican stock market has also been widespread.</p>
<p>Analysts added that the impact of the guerrilla attacks has been cushioned by improving economic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;The fragility will continue for some time. There are still worries and volatility but with consistent economic improvement each time the volatility will be less,&quot; said Bancomer economist Javier Maldonado.</p>
<p>Economists said Mexico's economy was much stronger than just a few months ago. Second-quarter gross domestic product grew 7.2 percent, marking an end to the recession.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico said on Wednesday the nation had a current account surplus of $641 million in the second quarter, compared with a surplus of $441 million a year before.</p>
<p>Earlier guerrilla attacks in Mexico have combined with economic imbalances to devastating effect.</p>
<p>On Jan. 1, 1994, rebels in Chiapas seized six towns, starting a period of prolonged political uncertainty in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Dec. 19 the same year movements by Zapatista rebels and army troops in Chiapas, combined with growing concerns about the government's ability to pay its debts, sparked an exodus of dollars that led to a peso crisis that tipped the country into its deepest recession in half a century.</p>
