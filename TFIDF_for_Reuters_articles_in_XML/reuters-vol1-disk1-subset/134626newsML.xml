<headline>UK's NYNEX Cable unveils bundled packaging.</headline>

<p>NYNEX CableComms Group Plc, which is to merge with a number of other UK cable companies, said on Tuesday it would offer &quot;bundled' cable television and telephony packages beginning November 1.</p>
<p>&quot;The launch of the new product packages ahead of the Christmas period, which is traditionally our busiest time, should set us up for a strong final quarter and position us well for future growth,&quot; chief executive John Killian told a news conference.  </p>
<p>The company, currently part of U.S. telecom NYNEX Corp, later reported a nine-month net loss of 46.4 million stg against a loss of 57.8 million stg in the year-ago period, under UK generally-accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>Killian declined to comment on the plan by Cable and Wireless Plc, NYNEX, and Bell Canada International to merge their British units into one company. He added that NYNEX CableComms had yet to receive an official offer to form part of the merged company, which will be called Cable and Wireless Communications.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very limited in terms of what we can say,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Killian said he expected the new cable and telephony packages to boost revenues, increase the company's penetration and reduce churn -- the rate of customer loss -- although he declined to give specific forecasts.</p>
<p>The company currently had residential telephony penetration of over 25 percent and cable television penetration of about 20 percent, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Research shows that customers find competitively priced &quot;bundled' cable television and telephony packages very attractive and are more likely to stay loyal if they receive both services from one provider,&quot; Killian said.  </p>
<p>He added that the packages, which will include sports and movie offerings tailored to specific customer segments, were priced to compete with British Telecom and satellite TV broadcaster BSkyB.</p>
<p>He said the company will continue to offer telephone services at prices 25 percent below those of BT.</p>
<p>To promote the new packages, NYNEX CableComms launched a marketing campaign at an initial cost of about one million stg, Killian said.</p>
