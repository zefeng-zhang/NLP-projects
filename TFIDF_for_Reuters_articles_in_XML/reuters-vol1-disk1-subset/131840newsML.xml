<p>New Zealand share prices continued in a similar vein to last week by ending a stable Monday session slightly stronger, driven mostly by Telecom.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 6.70 points higher at 2,367.78 on turnover worth NZ$50 million, much of that generated by pre-market business in the Australian dual listed stocks.</p>
<p>The TeNZ index fund also boosted volume, with stock worth NZ$10.48 million trading.</p>
<p>Telecom shot up 10 cents to NZ$7.59, another record high, while the rest of the leaders had a mixed tone.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market was in positive territory all day, continuing in its uptrend of last week,&quot; Tim Koller at Hendry Hay McIntosh said. Koller said the mood of the market was stable, in part reflecting the lack of movement in the bond market.</p>
<p>A strong finish on Wall Street on Friday, where the Dow Industrials ended 35.03 points higher at 6,094.23, may have been a supportive factor, he said.</p>
<p>Outside the top five, the Air New Zealand group of shares and rights lost seven cents each after the company said its profit for the current year was likely to be lower than last year's outcome of NZ$225 million.  </p>
<p>The Air NZ A shares closed at NZ$2.73, the B shares at $3.55 and the rights at $1.45.</p>
<p>Nuplex, after announcing a one-for-one bonus issue, shot up 50 cents to NZ$6.80, the main attraction being the attachment to each bonus share of a NZ$0.54 tax imputation credit. Volume in in the resins company was very light.</p>
