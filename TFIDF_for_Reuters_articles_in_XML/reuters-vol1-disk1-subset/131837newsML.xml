<p>* Stronger currency drives NZ yields lower</p>
<p>* Market still short, rally maintains momentum</p>
<p>* 90-day bills seen going to 9.25 pct while currency holds</p>
<p>The big post election rally in the New Zealand debt market showed no sign of abating on Monday as a buoyant currency gave it another fillip.</p>
<p>Bank bill yields fell another 10 basis points, as traders figured the stronger currency countered any concern the Reserve Bank had about premature easing. The New Zealand dollar was nudging 71 U.S. cents.</p>
<p>&quot;The currency is going ballistic,&quot; said a bill trader.</p>
<p>Dealers doubted the RB will achieve its often expressed desire for a lower currency and higher interest rates.  </p>
<p>They said the local market remains short and that is likely to underpin yields in the short-term.</p>
<p>Politics has been shoved into the background as traders scramble to get aboard the rally.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just grinding lower. There is not a lot of stock to go. It gets sold two cents then someone wants to buy and it's just not there,&quot; an Auckland dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The currency has been the driving factor on the day.&quot;</p>
<p>High cash rates seemed to have no dampening effect.  </p>
<p>The Auckland dealer said offshore players appeared more comfortable than locals to ride out the political stalemate following the inconclusive October 12 election and so far they are laughing to the bank.</p>
<p>A bill dealer said he believed bank bills were more likely to go lower in yield yet than retrace.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it could head down to 9.25 percent, no problems from the Reserve Bank,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Bancorp said in a commentary that it was difficult to see how the RB could stand in the way of a market-led fall in short-term rates when inflation had proved in the September quarter to be significantly less than the bank's forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;For how much longer can the Reserve Bank stand against the tide?&quot; it asked.</p>
<p>In the long bonds, Bancorp said the key indicators to watch, apart from political developments, will be the peaking of the New Zealand dollar and a downturn in interest in eurokiwis.</p>
