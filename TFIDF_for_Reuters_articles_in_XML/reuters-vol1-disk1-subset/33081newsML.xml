<p>U.S. Plains cattle markets early Wednesday were quiet, with no sales reported, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>A few packer bids were reported at $69.00 per cwt, but owners continued to price cattle at $71.00 to $72.00, fully anticipating $70.00 sales this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Let a packer bid $70.00, and he'll get covered up with cattle,&quot; one west Texas feedlot operator said.</p>
<p>Last week's top price was $69.00, but feedlot cattle prices were expected to be lifted by light supplies of finished cattle and expectations for firm beef prices.  </p>
<p>Boxed beef prices were expected to be supported by strong demand amid talk that retail beef inventories got cleaned up during the three-day holiday weekend, market sources said.</p>
<p>With beef prices set to rebound from last week's decline, cattle sales could be seen later Wednesday or on Thursday, according to feedlot sources.</p>
<p>&quot;We could be fixing to see some excitement by the end of the week,&quot; one cattle feeder said.</p>
