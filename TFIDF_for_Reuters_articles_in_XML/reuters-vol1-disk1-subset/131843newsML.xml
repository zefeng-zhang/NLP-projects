<p>The Australian share market ended firm on Monday, just a few points away from its record closing high after resource stocks found support on the back of a firmer copper price and another record close for the Dow on Friday.</p>
<p>The key share market barometer, the All Ordinaries index, closed 8.2 points higher at 2,363.2, three points off its all time record high closing level of 2,366.2, set last week.</p>
<p>Brokers said buying support for key blue chip resource issues CRA and BHP underpinned market gains during the session.</p>
<p>&quot;The last few sessions have been similar, with the market swelling through to lunch but pulling back in the afternoon,&quot; a a dealer from a Perth-based brokerage said.</p>
<p>The dealer said this trade pattern revealed the cautiousness of local investors who were keen to take profits early and reluctant to hold long positions overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;The concern is with a possible Dow pullback,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although earnings reports are backing up the bulls on Wall Street, the worry is that the U.S. market is fundamentally overbought and is due for a sharp correction,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Anaconda Nickel was a star performer after the company released its annual report. In the report, Anaconda said it was close to naming an equity partner for its Murrin Murrin nickel project in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Anaconda shares ended 46 cents higher at A$3.80.</p>
<p>Foster's Brewing ended weaker after an arbitration panel ruling in Canada on Friday which ended a licensing agreement between its 40 percent owned Canadian brewer Molson and U.S. brewer Coors. Fosters shares closed three cents lower at A$2.37.</p>
