<title>USA: No violations of new no-fly zone in Iraq - Pentagon.</title>
<headline>No violations of new no-fly zone in Iraq - Pentagon.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>The Pentagon said on Wednesday that the United States and its allies had begun patrolling an expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq and there had been no violations so far by Iraqi aircraft.</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, deputy chairman of the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, also denied a report in an Iraqi government newspaper that Iraq had shot down a &quot;hostile pilotless plane&quot; over its southern province of Missan. &quot;We have no evidence that that is true,&quot; he told reporters.  </p>
<p>Ralston told a briefing for reporters at the Pentagon that U.S., British and French aircraft began patrolling the new no-fly zone in southern Iraq in an operation called &quot;Southern Watch&quot; at noon local time (0800 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;So far in operation 'Southern Watch' the enforcement of no-fly zone this morning, we noted no violations,&quot; Ralston said. &quot;And as a matter of fact prior to the enforcement of the no-fly zone we noticed the departure of some aircraft from the airfields.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday announced an expansion of the no-fly zone in southern Iraq from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel just south of Baghdad, as part of its retaliation for Iraqi attacks on Kurds in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Pentagon denial of the downing of an aircraft followed a report in the Iraqi government al-Jumhouriya newspaper that Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners shot down a &quot;hostile pilotless plane&quot; over its southern province of Missan. The report was not repeated by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) and it was not confirmed by the Iraqi General Command.</p>
