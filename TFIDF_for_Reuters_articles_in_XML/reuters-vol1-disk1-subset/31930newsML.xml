<p>China on Wednesday accused the United States of using missile strikes against Iraq to bolster its military presence in the Gulf and boost President Clinton's image.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike served... Clinton's need to strengthen his image and influence as a world political leader at home so as to win the upcoming presidential elections in November,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary.</p>
<p>The strike was a ploy to expand U.S. military presence in the Gulf to reinforce its control of the oil-rich region, Xinhua said, quoting what it described as an &quot;Oriental military expert&quot; whom it did not identify.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. desperately needed to make a good show in containing the Iraqis to offset its impotence in bolstering the stalled peace process&quot; in the Middle East, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday China's Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed deep regret and grave concern over the missile attacks and renewed tension in the Gulf.</p>
<p>Xinhua said the U.N. resolution cited by Washington as justification for the raid provided a &quot;shaky legal foundation&quot; for military action as it did not specifically authorise the use of force or the establishment of &quot;no-fly zones&quot;.</p>
<p>The missile strike had not achieved its aim because the attack had triggered widespread criticism and condemnation from the Arab world and other countries including some allies of the United States, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday fired 27 cruise missiles at about 15 targets in southern Iraq in response to an incursion by Iraqi troops into Kurdish territory in the north of the country.</p>
<p>On Wednesday U.S. ships in the Gulf launched 17 more missiles to ensure that all the targets had been destroyed.</p>
