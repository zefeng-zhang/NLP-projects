<p>White sugar futures edged slightly lower in late Wednesday dealings with activity focusing on nearby switches, traders said.</p>
<p>Business was largely routine with major players away attending a week-long industry gathering in London.</p>
<p>Traders said late buying on the dips helped support prices.</p>
<p>By 1535 GMT, December was down $1.10 at $315.80 a tonne, just barely above a major test support at $315.00.</p>
<p>Analysts said a move below $315.00 would see the market falling the next support at $310.</p>
<p>Second-position March was 40 cents off at $313.20.</p>
<p>In spreads, active Dec/March and Dec/May switches were dealt at $2.50 each.</p>
<p>Overall volume reached 1,390 lots.</p>
<p>In fundamental news, traders confirmed Libya has bought two cargoes of 45 ICUMSA white sugar for December shipment.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was talk that Libya could have booked up to four cargoes, one for November delivery and three for December. Elsewhere, news Brazil has approved a final tranche of 1.04 million tonnes of tax-free sugar exports from the 5.2 million export limit was within trade expectation and had no impact.</p>
<p>The market also ignored news of damage to the Cuban sugar cane crop following a hurricane after Havana said the island still aimed to improve on last year's 4.45 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Paris sugar were also slightly lower with March easing 20 cents at $313.20.</p>
