<title>UK: S&amp;P rates Total Access Communication debt.</title>
<headline>S&amp;P rates Total Access Communication debt.</headline>

<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Tuesday it assigned its BBB minus foreign currency long-term rating to Total Access Communication's (TAC) forthcoming note and bond issue, totaling $400 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The rating reflects TAC's strong financial performance, market positioning, and strategic focus in the fast-growing Thai mobile telecommunications industry,&quot; S&amp;P said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Offsetting strengths are an aggressive capital expenditure program and continued regulatory uncertainty in the Thai telecommunications sector,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>The agency said the outlook was stable.</p>
<p>TAC is the second-largest mobile phone company in Thailand, and has captured about 41 percent of the mobile market since commencing operations in 1991, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>The Thai cellular market has grown rapidly over recent years, growing by an average annual rate of 70 percent between 1991 and 1995, the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for mobile phones in Thailand has been fueled by strong economic growth, long waiting lists for fixed-line services, continued traffic problems in Bangkok, reductions in the prices of handsets, and domestic long-distance charges that are often cheaper using mobile phones,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>TAC is in the final phase of a network expansion, which resulted in debt levels growing to over Thai baht 7 billion, or US$280 million, by end-December 1995, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>&quot;Debt levels should peak at about twice this level in 1996. This rapid network expansion also has been accompanied by strong subscriber growth, and despite growing debt levels, interest coverage ratios have remained high throughout this period.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the network expansion is completed, capital expenditure should reduce to more sustainable levels, and TAC's strong cash flows are projected to quickly reduce the gross debt burden,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
