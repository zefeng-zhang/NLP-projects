<p>Rwanda denied on Wednesday Zairean accusations that Rwandan troops had invaded eastern Zaire and said exiled Rwandan militiamen were carrying out genocide in the Kivu region.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana, at a news conference, urged the 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire to return home and said Zaire was giving sanctuary to exiled Interahamwe militiamen largely responsible for Rwanda's 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire is still harbouring this killing machine of the Interahamwe, and the idea of genocide has been exported to eastern Zaire where those carrying it out are being recruited, with the complicity of Zairean authorities,&quot; Gasana said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsis) are being attacked, but what will happen is that tomorrow another group will be attacked and killed, and then another,&quot; said Gasana, a Hutu in a government which is largely controlled by the Tutsi minority.</p>
<p>&quot;This killing machine will go on and the Interahamwe will carry on killing until they are supreme in the region. The population is being exterminated in eastern Zaire,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gasana urged the international community to put pressure on Zaire to stop the killings.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire is a problem...We cannot do anything about Zaire. The international community cannot do anything about Zaire. Zaire cannot do anything about Zaire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire is not such a big baby that it needs to be baby sat by the international community all the time...It should take responsibility for itself.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Rwanda had no intention of intervening in Zaire. &quot;An external conflict is not in our best interests,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;These accusations are baseless and are being used by the Zaireans as an excuse to continue the extermination of people in eastern Zaire,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis who left Rwanda generations ago. The Zairean government says Rwanda and Burundi, which have the same ethnic mix, are helping them destabilise eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Gasana said former Rwandan Hutu soldiers exiled in Zaire wanted to attack Rwanda and were backed by the Zairean army.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Interahamwe and ex-FAR (Rwandan government forces) launch an attack we are not saying that we will not take action. But for the moment we watch and wait,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>Zairean government spokesman Boguo Makeli said on Tuesday that soldiers from Rwanda and Burundi had attacked South Kivu province and Rwandan soldiers had launched raids inside North Kivu.</p>
<p>In Nairobi, a Rwandan Hutu refugee lobby group, the Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR), supported the Zairean charges that Rwandan troops had attacked.</p>
<p>It said in a statement the Rwanda Patriotic Front, which is now the Rwandan government army, planned to &quot;suffocate&quot; Hutu refugee camps in the region before destroying them and would seize it to redraw their borders set by colonial powers.</p>
<p>It said Rwanda's External Security Organisation had sent hit squads of nearly 300 agents to Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Goma and Bukavu in Zaire to destabilise Hutu refugee organisations.</p>
<p>It said 600 Rwandan soldiers had infiltrated into Goma and Bukavu -- some of them disguised as refugees -- to seize and hold airports in the towns to block Zairean army reinforcements.</p>
<p>&quot;Attacks against refugee camps are to be carried out from the rear in order to push refugees into Rwanda where they will be massacred by the RPF army,&quot; the lobby group added.</p>
