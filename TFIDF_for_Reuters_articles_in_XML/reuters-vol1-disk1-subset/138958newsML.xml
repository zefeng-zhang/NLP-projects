<p>The chairman of Hong Kong's stock exchange said on Thursday that China could be trusted to nurture financial markets after the territory was handed over to Beijing next year.</p>
<p>&quot;China has extensive commercial interests in Hong Kong...it can be trusted to behave pragmatically,&quot; Edgar Cheng Wai-Kin told a business conference in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The stock exchange chairman said Hong Kong's financial markets were in good shape and would become even more important in the future.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has the sixth largest Foreign Exchange market in the world and its stock market is the eighth largest -- the biggest in Asia after Japan.</p>
<p>The task was to maintain the integrity of existing regulatory institutions, now run by Hong Kong people who would be staying on after the handover, said Cheng.</p>
<p>There were fears there would be an upsurge in fraud and other malpractices as the handover neared but these were not borne out, he said.</p>
<p>Standards had continued to rise and accountability to shareholders had developed to a previously unheard of extent.</p>
<p>&quot;China has no interest in any decline in commercial morality,&quot; said Cheng, who serves on the Chinese commission that will organise the handover.</p>
<p>Britain's senior trade commissioner in Hong Kong, Francis Cornish, agreed that Hong Kong will remain the main trade centre in the Asian-Pacific region after 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest danger has been that of unintentional harm after China takes control, but that danger is diminishing as Chinese officials gain more experience in external affairs,&quot; Cornish told the conference.</p>
