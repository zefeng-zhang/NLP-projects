<p>The European Union must press ahead in 1997 with ambitious plans to create more jobs in order to restore popular support for the bloc, European Commission President Jacques Santer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Presenting the EU executive's annual work programme to the European Parliament, Santer said that preparation for a single European currency, completion of a review of the EU's treaty and progress on enlargement eastwards were also key issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The main priority...is implementation of the confidence pact for employment,&quot; Santer said, referring to his plans to boost jobs.</p>
<p>Santer defended the plans, which were again rejected by EU finance ministers last week, to spend more than $1 billion on trans-European road and rail projects.</p>
<p>Member states are worried about meeting tough budget and debt targets to qualify for economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;It's not an empty gesture,&quot; Santer said. &quot;Unemployment undermines the confidence of EU citizens. We must restore that confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Santer's streamlined work programme was in sharp contrast to voluminous and grandiose plans proposed in the past by some of his predecessors.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission is convinced that we must act less in order to act better,&quot; he reiterated. But he stressed, &quot;In 1997, as before, it will not baulk at taking steps whenever it believes that a contribution from the Union is needed....&quot;</p>
<p>Santer said the Commission was right to insist on strict budgetary spending limits in preparation for a single EU currency on January 1, 1999, which he expected a &quot;significant&quot; number of member states to join.</p>
<p>&quot;Soon we shall see the beneficial effects on employment. That's our true objective. EMU is only a means,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Commission also plans next year to make progress on completing the internal market in gas, to draft rules for biotechnology and to draw up a European company statute.</p>
<p>It also intends to make proposals to provide people better access to continuing training schemes and use of new skills.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Santer said the EU must change the way it works in order to prepare for the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;Enlargement makes this even more necessary,&quot; he said, referring to the prospective membership of eastern European and Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Maintaining (decision-making) unanimity seems to me inconceivable in a Union of 20 or more members,&quot; he said, warning that otherwise the EU would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Santer's reiteration of the need to cut back on member states' right to veto decisions was likely to enrage Eurosceptics, particularly in Britain, fighting to hold back federalist forces.</p>
<p>The EU was set to expand eastwards and in 1997, after the intergovernmental conference is over, the Commission will issue opinions on the membership applications, Santer said.</p>
<p>The Commission will take account of the heavy impact of enlargement on farm and regional spending when it draws up a report next year on financial guidelines from 2000 onwards.</p>
