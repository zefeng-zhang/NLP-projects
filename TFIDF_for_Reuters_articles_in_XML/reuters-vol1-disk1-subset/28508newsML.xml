<p>Despite job growth, lower unemployment and solid corporate profits, Labour Secretary Robert Reich said Tuesday that the pay and benefits of many workers are still lagging.</p>
<p>In his annual post-Labour Day assessment of the American workplace, Reich said improving the lot of lagging workers remains a challenge for the Clinton administration and sounded his favourite themes as a remedy.</p>
<p>&quot;Meeting this challenge requires four things, all of which this administration is pursuing and will continue to pursue into the next century -- into the next century,&quot; he declared with implied optimism over the November presidential election.</p>
<p>Lagging workers, said Reich, need a growing economy with continued deficit-reduction, better access to education and job skills and expanded pension and health coverage protection.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, we will assure that working people can exercise their right to unionize as a means of getting a fair share of the gains from their labours,&quot; he told a meeting of the Centre for National Policy, a self-styled progressive research group.</p>
<p>On the positive side, Reich cited the creation of 10 million jobs since 1993 and a jobless rate of 5.4 percent in July, down froom 5.7 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p>Although he has long cited a downward trend in workers' inflation-adjusted median wages as a troublespot in the economy, Reich said recent data pointed to a rebound.</p>
<p>Labour Department Chief Economist Lisa Lynch, however, said more evidence is needed before the downtrend, which began in the 1970s, can be declared over.</p>
<p>Clinton has proposed targeted tax breaks for the cost of post-secondary education and training, but Reich admonished employers to boost their training budgets as well, asserting that their spending on training has failed to keep pace with the growth of the workforce over the past 12 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Left unchecked, this failure to invest (in training) will retard our economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;We have already laid the growndwork. We plan to do more. But the private sector has to do its part as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Reich listed seven trends he foresees in the workplace, including that many new jobs will be technical in nature that will not require a college degree, but will require training in basic technical skills. These jobs, which add value to more traditional work, will provide workers with opportunities to achieve middle class incomes, he added.</p>
<p>The five other trends Reich foresees are continued low unemployment rates that do not raise inflation, growing job insecurity, corporate cutbacks on pensions and health care coverage for workers, expanded opportunities for women and minorities and a comeback for unions driven by feeling of worker vulnerability and a desire for bargaining power.</p>
