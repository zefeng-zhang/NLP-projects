<p>One day before the start of opening arguments in the O.J. Simpson civil case, attorneys for both sides prepared on Tuesday to unveil their strategies to the jurors who will decide the wrongful-death lawsuit.</p>
<p>The course of the trial could be decided by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, who was set to rule at the start of Wednesday's court session on several key motions filed by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman want to bar the defence from referring to former police detective Mark Fuhrman's no-contest plea to perjury and from talking about his alleged racism.</p>
<p>Simpson's lawyers have said they will use the same tactics the defence used in last year's criminal trial to back their theory that he was the victim of a police conspiracy involving planted evidence and bungled investigations. The former football star was acquitted by a predominantly black jury on Oct. 3, 1995, in the murders of his ex-wife and her friend.</p>
<p>Fuhrman, one of the first detectives at the murder scene on June 12, 1994, and the man who discovered some of the key evidence, pleaded no contest to a charge of perjury this month and was sentenced to three years' probation.</p>
<p>He was accused by lawyers in the criminal case of being a racist who planted the bloody glove found on Simpson's estate.</p>
<p>After the defence produced audiotapes of him using racial epithets, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He has since retired and in a recent TV interview denied planting evidence and apologised for the racial slurs.</p>
<p>Simpson's lawyer, Robert Baker, argued on Monday that Fuhrman &quot;will be a witness in this case regardless of whether he is present or not present&quot; so the defence should be allowed to refer to his perjury plea and his alleged racist views.</p>
<p>In addition to a directive to the defence not to refer to Fuhrman's plea, the plaintiffs want Fujisaki to explain to the jury the difference between criminal and civil cases. &quot;Unlike probably any other case in history, every single juror knows that there was a prior criminal case,&quot; according to the motion filed by attorneys for the victims' families.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the jurors have expressed a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding about the relationship between the prior criminal case and this civil case,&quot; the motion said. &quot;This confusion is exacerbated by the fact that defendant was acquitted in the criminal case.&quot;</p>
<p>No court session was scheduled on Tuesday to give lawyers time to put the finishing touches on their opening statements. The families' attorneys will have the first chance to sway the jury, then the defence team will make its presentation before testimony gets under way.</p>
<p>Unlike a criminal trial in which a jury must reach a verdict &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; in a civil trial the rules are less stringent, based on &quot;a preponderance of evidence.&quot; Also the jury verdict does not have to be unanimous and may be reached by as little as a 9-3 majority.</p>
<p>The civil trial, in which Simpson could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages if found responsible for the murders, is set to start after a month of jury selection. After questioning of some 200 potential jurors, a mostly white 12-person panel was sworn in on Friday and eight alternates -- five of them white -- were seated on Monday.</p>
<p>The racial makeup of the jury could be crucial since potential jurors were divided during questioning largely along racial lines, with blacks tending to believe Simpson was innocent and most whites believing he probably was guilty. Simpson is black; both victims were white.</p>
