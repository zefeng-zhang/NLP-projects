<headline>UK gilt repo market quiet, eyes monetary meeting.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>UK money market and gilt repo rates ended easier after a subdued session which saw little activity ahead of the monetary meeting, due to begin in late afternoon.</p>
<p>Gilt repo business was dominated by a handful of special stocks, including the 6.0 percent gilts due 1999, which traded at 4.0 percent overnight and were reported at around 4.5 percent for one week.</p>
<p>The 8.0 percent gilts due 2003 were quoted at 5.0 percent for one month and 5.30 for one week while the 7.0 percent gilts of 2001 were trading around 20 points below general collateral (GC) levels.</p>
<p>Overnight GC ended at around 5.0 percent, down from late highs around 7.0 percent seen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This reflected movements in the unsecured market, where rates tailed off from opening highs after the Bank of England forecast a smaller than expected shortage of 600 million stg, later revised up to 650 million.</p>
<p>The Bank provided assistance totalling 600 million stg. It also allotted a total of 2.851 billion stg in repurchase and secured loan facilities at 5-23/32 percent.</p>
<p>Overnight cash was quoted at 5-13/16 11/16 in late business, dwon from the previous seven percent.</p>
<p>&quot;All eyes are, hopefully, on an early round tomorrow to indicate whether there is any movement on interest rates,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George began their monetary meeting at around 1500 GMT, which meant any change in interest rates was unlikely to be signalled until Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people in the market are not expecting a rate cut but they won't be surprised if it happens,&quot;  a repo trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;If Clarke is going to do it, he'd better do it now. The longer he leaves it, the more difficult he will find it, either because the data will pick up or because the U.S. will tighten.&quot;</p>
