<p>London robusta coffee futures ended narrowly firmer in quiet dealings on Friday ahead of a long weekend in the United States.</p>
<p>The benchmark November contract received a last-minute boost, ending $16 higher at the top of the day's range at $1,635 a tonne.</p>
<p>But the move stalled before a chart gap of $30 extending upwards from $1,650 -- a key technical resistance.</p>
<p>Traders said gains were capped by origin selling above the market. &quot;There is no buying when prices go up and there is no selling when they go down,&quot; said one trader. &quot;There seems to be no real reason to do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall volume totalled a modest 2,757 lots.</p>
<p>Light switches were traded with Nov/Jan at $40 a tonne and Sept/Nov at $35-40, traders said.</p>
<p>There was no fundamental news to guide the market and traders expected little activity on Monday when the New York arabicas market will be closed for Labour Day.</p>
<p>Broker GNI said the long weekend in the U.S., along with the issue of the CFTC Commitment of Traders report and the stock figures on Tuesday evening, might induce some book-squaring during Friday's session.</p>
<p>&quot;However, if roasters are tight, fears that the introduction of the 13 percent ICMS tax cut in Brazil may cause delays in shipments may tighten the market,&quot; GNI said in its daily report.</p>
