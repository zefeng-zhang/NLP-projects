<p>Poland's left-dominated parliament on Wednesday decided that former communist military strongman Wojciech Jaruzelski should not be prosecuted for his 1981 declaration of martial law to crush the Solidarity union.</p>
<p>Parliament, where two parties rooted in the pre-1989 communist system hold a majority, voted 211 to 146 with 60 abstentions to abandon proceedings against General Jaruzelski over his clampdown on the Soviet bloc's first free trade union.</p>
<p>If parliament's decision had gone the other way, Jaruzelski and several other top former communists would have faced trials in a special court for top officials, the State Tribunal.</p>
<p>&quot;I accept it (the vote) with satisfaction for understandable reasons,&quot; Jaruzelski, 73, told PAP news agency.</p>
<p>He said he had been ready to face trial and was sure the court would have vindicated his views that martial law was necessary to avert the threat of a Soviet military invasion and end the economic crisis crippling Poland at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Until this day I regret the various harm, suffering and indignities inflicted upon many people...but all things considered it (martial law) was the lesser evil,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The martial law decree led to the arrest of thousands of opposition activists, sent tanks on to the streets and sparked a wave of labour unrest, crushed by riot police.</p>
<p>During clashes at the Wujek colliery in southern Poland, police shot dead nine protesting miners.</p>
<p>Opposition groups said Jaruzelski's trial would have been an act of historic and moral justice and would have showed that no politician could escape responsibility for his deeds.</p>
<p>&quot;The ex-communists managed to defend their former party colleague,&quot; Andrzej Potocki, spokesman for the Union for Freedom party, told Reuters after the vote -- which also lets some other martial law leaders, including then interior minister General Czeslaw Kiszczak, off the hook.</p>
<p>Lech Walesa -- Solidarity's founder, who spent nearly 12 months in jail under martial law -- commented: &quot;No one will escape justice. History will judge them all.&quot;</p>
<p>Jozef Oleksy, leader the ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance, hailed the decision, saying it would help Poland to bury its painful past and focus on the future.</p>
<p>Advocates of Jaruzelski, who was briefly president after the 1989 fall of communism, have praised him for his contribution to the peaceful dismantling of the old communist system during talks with the opposition.</p>
<p>The Jaruzelski case was opened five years ago when groups which had struggled to overthow communism were still in power.</p>
<p>They reached no conclusion because subsequent parliaments were dissolved ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>In 1993, the ruling coalition of ex-communists and the Peasant party won elections, on a wave of discontent with pains associated with market reforms and further delayed the debate.</p>
<p>Last year, Walesa failed to be re-elected president and former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski took over.</p>
<p>Jaruzelski still faces trial in the port city of Gdansk over the shooting by security forces in 1970 of dozens of demonstrators during protests sparked by food price rises. He was defence minister at the time. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
