<p>German Bund futures climbed in late trade on Tuesday after breaking through technical resistance at 99.70 and traders said they are optimistic about the market's near-term direction.</p>
<p>The December Bund future was up 20 basis points at 99.78 in late trade, near its high of the day of 99.79.</p>
<p>Bunds outperformed their U.S. counterparts with the spread widening out to 67 basis points from 64 basis points. The U.S. market was relatively hurt by worries about upcoming supply.</p>
<p>Traders said they expect Bunds to trade narrowly, but that the market should be able to recover from recent weakness.  </p>
<p>Markets were closely monitoring talks between unions and employers in the German metal industry to see if labour will agree to packages that will show little inflationary threat from wages.</p>
<p>But traders said they were more worried about the direction of U.S. bonds and are looking for Bunds to continue to outpace their U.S. counterparts, especially if upcoming U.S. economic data such as durable goods are weak.</p>
<p>Traders said optimism boosting high-yielding markets such as Italy was also pulling Bunds higher.</p>
