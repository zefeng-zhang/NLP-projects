<p>French shares finished easier on Wednesday but clung stubbornly to above the psychologically important 2,000 level on the CAC-40 index.</p>
<p>Despite London surging to new highs and Wall Street advancing, traders said Paris was mired in gloom over the franc's fragility, a poor corporate earnings outlook and low expectations for the 1997 budget and tax reforms.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 15.09 points or 0.75 percent at 2,002.90 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,001 from 2,020.5 on Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was a moderate 3.4 billion francs.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac sought to inject some optimism into ministers who gathered for the first cabinet meeting since the summer break, while Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the government would move into top gear to tackle high unemployment.</p>
<p>CGT union leader Louis Viannet attacked the 1997 budget but stopped short of calling for a strike or joining a protest march called by the Force Ouvriere union for September 21.</p>
<p>Teacher unions have called for a national strike at the end of September but so far there has been no general strike similar to that which practically paralysed France late last year.</p>
<p>Chemicals group Rhone-Poulenc ended unchanged at 134.50 francs, after recovering from earlier weakness. Broker Leven upgraded the stock to a &quot;speculative buy&quot; from &quot;neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>Reinsurance firm Scor continued firm, up six francs at 208. Scor was seen as a possible bid target following Swiss Re's acquisition of Prudential's M&amp;G unit. Leven upgraded Scor to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; and set a target of 260 francs per share, while Du Bouzet sees the share hitting 250.</p>
<p>Computer systems house Cap Gemini finished 6.50 francs up at 222, or 3.02 percent, supported by positive sentiment following its 21 percent increase in first-half sales, higher than expected.</p>
<p>Axime, another systems specialist, firmed 14 francs to 576 or 2.49 percent, benefiting from a rebound after recent sharp falls.</p>
