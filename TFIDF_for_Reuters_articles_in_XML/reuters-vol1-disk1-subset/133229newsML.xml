<p>President Boris Yeltsin, forced to change tactics by a Kremlin power struggle which spun out of his control, has launched a new campaign to ensure stability in Russia when he goes under the surgeon's knife.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who is due to have heart surgery next month, scrapped a plan to play the various Kremlin rivals off against each other by sacking Alexander Lebed on Thursday after the security tsar's political manoeuvres upset the balance.</p>
<p>Acting fast to repair the damage caused by Lebed, Yeltsin has replaced him with an entirely different man in Ivan Rybkin, a former parliamentary speaker who is regarded as a loyal ally.</p>
<p>He has also set up a four-man council grouping his prime ministers, the head of the Kremlin administration and the speakers of the two houses of parliament and urged them to work together on important decisions.</p>
<p>Yeltsin hopes to calm waters made stormy by Lebed's four months in office and to head off any confrontation with the opposition-dominated parliament while he is out of the Kremlin. The aims are stability and keeping Yeltsin's own team in office.</p>
<p>&quot;The new council will be like a regent's council. The main task will be to consolidate certain forces and carry out the role of the president while the president is seriously ill,&quot; political analyst Sergei Markov said in a television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The second task of the new council is to consolidate the political elite -- a process which has been under way for a long time but is still on the agenda. This consolidation is needed to minimise the cost of the conflicts in the Russian leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether the council takes on such powers remains in doubt.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old president gave no details of its functions when he unveiled his plans on Monday at a meeting with Gennady Seleznyov, the communist chairman of the State Duma lower house of parliament who will be one of the council's &quot;permanent four&quot;.</p>
<p>The other members will be Kremlin chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the Federation Council upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>Seleznyov's presence ensures that the communists, the main opposition force, will at least be sure of getting its views heard on major decisions.</p>
<p>Yeltsin may be hoping that this will soften the communists' opposition in disputes on such issues as the government's draft 1997 budget, which is opposed by the communists, and the unpaid wages and pensions owed to millions of Russians.</p>
<p>But the uncertainty over the council's powers and when it will meet has prompted speculation over Yeltsin's aims as he prepares for surgery next month.</p>
<p>&quot;I am far from thinking that the committee will fulfill the role of a regent's council,&quot; said Vyacheslav Nikonov, an adviser in Yeltsin's successful election campaign earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced this council will not have very wide powers because Yeltsin will never allow too much power to go to a state organ which includes an opposition representative.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said Yeltsin was trying to make a &quot;yes man&quot; of Seleznyov just as he did with Rybkin, his predecessor as Duma speaker. Rybkin, a leftist, became a loyal ally after being promoted onto Yeltisn's elite Security Council.</p>
<p>&quot;It cannot be ruled out that they have decided to act in the same way with Gennady Seleznyov as they did with Ivan Rybkin,&quot; who talked exclusively about being 'doomed to agreement' after he was co-opted into the Security Council,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Ten months after Seleznynov replaced him as Duma speaker, Rybkin is back in high-level politics as Security Council secretary. He has signalled he is ready to toe Yeltsin's line.</p>
<p>The removal of Lebed, Chernomyrdin's main rival if a presidential election were called early, has also strengthened Chubais and Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Yeltisn has handed some of his powers to Chernbomyrdin but Chubais' influence is widely thought to be immense.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering that the president will for the next three to four months be very occupied...the state is going into the joint control of the prime minister and the head of the presidential administration,&quot; the Sevodnya newspaper said.</p>
<p>It said some power also lay with Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, who helped plot his re-election and now provided &quot;an informal symbol of legitimate authority&quot; behind the scenes.</p>
