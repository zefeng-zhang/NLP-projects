<p>Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole on Tuesday carefully avoided criticizing President Bill Clinton's missile attacks on Iraq and voiced strong support for the U.S. forces involved.</p>
<p>Speaking to U.S. war veterans in the midst of a four-day campaign trip, Dole saved his venom for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein -- whom he called a butcher and a tyrant -- and adopted a bipartisan tone as he spoke about Clinton's foreign policy.</p>
<p>&quot;In matters like this, all of us think not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans,&quot; Dole said. &quot;As Americans, we wish our troops success and safety.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are freedom's heroes and we support them without hesitation or reservation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dole, who had criticized Clinton for &quot;weak leadership&quot; on Monday, said he had the &quot;privilege&quot; of speaking to the president about Iraq on Tuesday morning and saved his fire for the Iraqi leader.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is one clear lesson of our century it is this: when aggression is tolerated it multiplies,&quot; Dole said. &quot;I trust this is the beginning of decisive action to limit the power and arrogance of Saddam Hussein.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He (Saddam) has persecuted his people, he has defied the international community time and time again, and tested the resolve of America. And we must be decisive in confronting this threat and humbling this tyrant,&quot; Dole added.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that Saddam Hussein is an outlaw, he's a tyrant, he's a butcher, and we cannot tolerate any further action by him in that part of the world,&quot; Dole said.</p>
<p>About 6,000 former U.S. servicemen, many of them elderly men with ribbons and medals pinned to their chests, gathered at the American Legion's annual convention to hear Dole speak.</p>
<p>The Republican candidate, severely wounded in the Second World War, received a warm reception from the crowd, which interrupted his speech a number of times.</p>
<p>The United States said earlier on Tuesday it had launched 27 cruise missiles at Iraq to punish it for attacking the Kurdish-controled town of Arbil in northern Iraq. U.S. officials later said they had launched a further 17 missiles at targets not destroyed in the first attack.</p>
<p>In a statement issued late on Tuesday, Dole reiterated his support of the U.S. troops.</p>
<p>Dole campaign spokesman Nelson Warfield said Dole assured Clinton in their five-minute telephone call on Tuesday morning that he would not make any remarks on Iraq &quot;designed to offend the president.&quot;</p>
<p>Warfield said Dole's earlier criticism of Clinton had been a &quot;historical observation&quot; on the performance of the administration, adding that it was appropriate because it was made before the first missile strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob Dole, among all people in public life, has shown his willingess, even at his own political peril, to stand by the president and our troops when a foreign policy decision is made and implemented,&quot; Warfield said.</p>
<p>In his speech, Dole repeated his plans for a 15 percent across the board tax cut and issued his standard criticisms of Clinton on a series of domestic issues, including taxes and drug use.</p>
<p>Dole later in the day made a brief stop in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to meet with a group of small business people before he flew  to Des Moines, Iowa, where he was to spend Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Wednesday he will hopscotch across the Midwest, making stops in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio. He was scheduled to return to Washington on Thursday.</p>
