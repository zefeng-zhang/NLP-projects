<p>The Finns, to date the keenest of the European Union's newcomers, have shown clear limits to their enthusiasm for tighter links with Brussels by sending their sharpest Euro-sceptics to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>In a poll with clear echoes of last week's anti-European vote in Austria and last year's roundly negative Swedish vote, those Finns who bothered to vote on Sunday gave strongest support to candidates opposed to further integration.</p>
<p>The two most outspoken EU critics came top: current Euro-MP Paavo Vayrynen, a former foreign minister and the opposition Centre Party's top Euro-sceptic, and Esko Seppanen, a rogue anti-European member of the governing Left Wing Alliance.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results, in which the Centre Party grabbed the lead with 24 percent of vote to 21 percent for the Social Democrats who head the coalition, reflected fears over a planned single currency rather than nationalist protest.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing like Austria's populist opposition vote,&quot; Pertti Pesonen of Tampere University told Reuters. &quot;Compared with Austria a week ago or Sweden a year ago, the Finns are clearly more satisfied with their European policies.&quot;</p>
<p>The vote came 22 months after Finland joined the EU with Austria and Sweden after a referendum which won 57 percent support for membership. Opinion polls before the election had pointed to a broadly unchanged picture until the final days.</p>
<p>Only then did strong support emerge for any Euro-sceptic candidates, who were capitalising on the government's decision last week to link the Finnish currency, the markka, to Europe's exchange rate mechanism -- a key step towards a single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;That gave those who wanted to appear as Euro-sceptic candidates a chance to profile themselves,&quot; said journalist and commentator Jarmo Makela. But he added: &quot;I don't think there's real Euro-scepticism in the sense that people want out of the EU.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said five or six of the 16 successful candidates elected to the European parliament could be regarded as Euro-sceptics.</p>
<p>Esko Antola, professor of European Affairs at the University of Turku, said the vote could fuel demands for the government to hold a referendum on whether to join Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which it so far has insisted parliament can decide.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a mass movement might start snowballing now -- especially if a referendum comes in another country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But, as in the Austrian and Swedish polls, the turnout by Finland's 4.1 million voters was low by Finnish standards at about 61 percent, with the young especially showing apathy.</p>
<p>Finland's distribution of seats in the Strasbourg parliament will be virtually unchanged, although support for Seppanen helped his Left Wing Alliance to snatch one seat from the Centre Party.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen conceded the results showed &quot;a certain amount of... Euroscepticism or whatever you call it,&quot; but denied it was a protest vote.</p>
<p>He said Seppanen was &quot;a well-known demagogue&quot; while Vayrynen did not play &quot;a constructive role in our politics,&quot; adding that the government would act as if EMU would definitely take off in 1999.  REUTER  202245 GMT oct 96</p>
