<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were stable to firmer on Tuesday with dealers predicting they might edge up further in coming days with only a few treasury bills maturities expected this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened Z$292 million in surplus but at the moment it's a bit short because there are not maturities. People are expecting rates to go up soon but they are still waiting for Thursday's treasury bill tender,&quot; one dealer commented.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, discount houses were taking up treasury bills at 19.73 percent and selling them at the same rate, while NCD bills maturing after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought unchanged at 22 percent but sold firmer at 21 percent from 20.</p>
<p>Bankers acceptances were buying and selling steadily at 20.50 and 20 percent respectively but call money edged up to 21 percent from 20 percent.</p>
