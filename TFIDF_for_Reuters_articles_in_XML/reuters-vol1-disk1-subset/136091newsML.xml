<headline>Ashton Technology chairman, CEO resigns.</headline>
<dateline>COLUMBIA, Md. 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ashton Technology Group Inc said Wednesday that Raymond Tate resigned as chairman, president and chief executive.</p>
<p>The company said the resignation was not related to the recent inquiry by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange into the relationship between the exchange's chairman, Vincent Casella, and Ashton's Universal Trading Technologies Corp subsidiary.</p>
<p>Tate, a founder of the company, will act as a consultant and chairman emeritus of Computer Science Innovations, another Ashton subsidiary.</p>
<p>His successor was not immediately named.  </p>
<p>Casella resigned earlier this month after questions were rasied about his ties to the company. Ashton's Universal Trading Technologies unit received a contract to build the system on the exchange's equity trading floor.</p>
<p>The exchange formed a special panel to investigate whether Casella improperly benefited from his ownership of shares in Ashton.</p>
<p>Documents submitted with federal regulators show he owned 152,000 shares of Ashton, through a company in which he was a principal, shortly before that company went public in May.</p>
