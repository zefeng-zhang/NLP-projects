<p>President Boris Yeltsin, ruling Russia from a sanatorium where he is awaiting heart surgery, on Tuesday discussed a range of issues including plans for the 1997 budget with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies said economic, social and international issues as well as the key unresolved question of next year's budget figured in discussions between the two men.</p>
<p>Parliament rejected draft 1997 spending plans last week complaining that revenue forecasts were hopelessly optimistic.</p>
<p>A special commission examining how to rake in much-needed tax arrears was to hold its first meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The VChK commission has the same initials in Russian as the Soviet-era secret police of Felix Dzerzhinsky and many Russians expect it to clamp down on tax evaders in a draconian way.</p>
<p>One official, quoted by Itar-Tass news agency, said company bosses could be held personally responsible if tax bills were not paid.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old Kremlin leader, anxious to avert political confrontation at a crucial time, on Monday asked Chernomyrdin, chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais and parliamentary chiefs to work together while he gets ready for a heart bypass operation.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot have people running in different directions and solving questions in their own ways,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. cardiologist Michael DeBakey, who is advising the Russian doctors on Yeltsin's operation, said in a newspaper interview published on Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition was improving and surgery would go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are no complications -- and I repeat, there are none right now -- the operation will take place at the end of November, during the last two weeks of the month,&quot; DeBakey told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>Yeltsin made his plea for compromise and cooperation after sacking security chief Alexander Lebed last Thursday and bringing in a moderate as secretary of the influential security council.</p>
<p>The new group, the &quot;permanent four&quot;, gives administration chief Anatoly Chubais a far bigger role in the affairs of state.</p>
<p>Lebed's sudden dismissal ignited fears that a bloody war in breakaway Chechnya might resume. Lebed was the architect of a fragile peace deal that halted 21 months of fighting there.</p>
<p>But there have been no reports of clashes in the Caucasus region and separatist leaders have indicated that they are ready to work with Lebed's successor, Ivan Rybkin.</p>
<p>Rybkin, the former speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament, also replaces the gruff ex-paratroop commander as Yeltsin's personal envoy to the southern region.</p>
<p>&quot;Rybkin and Lebed are different people but we won't link the results of the peace process with personalities,&quot; rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev told Russian television on Monday.</p>
<p>But Rybkin made clear on Tuesday that he would adopt a different style from Lebed, who won a reputation for acting first and thinking about it later.</p>
<p>&quot;I disliked cavalry attacks from childhood,&quot; Rybkin told the Vecharnaya Moskva newspaper.</p>
<p>Lebed's peace accord is deeply unpopular in the Duma, which is dominated by hardline communists and nationalists who see it as a humiliating capitulation to the rebels that will trigger the disintegration of the Russian Federation.</p>
