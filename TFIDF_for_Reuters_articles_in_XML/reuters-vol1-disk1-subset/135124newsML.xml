<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Westpac shares surge on speculation.</title>

<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Ordinary shares of Westpac Banking Corp surged nearly three percent to a high of A$6.78 as continued heavy turnover in its convertible preference shares sparked speculation a potential bidder was building a stake.</p>
<p>By 12.30 p.m. (0230 GMT), the converting preference shares were three cents up at A$8.30 on turnover of 4.16 million shares. This followed heavy turnover on Monday of 10.9 million shares. In percentage terms, nearly 19 percent of this class of security has traded so far this week.  </p>
<p>&quot;Pure speculation is pushing it up, plus you have seen some switching from other banks. It's had good support from the opening bell,&quot; said dealer Peter Struk of Reynolds and Co.</p>
<p>Other participants agreed, suggesting that traders had taken a punt on a possible bid. &quot;It's riding on the back of speculation in the papers this morning with good volume in the prefs again,&quot; said a Sydney-based dealer.</p>
<p>While speculation centred on Australia's largest bank, National Australia, as a bidder, brokers were circumspect about the likelihood of an imminent bid, saying obstacles remained.  </p>
<p>&quot;National Australia Bank has the ability (to buy Westpac) but I thought it would have a few hurdles to clear first,&quot; said broker Robert Cameron of Cameron Securities.</p>
<p>Many market players expect a rationalisation of the Australian banking industry after the Wallis inquiry into the financial system hands down its report in March next year.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Westpac said the bank had no explanation for the rise in the share price.</p>
<p>&quot;It is business as usual,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>By 1.15 p.m. (0315 GMT), Westpac ordinary shares were 14 cents higher at A$6.73 on turnover of 1.1 million shares.  </p>
<p>The converting preference shares were three cents higher at A$8.30 on turnover of 4.17 million shares.</p>
