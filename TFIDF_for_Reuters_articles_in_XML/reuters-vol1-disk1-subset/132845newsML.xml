<p>Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini is likely to announce her retirement from tennis at a news conference in New York on Thursday, local newspapers reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A joint statement from the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and representatives of Sabatini confirmed the 26-year-old would hold the conference at Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>The decision by Argentina's most successful tennis player, who has won 27 tournaments, follows a run of poor results, according to La Nacion and Clarin newspapers.</p>
<p>Clarin quoted a family member as saying &quot;there is a 99 percent chance she will leave tennis&quot;.</p>
<p>Sabatini, who began playing professional tennis in 1984, has won the U.S. Open and reached the final at Wimbledon. The former world number three now ranks 29th.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very important announcement which will have a big impact in Argentina,&quot; La Nacion quoted a Sabatini associate as saying from New York. &quot;It has to do with her future and it is a very important decision.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked by La Nacion if it had to do with her retirement, the unidentified associate said, &quot;I would have to say yes, but it is better to wait until she announces it herself.&quot;</p>
