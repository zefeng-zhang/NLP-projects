<p>Workers' representatives at Austrian fibre maker Lenzing on Monday said they would fight plans to cut 500 jobs, aimed at making the group fit for the increasingly chilly climate on the European textile market.</p>
<p>&quot;We have problems and know that something has to happen, but we are very surprised to hear about plans to cut around 500 jobs,&quot; Walter Baumgartinger, head of Lenzing's works council, was quoted by Austrian news agency APA.</p>
<p>Lenzing said earlier on Monday the job reductions were part of a plan to save up to 600 million Austrian schillings ($55.5 million) annually over the next two to three years to help it adjust to deep structural changes in the textile industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Long-term structural changes in the European textile industry -- twinned with overcapacity in Asia -- have led to extremely depressed market conditions for the global textile industry,&quot; Lenzing said in a statement.</p>
<p>Most of the savings would come from organisational changes that would not require significant investment and have no effect on production capacity, Lenzing said. The firm also saw potential to reduce energy, material and financial costs.</p>
<p>Lenzing said it would enter negotiations with the workforce immediately and forecast natural wastage would account for some, but not all of the proposed job losses. The group currently employs 3,000 staff.</p>
<p>But worker representatives said job cuts other than through natural reduction would be out of the question.</p>
<p>&quot;We can talk about not replacing natural wastage or about retraining and the like. But to reduce 500 people, that would only be possible through redundancies, and we will certainly not agree to that,&quot; Baumgartinger said.</p>
<p>Lenzing posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings in the first half of the year after a profit of 160 million last year. The firm has said it expects to remain in the red in the second half.</p>
<p>Job cuts at the textile maker, which has seen its stock slump almost 18 percent since the start of the year, would be the latest in a string of bad news that have hit the Austrian labour market over the past year and driven unemployment rates to new post-war highs.</p>
<p>Around 1,200 jobs are at stake at the southern Austrian tyre plant Semperit where the German parent Continental plans to cut production in half and move it to the neighbouring Czech Republic in an attempt to cut back on ballooning wage costs.</p>
<p>Domestic blue-chips such as national grid Verbund and steel maker Boehler-Uddeholm also have announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs to counter the Austrian economy's slowdown.</p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of the ruling Social Democrats has promised to step up a campaign for more jobs following his party's worst result in Austria's democratic historty at European Parliament elections on October 13.</p>
