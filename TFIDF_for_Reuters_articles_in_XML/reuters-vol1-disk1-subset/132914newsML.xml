<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The stock market failed to emulate Monday's record-breaking run as profit-taking, weaker futures prices and a cautious opening on Wall Street put the brakes on investor enthusiasm. The FTSE 100 share index, which on Monday touched a record 4,073.2 points, ended at 4,057.2, down 15.9 on the day.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT- German shares closed bourse trade lower, weighed down by a weaker dollar and losses on Wall Street overnight and in Tokyo. The DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade down 10.05 points at 2,718.98. In post-bourse trade the index fell 11.93 to 2,721.74.</p>
<p>PARIS - French stocks ended a touch weaker on continued but limited consolidation after a see-saw day for publishing and defence group Lagardere after positive reaction to its planned takeover of Thomson. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 4.61 points or 0.21 percent at 2,175.61.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended lower in slow trading marked by a general lack of investor interest. The all-share SPI closed 7.13 lower at 2,422.52.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended weak after wandering into negative territory throughout the session. Brokers said the market was unable to recover from poor sentiment brought about by elections on Sunday. The Nikkei 225 closed at 21,123.68, down 179.27 points.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks closed lower after a late afternoon slide that brokers described as a short bout of overdue profit-taking. The Hang Seng Index shed 65.39 points to 12,444.66 after trending sideways on robust volume during the morning session.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares were pushed to a lower close by modest selling pressure as investors cast a wary eye over Wall Street and awaited local third-quarter inflation data due on Wednesday. he All Ordinaries index lost 9.6 points to close at 2,353.6.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold shares ended a quiet day well up on a healthy bullion price and dealers expected further gains. The overall index was up 16.3 points to 7,027.8, industrials gained 7.3 points to 8,270.2, and golds were up 32.3 points to 1,708.9.</p>
