<headline>Three killed in Pakistan bomb, gun attacks.</headline>
<dateline>LAHORE, Pakistan 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>At least three people were killed and a senior government official was injured in a bomb attack and two shootouts on Tuesday in Pakistan's central province of Punjab, police said.</p>
<p>One man was killed and four others were injured by a bomb thrown at a motorcycle shop by an unidentified person in the provincial capital Lahore, a police source said.</p>
<p>But residents of the area said two people were killed by the late evening blast.</p>
<p>Earlier in southern Punjab, gunmen killed a prayer-leader in a Sunni Moslem sect mosque at Qaimpur and attacked the Shi'ite Moslem deputy commissioner of Khanewal district, Ali Raza, killing his guard and seriously injuring the official, the police said.</p>
<p>Nobody claimed responsibility for the incidents, but police said the shootouts seemed to be sectarian violence.</p>
<p>Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, has been hit in recent months by a wave of violence between rival militant groups of the majority Sunni and the minority Shi'ite sects.</p>
