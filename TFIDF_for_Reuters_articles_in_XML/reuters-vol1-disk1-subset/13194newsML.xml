<title>HONG KONG: Asian markets eye upside following recent gains.</title>
<headline>Asian markets eye upside following recent gains.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-08-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most Asian markets were expected to climb further this week as Hong Kong eyes the upside following gains over the past week and Tokyo looks for support from the release of a key business sentiment survey.</p>
<p>A modest drop on Wall Street, where the Dow closed down 11 points at 5,723 on Friday, was not seen weighing heavily on sentiment, although weakness in the U.S. bond market could be a factor. Risks to the downside were seen in Manila after a spectacular rise of nearly four percent over the past week, while caution was seen the rule in Singapore and Jakarta and more selling is expected to hit Seoul and Bangkok, brokers said.</p>
<p>		    - - - - JAPAN - - - -</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks were seen trapped in a tight range with investors sidelined at least until Wednesday when the Bank of Japan releases its key &quot;tankan&quot; business sentiment survey.</p>
<p>Brokers said the data, which analysts expect will not prompt the central bank to raise its interest rates, could lend the market some support.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei 225 average ended four days of straight gains on Friday, finishing at 21,228.80, down 0.63 percent from Thursday but up 1.89 percent on the week.</p>
<p>		    - - - - HONG KONG - - - -</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks were expected to retain a firm tone after rallying through major resistance this past week, but some consolidation was likely, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall I think in terms of interest rates in the (United) States and China, things are looking brighter and we have come up above the 11,300 level which has really been a heavy barrier on the market,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities. &quot;I think we could see a good week. We could see some consolidation around 11,400 to 11,600,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index ended Friday at 11,424.64, up 2.22 percent on the week. The market will be closed on Monday.</p>
<p>		    - - - - AUSTRALIA - - - -</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A firmer Australian bourse on Friday was seen setting shares up for more gains as investor confidence grows due to the prospect of lower interest rates and a firmer Wall Street in the lead up to the U.S presidential election.</p>
<p>&quot;This (election) factor combined with Thursday's rate cut in Germany appears to have injected some confidence into the U.S. market which should rub off here,&quot; said Jim Tredenick, a dealer at Brisbane broker, Nevitts.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries index finished at 2,292.9, up 66.2 points or three percent over the week.</p>
<p>		    - - - - BANGLADESH - - - -</p>
<p>DHAKA - Bangladesh's market may rise further on hopes that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's pledge to relax investment rules will attract investment, analysts said.</p>
<p>The analysts said the market was very stable and solid and doubted it would experience wild swings in the near future.</p>
<p>Hasina on Thursday told a meeting of American-Bangladesh Investors' Forum her government would simplify rules and open up power and telecommunications sectors for private investment.</p>
<p>The Dhaka Stock Exchange all-share price index gained 28.35 points or 2.51 percent in the week to 1,156.79.</p>
<p>		    - - - - INDIA - - - -</p>
<p>BOMBAY - Indian stocks were likely to gain slightly this week but the recovery was expected to be short-lived, with investors looking to book profits at higher levels, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bombay shares have fallen over 10 percent since India released its budget last month.</p>
<p>Blue chips rebounded slightly this week but one trader said that &quot;it seems to be just a relief rally and people are bound to exit at slightly higher levels&quot;.</p>
<p>In the week to Friday, the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index rose 48.65 points or 1.4 percent to 3431.40.</p>
<p>		    - - - - INDONESIA - - - -</p>
<p>JAKARTA - Indonesian shares were seen mixed following an easing on political tensions which dealers said should entice more local investors into the market while keeping some foreigners sidelined pending further developments.</p>
<p>&quot;Lower political tension lent a positive tone to the market but the market continues to take a prudent approach by buying selectively,&quot; said Budiyanto Wijaya, broker at DBS Securities Indonesia.</p>
<p>Jakarta's composite index ended the week at 549.21 points, up 2.3 percent from the previous week.</p>
<p>		    - - - - NEW ZEALAND - - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - New Zealand shares were seen rising further after one of the market's strongest weeks in a year despite a looming general election and an opinion poll on Friday that was negative for the conservative National Party government.</p>
<p>&quot;The market doesn't seem worried about the prospect of the October 12 election,&quot; Cavill White's Don Turkington said. &quot;There could be a correction, but I don't think you will see it upsetting the uptrend.&quot;</p>
<p>The market surged 3.3 percent over the week to close Friday at a 2-1/2 year high of 2,222.59. Bellwether share, Telecom, hit a record high in the week, breaking significant chart points.</p>
<p>		    - - - - PAKISTAN - - - -</p>
<p>KARACHI - Pakistani stocks, which rebounded on covering of short positions on Thursday, were likely to continue the rally on buying of blue chips by investors in the next trading session after the Friday-Saturday weekend.</p>
<p>Market investors were awaiting a fundamental improvement rather than a correction in the week ahead, one dealer Ali Hussain Rajabali said.</p>
<p>The Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share price index ended its trading week on Thursday at 1,449.55, down 0.54 percent on the previous week.</p>
<p>		    - - - - PHILIPPINES - - - -</p>
<p>MANILA - Manila shares were seen facing some profit-taking as the market consolidates following a week-on-week rise of 3.8 percent, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market surged in the last two days this week, with the index rising by 2.45 percent on Thursday and by 1.21 percent on Friday to end the week at 3,226.46 points.</p>
<p>Noel Reyes, research head of Anscor Hagedorn Securities, said he expected profit-taking early in the week. &quot;But by the second day (of the week) or midweek, there will be fresh positioning on GNP,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The country's second quarter gross national product figures are expected to be released towards the end of the month.</p>
<p>		    - - - - SINGAPORE - - - -</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Share prices were likely to open cautiously when trading begins this week as investors focus on speculative stocks and potential takeover plays, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think speculative stocks are likely to dominate the market volume,&quot; John Yap, Kay Hian James Capel director said.</p>
<p>The market was seen positive in the early part of the week with profit taking settling in later in the week, brokers said.</p>
<p>Fund managers are likely to remain quiet in the absence of fresh leads, they added. The key 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index closed at 2,181.52 on Friday, up 3.86 percent on the week.</p>
<p>		    - - - - SOUTH KOREA - - - -</p>
<p>SEOUL - South Korean stocks were expected to slide and possibly to test support at the 760 level, weighed down by fears of rising interest rates and jitters over the weakening economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The composite index is likely to fall to as low as 760 next week,&quot; said Yoo Jae-kyong of Daishin Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers cited fears of rising interest rates ahead of the Korean Thanksgiving holidays in September.</p>
<p>The composite index ended at 781.42 on Friday, down 4.1 percent from a week earlier.</p>
<p>		    - - - - TAIWAN - - - -</p>
<p>TAIPEI - Share prices were expected to rise after the central bank lowered its reserve requirements for local banks by up to 0.5 percentage point, effective on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We should soon see gains in financial and construction shares. No matter how much the cut will help the economy, the stock market will benefit first,&quot; said Geo</p>
