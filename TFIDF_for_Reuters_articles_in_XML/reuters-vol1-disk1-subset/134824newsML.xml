<p>Danish shipbuilders, hit by competition from subsidised yards abroad, suffered a legal defeat on Tuesday when their challenge to EU approval of aid to a rival east German shipbuilder was rejected.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg-based European Court of First Instance dismissed an appeal brought by the Danish Shipbuilders' Association against a European Commission decision to clear state aid to shipyard Meerestechnik Werft Wismar (MTW).</p>
<p>Despite the ruling, Danish shipbuilders vowed to continue their fight against German government aid.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to study the text of the ruling in detail, there is a lot in it which we can use in our ongoing battle against state subsidies in the shipbuilding industry,&quot; Thorkild Christensen, head of the Danish Shipbuilders' Association, told the Ritzaus news agency in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The Danish Shipbuilders' Association had challenged the Commission's 1994 decision to authorise a second tranche of state aid totalling 406 million marks ($265 million) to the German yard, which at the time belonged to the now bankrupt Bremer Vulkan.</p>
<p>In December 1992, the Commission cleared the payment of a first tranche of operating aid, amounting to 191.2 million marks, to help MTW modernise and reduce capacity.</p>
<p>The Shipbuilders' Association, supported by the Danish government, wanted the Commission's decision to clear the second tranche of aid to be annulled &quot;in part or in its entirety.&quot;</p>
<p>It argued among other things that the Commission had no competence to approve the support and that the authorised aid exceeded the limit allowed under EU rules.</p>
<p>Danish shipbuilders have long complained about subsidies in competing nations, notably Germany. They have also been affected by the rise of South Korea as a major low-cost shipbuilding power and the strength of the Danish crown.</p>
<p>The 152-year-old Burmeister &amp; Wain (B&amp;W) yard closed down last April after a 10-month fight to stave off bankruptcy and other yards are also in trouble.</p>
<p>The German yard, now named MTW Schiffswerft, belongs to the German state following this year's collapse of Bremer Vulkan.</p>
<p>Bremer Vulkan, which snapped up eastern yards after German unification in 1990, agreed in March to sell off MTW and its other eastern German subsidiary Volkswerft in Stralsund for a symbolic one mark.</p>
<p>Bremer Vulkan has been accused of having misused 716 million marks in subsidies designated to refurbish run-down eastern yards, including MTW, to cover losses at other units.</p>
<p>EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has vowed to help salvage MTW and Volkswerft whose dire financial situation results partly from the appropriation by their former parent company of funds intended to them.</p>
<p>The European Commission has yet to determine how much of the approved aid actually went to MTW.</p>
<p>The Commission, which vets state aid in the 15-nation EU to check whether it may harm competition, in April approved a 48-million-mark subsidy for MTW, a move made possible by its separation from Bremer Vulkan. The subsidy was part of the investment aid agreed in 1992.</p>
<p>An EU source said the German government had recently notified the Commission that it wanted to &quot;reconstitute&quot; the aid to the two shipyards that had been lost when they belonged to Bremer Vulkan.</p>
<p>Tuesday's court verdict would &quot;no doubt facilitate the (Commission's) examination of new aid that is proposed for those yards,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
