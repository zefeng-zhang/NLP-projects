<p>Warring Afghan factions claimed military gains against each other on Tuesday, but there was little sign of the front-line moving either way on the plains north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Fighters of the purist Taleban militia, which took Kabul in late September and controls three-quarters of the country, said they traded heavy rocket and artillery fire with forces of Ahmad Shah Masood, military chief in the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.</p>
<p>The Taleban said they had driven Masood forces from villages west of Hussein Kot, 18 km (14 miles) north of Kabul, and captured 150 prisoners.</p>
<p>Fighting continued on Tuesday despite efforts by Pakistan to broker a ceasefire between the factions, which have been battling for the past week for control of a swathe of plain 30 minutes' drive north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Masood forces said they had taken hills west of the Khair Khana pass which leads into the capital, but there was no sign of fighting there when reporters travelled through the pass on Tuesday morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>Reuters correspondent Chris Bird reported from Masood's lines that shellfire raised columns of dust on the hills around Khair Khana, while heavy machine-gun fire echoed around the mountains.</p>
<p>&quot;We have orders to move forward and take the pass,&quot; Masood commander Sabir told him.</p>
<p>Witnesses saw plumes of smoke rising from the village of Kareez Mir, west of the road to Kabul and some 10 km (seven miles) from the city's edge.</p>
<p>Taleban fighters who had been rocketing the village said they had dislodged Masood commander Mullah Taj Mohammad from the area earlier in the day.</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of the claim.</p>
<p>Pakistan, which has denied accusations it backs the Taleban, said it was still hopeful for a ceasefire despite veiled criticism from U.N. Afghan envoy Norbert Holl and differing conditions set by both sides.</p>
<p>The Taleban have demanded an exchange of prisoners while Masood wants Kabul demilitarised.</p>
<p>&quot;I am more than hopeful (for a ceasefire accord) because in principle they have all agreed,&quot; Pakistani Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar told a news conference in Islamabad. &quot;The ceasefire will be applicable all across Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he expected a positive response by Wednesday from the man he said had first proposed the ceasefire, Dostum,.</p>
<p>On the main road leading north from Kabul, the front-line appeared little changed since Monday. Some Taleban fighters said they had advanced several kilometres (miles) but their main command post was in the same position.</p>
<p>They said the two sides had exchanged rocket and tank fire for an hour earlier in the day but at mid-afternoon the situation was quiet.</p>
<p>On a parallel road further east, however, witnesses said Taleban positions were about two kilometres (one mile) further north than on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council was expected to adopt a resolution calling for a ceasefire and political negotiations on Tuesday, while Holl continued his efforts with a trip to the far north to try to get warring factions to agree.</p>
<p>Doubt about where the front-line is on maps has led to confusion over whether Hussein Kot was in the hands of Masood or the Taleban.</p>
<p>Some local people said the name applied to a string of villages on the road, parts of which may be held by each side.</p>
<p>Refugees continued to escape to Kabul, some forcing an overloaded truck on the main road to stop and clambering aboard in a near panic. One woman later fell off.</p>
<p>But later in the day the situation appeared calmer, with some traffic travelling both ways along the road.</p>
<p>Masood, formally allied to northern Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum, has in the past 10 days reversed a Taleban offensive on his Panjsher Valley stronghold and taken positions within rocket range of the city, including Bagram military airbase.</p>
<p>The Taleban have been reinforced by an influx of fighters from other provinces.</p>
<p>The planned U.N. resolution, drafted by Russia, calls for states to refrain from interfering in the conflict and stop supplying arms to factions.</p>
<p>It also calls on U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros- Ghali and his envoys to cooperate with interested states and organisations to promote a political dialogue.</p>
<p>Afghan watchers say Pakistan's effort is hamstrung by suspicion -- despite its denials -- that it is partisan and seeking to isolate Masood by reaching an understanding with his newfound ally Dostum.</p>
