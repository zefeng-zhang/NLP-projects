<headline>Argentine stocks close shade lower, seen listless.</headline>

<p>Argentine stocks recorded slim losses at the close Wednesday as players took some profits and marked time ahead of the week's two final key sessions, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very little action,&quot; said analyst Roberto Diaz at Provincia Bursatil brokers. &quot;Two issues which loom are tomorrow's meeting (of Peronist leaders) with President Carlos Menem and Friday's U.S. jobs report.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index shed 0.4 percent to end at 516.53, while floor turnover remained threadlike at 12.5 million pesos against 12 million Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Menem huddles at the Olivos presidential residence Thursday with top Peronists in a summit analysts say should help the ruling party iron out differences over economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Menem will do all the talking,&quot; Diaz said, hinting the president would lobby for consensus and make it very clear he expects party lawmakers and governors to back the government's recent tax package and imminent labor reforms.</p>
<p>Traders said U.S. brokers Bear Stearns' decision early Tuesday to cut Argentina to underweight from neutral in their portfolio hurt the bolsa's recent recovery.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Bear Stearns report was a blow, but the fall was restrained by news the government has backpedalled on its plans to raise personal wealth tax (which includes stock and bond holdings),&quot; said Humberto Lopez at Wainbuch brokers.</p>
<p>The government is mulling a raise in income tax instead, and while this scenario together with recent Argentine international bond issues will favor fixed income markets, it may have a negative effect on the bolsa, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies will have to pay more income tax and so pressure will be greater on stocks,&quot; said Lopez. &quot;We may see a period of stronger bonds and weaker stocks.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the session broad market issues matched MerVal losses of 0.4 percent, while losers and winners were even at 20 and 22 issues closed unchanged.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter deals slowed to 57.4 million pesos from 75.9 million Tuesday.</p>
<p>Heaviest main-tier losses were in pulp maker Celulosa, petrochemical concern Indupa and sugar refiner Ledesma, which fell 4.8 percent, 2.3 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Top gainers were holding firm Garovaglio and construction stock Juan Minetti, up 3.0 percent and 2.9 percent each.</p>
