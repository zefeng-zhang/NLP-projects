<headline>S&amp;P cuts CP ratings of BTR Plc to A1.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Tuesday it had lowered its commercial paper ratings of BTR Plc and related entities to A1 from A1 plus and removed them from creditwatch.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said the ratings were placed on creditwatch on September 13, 1996, following the release of 1996 interim results which showed a net loss of 36 million stg (around $54 million) after very large exceptional provisions of 622 million stg (before tax relief) relating to a major restructuring programme.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rating downgrade reflects the very competitive nature of most business areas in which newly refocused BTR companies operate, which will make their stated objectives of revenue and profit growth difficult to achieve,&quot; S&amp;P said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;BTR has just committed itself to a major programme of rationalisation in an effort to bring 32 previously almost autonomous units together into seven business groups.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While the process of radical change inside BTR is a logical response to changing industry conditions, it will take some time before the fruits of this reorganisation become apparent,&quot; S&amp;P said.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said in the near term, group margins might come under pressure and the company had made it clear that acquisitions were also possible, although S&amp;P believed that any such acquisitions would be to enhance existing business positions rather than to expand into unrelated areas.</p>
<p>&quot;BTR's ratings still reflect their strong credit profile underpinned by strong business positions in competitive industries, a good geographical and end user balance of earnings and a robust financial profile,&quot; the rating agency said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said the following ratings had been lowered and removed from creditwatch.  </p>
