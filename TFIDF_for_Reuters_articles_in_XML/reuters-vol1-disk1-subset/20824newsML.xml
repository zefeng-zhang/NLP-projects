<p>Germany's largest industrial conglomorate, Daimler-Benz AG, took its first step toward lasting profits on Thursday, announcing a rebound in first half earnings after record high losses last year.</p>
<p>Daimler, much criticised for last year's 5.7 billion mark loss, said net profits in the first six months of the 1996 climbed to 782 million marks from a 1.6 billion mark loss for first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference, management board chairman Juergen Schrempp said first-half sales climbed 1.3 percent to 49.07 billion marks as operating profit swung to a 827 million mark profit from a 613 million mark loss.</p>
<p>For the second half of 1996 Daimler said it expects a ongoing positive developments, but Schrempp said further work was needed to increase profits.</p>
<p>&quot;So let there be no mistake. We have only just begun,&quot; Schrempp said. &quot;Our goal remains that each business unit will achieve a return that is among the top of the world class companies in each sector where we compete.&quot;</p>
<p>Schrempp hinted the results may enable the company the pay a dividend this year after not paying a dividend in 1995. &quot;We will go back to discuss dividends,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The net profit result was near the high end of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>The profit figures were exclusively made according to U.S. GAAP accounting rules for the first time in Daimler's history, in a move designed to make the company more appealing to international investors.</p>
<p>The profit rise was led by the group's flagship unit, car and truck maker Mercedes-Benz AG. Mercedes, benefitting from a stronger dollar and booming sales of its E-Class model posted an 2.8 percent rise in operating profit to 1.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;Mercedes is now the most profitable automobile manufacturer in the world on a per unit basis and we intend to keep it that way,&quot; Schrempp said.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA), in the midst of a massive cost cutting campaign, showed an operating loss of 677 million marks.</p>
<p>This loss is smaller than the first-half 1995 operating loss of 1.62 billion marks however.</p>
<p>Schrempp restated his belief that DASA will reach the break- even point by 1998, saying he was encouraged by overall growth in the global aircraft industry and a record inflow of Airbus orders. DASA is a major partner in the Airbus Industrie consortium.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis), the financial and services division, saw operating profits climb to 212 million marks from 156 million marks in the year earlier period.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest conglomorate, was pushed deep into the red last year as it undertook a massive reorganisation aimed to returning to its transporation roots, abandoning dreams to become an integrated technology company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Daimler shares, which had been climbing in anticipation of strong numbers over the last few days, slipped seven pfennigs to 81.25 marks on profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>In 1995, Daimler took one-off charges of 3.9 billion marks including a 2.3 billion mark write down of Dutch aircraft maker Fokker NV and 1.6 billion marks for streamlining of its AEG unit.</p>
<p>Schrempp said Daimler had cut the number of business units in the group's portfolio to 25 from 35 since last May. &quot;The earnings potential for the steamlined portfolio has increased substantially,&quot; he said.</p>
