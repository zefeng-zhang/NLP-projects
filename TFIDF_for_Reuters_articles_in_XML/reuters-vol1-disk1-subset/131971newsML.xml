<title>SINGAPORE: Bankers Trust to manage funds in Singapore.</title>

<p>Bankers Trust has opened a Singapore fund management office managing a S$500 million (US$354.6 million) account for Southeast Asia, the company said on Monday.</p>
<p>Ian Martin, Bankers Trust's global head of investment management, told a press conference that Bankers Trust Funds Management (Singapore) (BTFMS) would play &quot;a pivotal role in our investment management process&quot;.</p>
<p>The S$500 million portfolio is about 40 per cent of the group's Southeast Asian portfolio, excluding Japan, and was previously managed out of Sydney.</p>
<p>&quot;It is assuming responsibility within the group for investing S$500 million, of which S$400 million is sourced from foreign investors and a further S$100 million is sourced from local investors,&quot; said Martin.</p>
<p>Liberalisation, deregulation, prospects for retail fund management growth and Singapore's role as a regional financial centre were key reasons for the Singapore office, he said.  </p>
<p>The prospect of managing funds from Singapore's Central Provident Fund (CPF) was also among the attractions.</p>
<p>&quot;We see great opportunities in Singapore's funds management business,&quot; said BTFMS managing director and chief executive officer Lee Tiong Seng.</p>
<p>Bankers Trust had begun talks with the authorities but there had been no formal submission on the CPF issue, he said.</p>
<p>Among the issues being discussed was the requirement of a three-year track record for fund management companies in Singapore before they can manage CPF funds.</p>
<p>BTFMS was &quot;hopeful of a successful outcome&quot;, said Lee.</p>
