<p>Most supporters of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Repubican Army (IRA), want the guerrillas to call a new truce in their battle against British rule of Northern Ireland, an opinion poll said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Irish News, published in Belfast, said a survey taken two weeks after the IRA killed a British soldier in its first bombing in the province for two years showed that more than seven out of 10 Sinn Fein supporters backed a ceasefire.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,038 people showed &quot;considerable pessimism among all sections of the community over the short-term prospects for peace,&quot; the newspaper said in a statement.</p>
<p>The survey found that 94 percent of Northern Ireland's people -- 98 percent of the Protestants and 89 percent of the Catholics -- wanted an end to IRA violence.</p>
<p>&quot;When Sinn Fein supporters were asked if they wanted an immediate ceasefire, 71 per cent said yes and 28 per cent said no,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>Respondents across the sectarian divide were pessimistic about the prospects that multi-party peace talks, which have made plodding progress since June, would be successful.</p>
<p>Asked if the talks, chaired by former U.S.senator George Mitchell, would reach a settlement acceptable to both Catholic Irish republicans and pro-British Protestants, 61 per cent said this was fairly, or very, unlikely. Only three percent thought it was very likely.</p>
<p>The IRA declared a ceasefire in September 1994 but abandoned it last February, accusing Britain of reneging on a guarantee that Sinn Fein could take part in the all-party talks.</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland insist that the IRA must call off hostilities before Sinn Fein can be admitted to the talks.</p>
