<p>Keith Tkachuk of the Phoenix Coyotes scored three goals and added an assist as the United States routed Slovakia 9-3 Tuesday for a perfect 3-0 record in the opening round of ice hockey's World Cup.</p>
<p>The Americans had already clinched first place in the North American pool and now have a bye until Sunday when they play the winner of Friday's Russia-Finland game. Slovakia was playing for pride, having already been eliminated, and finished with a 0-3 record.</p>
<p>The United States used backup goalie Guy Hebert of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, resting the New York Rangers' Mike Richter, and still won easily, getting three goals in each period.</p>
<p>Slovakia scored first, the Washington Capitals' Peter Bondra hitting on a power play at 2:15 of the first period when he slammed home a 20-footer from the circle.</p>
<p>The United States came back with five unanswered goals, three of them in the first period. Tkachuk took a a pass out from the St Louis Blues' Brett Hull and beat Slovakia's young goalie Roman Mega from in close at 5:50.</p>
<p>Doug Weight of the Edmonton Oilers took a lead pass from the Philadelphia Flyers' Jack Leclair and tapped in a five-footer at 7:13 and Leclair scored himself at 13:34, cashing the rebound of a shot by the Chicago Blackhawks' Tony Amonte with Mega far out of his goal.</p>
<p>In the second period Leclair passed to Tkachuk on a rush and he scored with a 30-footer at 10:16. The Toronto Maple Leafs' Matthieu Schneider completed a two-on-one rush at 12:37 to make it 5-1.</p>
<p>Before the end of the second period Tkachuk completed his three-goal hat trick at 18:20 after Slovakia managed a goal at 16:09 when Slavomir Llavsky beat Hebert with a high, arching 10-foot rebound.</p>
<p>The three-goals-to-one ratio held in the final period with Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars getting two U.S. goals and Joel Otto of the Philadelphia Flyers the third goal. Lubomir Rybovic scored for Slovakia to make the final 9-3 count.</p>
<p>Dan Wilson, the U.S. coach said: &quot;The play was very fast and it was a skill game. We have more depth than they do, and we cashed our chances. They did not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are coming together at the right time,&quot; said Hull. &quot;Either Finland or Russia is a tough opponent, but we are playing with great determination.&quot;</p>
<p>Said Bondra: &quot;We are happy to represent Slovakia since the change with the Czech Republic. We wanted to see how close we have come to the big countries. We lost a close game to Canada (3-2) but tonight we gave them too many chances in front of our net.&quot;</p>
<p>Slovakia's head coach, Jozef Golonka was disappointed. &quot;Our players were mentally down because after yesterday when the U.S. beat Russia we knew we were eliminated. We played well in the other two games, but not tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday, Germany (1-2) meets Canada (2-1) in a single-elimination contest at Montreal. Finland (2-1) meets Russia (1-2) at Ottawa Friday.</p>
<p>On Saturday in Philadelphia, Sweden (3-0), the winner of the European pool, meets the Canada-Germany winner a day before the United States' game in Ottawa against the Russia-Finland winner.</p>
