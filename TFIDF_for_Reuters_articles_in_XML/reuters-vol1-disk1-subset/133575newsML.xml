<p>Kurdish militia leader Jalal Talabani met a U.S. mediator in the Turkish capital on Tuesday for talks on ending infighting in north Iraq that has hurt Washington's anti-Baghdad efforts.</p>
<p>Peace envoy Robert Pelletreau shook hands with Talabani before going into talks at a U.S. diplomat's house in Ankara's posh Cankaya district.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said Pelletreau would try to convince Talabani to accept a ceasefire proposal also put to rival Iraqi Kurd leader Massoud Barzani.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, who met Talabani ahead of his talks with Pelletreau, said she expected an imminent end to the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;Both Talabani and Barzani had very positive views on securing a ceasefire,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;We hope a ceasefire will be achieved soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Washington, which has kept Iraqi President Saddam Hussein out of north Iraq for most of the last five years, fears Baghdad or Tehran might fill a power vacuum caused by the Kurdish feud.</p>
<p>But Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on Tuesday called on the Kurds to settle their differences under Baghdad's auspices.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing at this time is to end fighting and prevent foreign intervention whether from the Iranian side or American and then procede toward dialogue in Baghdad between the two (Kurdish) sides,&quot; the official Iraqi News Agency INA quoted Aziz as saying.</p>
<p>He blamed the United States for the Kurdish clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;America is fully responsible for the destruction and explosions in the Kurdish autonomous region because it is only serving its own interests,&quot; Aziz said.</p>
<p>The West encouraged the Kurds to break from Baghdad in 1991 but has been powerless to resolve a Kurdish power struggle that has since split the mountainous region between the two warlords.</p>
<p>An outbreak of fighting in August forced Washington to ditch aid, military and intelligence programmes in the north after Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) fighters joined with Iraqi troops to take the regional capital Arbil.</p>
<p>The U.S. peace bid has yet to produce a let-up in fighting.</p>
<p>Barzani's forces prepared defensive positions on a hill in northern Iraq on Tuesday in readiness for a counter attack towards Arbil by Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
<p>KDP fighters set up mortar and machinegun posts on the 500-metre (1,500-feet) Heibet Sultan hill.</p>
<p>The PUK beat off a KDP attack on the strategic Dukan Dam on Monday. Some of Barzani's fighters, looking weary, were walking the 35-km (20-mile) back to the hill from Dukan.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of deaths at Dukan, including civilians,&quot; local KDP commander Hassan Balamarani told Reuters. He did not say how many people had been killed.</p>
<p>The KDP says Iranian troops and munitions have poured across the border into Talabani-held territory in recent weeks. Tehran and the PUK deny military cooperation.</p>
<p>Kurdish officials in Arbil said U.N. representatives in the region had spoken to both factions and arranged for a temporary truce along the road between the key PUK city of Sulaimaniya and Koi Sanjak, south of Arbil, to allow an aid convoy to travel there on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But PUK commander Kosrat Rasoul -- a former prime minister of a joint Kurdish administration -- was pessimistic. &quot;I'm not hopeful for a ceasefire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pelletreau laid out a ceasefire plan at a meeting with Barzani in the Turkish border town of Silopi on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;(Barzani) was positive on the ceasefire. Very positive,&quot; a source close to the talks told Reuters.</p>
