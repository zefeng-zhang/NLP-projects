<p>Nine Nigerian airforce officers were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to 50 years for embezzling 63 million naira ($787,500) of public funds, state radio reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A court martial sentenced the officers from the airforce finance unit on Monday, ending the trial that began in July on more than a dozen counts of corruption.</p>
<p>Among the nine, wing commander Leo James faces 50 years in prison and the former head of the finance unit, group captain Raymond Tinglocha is to serve 49 years.</p>
<p>They were accused of systematically stealing airforce funds and were ordered to refund a total 167.7 million naira ($2 million) to the government.</p>
<p>&quot;They are a clique of hard, merciless criminals who nearly brought the Nigeria Airforce to its knees,&quot; said court martial president air commodore Victor Akiti.</p>
<p>&quot;While the nation and the airforce were in gross neglect as a result of lack of funds, these officers were dancing in obscene wealth,&quot; Akiti added while passing judgment.</p>
<p>Nigeria's military government has said it would pass a decree to bring to book hundreds of current and former officials found to have stolen from public enterprises.</p>
