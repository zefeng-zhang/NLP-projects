<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul stocks close lower in consolidation.</title>
<headline>Seoul stocks close lower in consolidation.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stocks closed lower on Tuesday in what brokers said is a consolidation following the last week's rises.</p>
<p>Brokers said the high level of margin loans at brokerage houses was also a factor affecting the general sentiment.</p>
<p>The composite index provisionally ended at 819.22, down 1.61 percent or 13.40 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Selling was broad-based, even though trading volume was very low,&quot; said Noh Byoung-keuk of Coryo Securities.</p>
<p>Volume totalled 26.05 million shares, down from 34.72 million on Monday.  </p>
<p>Margin loans which investors owed to brokerage firms stood at around 2.9 trillion won as of Monday, outpacing customer deposits estimated at around 2.8 trillion, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Recently investors increased buying on margin loans in anticipation of rising customer deposits. But deposit growth was much slower than they expected and investors are now selling to repay loans,&quot; said Yoo Jae-kyong of Daishin Securities.</p>
<p>Declining stocks beat advancers by 782 to 163.</p>
<p>Brokers said an unexpected sharp rise in bond yields also took its toll on the overall sentiment.  </p>
<p>Bond market dealers said yields on the benchmark three-year corporate bonds rose 16 basis points to 12.10 percent on Tuesday on market talk that next month's supply would be more than previously expected.</p>
<p>Brokers said hopes for a steady decline in the interest rates had been behind the recent strength of the stock market.</p>
<p>The index futures December contracts ended 1.1 points lower at 86.10 and the KOSPI-200 index fell 1.34 points to 85.96.</p>
