<p>Mining giant RTZ-CRA on Thursday said it wanted its Australian mines to raise productivity to meet coal demand from Asian power stations. (Corrects from &quot;...it wanted its Australian miners to work harder for the same wages to meet increased coal demand...&quot;)</p>
<p>Predicting a six percent rise in world demand for steam coal in the next 10 years, RTZ-CRA deputy chief executive Leon Davis pointed at a discrepancy between low productivity in Australia compared with the U.S.</p>
<p>To boost efficiency at the seven Australian mines, &quot;we need to work our assets 24 hours a day and seven days week, while people will have to work eight hours a day,&quot; Davis told a meeting of mining analysts.</p>
<p>Although industrial relations in Australia were already allowing for more competitive working practices, Davis said there was still &quot;a lot of folklore we have to get away with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have to make the assets sweat a bit more, giving good work practices.. (which) will all contribute to quite massive production improvements,&quot; he said, adding relations in the coal industry had remained more rigid than in other sectors of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>Asked whether RTZ-CRA, the world's biggest mining firm, would be prepared to raise salaries to win workers' support, Davis said: &quot;I don't think money is at the heart of this.&quot;</p>
<p>Anglo-Australian RTZ-CRA, created through a merger in December 1995, accounts for roughly three percent of world coal production.</p>
<p>The group aims to double coal production in the U.S. by the year 2005 and sees potential to do the same in Australia, not only by improving efficiency, but mainly by starting new mines.</p>
<p>Coal production in Australia, which is largely aimed for exports to Asia, currently is a maximum 29,000 tonnes per employee per year.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, the equivalent figure for the U.S., where RTZ has five coal mining operations, is nearly 100,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Davis said he expected the coal market environment in the U.S. to remain competitive, while seeing scope for price rises in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;The spot price has shown some strength, so we may be in a position to negotiate higher prices next year,&quot; Davis said of the European market.</p>
<p>But the general market outlook was brightest in the Far East and the Indian subcontinent. &quot;Asia will drive demand,&quot; said Davis, adding this will be the result of strongly growing economies in countries such as Korea, Taiwan, China and India.</p>
<p>&quot;Coal is at an historic watershed. There is an urgent need for cheap and reliable energy,&quot; said Davis.</p>
<p>Coal made up about 13 percent of RTZ-CRA's first-half earnings, which were reported in September and showed a 22 percent drop to $552 million (corrects from $522 million).</p>
