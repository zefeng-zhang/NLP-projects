<p>Defender Sergei Timofeyev, who plays for Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz, has been banned for 10 games for breaking an opponent's cheekbone with his elbow.</p>
<p>Timofeyev was originally suspended for an unlimited period after he elbowed Lokomotiv Moscow's Andrei Solomatin during a 0-0 draw in September.</p>
<p>A Russian soccer official said on Wednesday the league's disciplinary committee had decided to limit the punishment to a 10-game ban after hearing evidence that Solomatin was recovering faster than expected.</p>
<p>Timofeyev, who has already been sidelined for three games, will miss the vital final two games of the season and the first five matches of the next term.</p>
<p>Alania's chances of retaining the championship suffered a big blow earlier this month when international defender Omari Tetradze was suspended for the rest of the season for pushing a linesman during a 2-0 away defeat by CSKA Moscow.</p>
<p>Alania, who have always had a reputation for physical play, are on 66 points with two games of the season left. Above them are Rotor Volgograd with 67 and Spartak Moscow on 68.</p>
