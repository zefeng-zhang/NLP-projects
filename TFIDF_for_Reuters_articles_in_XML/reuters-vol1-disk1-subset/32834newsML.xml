<p>(1) &quot;Same store sales&quot; for Penn Traffic's supermarkets decreased 3.6% during the second quarter.  Prior year revenues include $11.3 million generated by 11 of Penn's former general merchandise stores (Harts) and two former Acme stores, all of which were closed after the second quarter of Fiscal 1996. At August 3, 1996, Penn operated 267 supermarkets with total square footage of 10,667,000 square feet.</p>
<p>(2) Certain costs approximating $1.9 million and $3.7 million were included in cost of sales for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 and for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 1995, respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 and the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 1996.</p>
<p>(3) During the second quarter of Fiscal 1996, Penn recorded certain expenses totaling $65.2 million ($51.9 million net of tax benefit) classified as an unusual item. This unusual item was related to the closure of the stand alone general merchandise business (Harts), the write-off of equipment which the Company determined would no longer be utilized in its business, costs incurred in connection with Penn's expense reduction program and an increase in its closed store reserve.</p>
