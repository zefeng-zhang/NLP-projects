<headline>N.Y. Assembly sends most budget bills to governor.</headline>

<p>More than eight weeks after New York state approved its budget, the Assembly submitted to Gov. George Pataki the last major bills, including workers' compensation, which he sees as a capstone of the session.</p>
<p>&quot;This is virtually everything, if not everything,&quot; said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor.</p>
<p>In addition to the workers' compensation reforms, which are expected to save employers as much as $1.3 billion, or 25 percent, of the program's yearly costs, the Assembly submitted two other key items, a legislative source said.</p>
<p>The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two other bills dealt with managed care and the New York Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Methodology system, which has set hospital rates for all payers since 1983.</p>
<p>As part of the $66 billion budget that was not agreed until 104 days after it was due, a new national record for late budgets, New York's governor and legislators agreed to a plan to move to negotiated rates for most payers.</p>
<p>The new system, designed to lower costs by increasing competition, goes into effect beginning on January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>Part of the new managed care legislative will authorize New York state to shift more than two million patients from Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that pays health care costs for the indigent, to health maintenance organizations.</p>
<p>While the state still must obtain approval from the federal government before it can require Medicaid patients to enroll in managed care, officials are confident they will get the go-ahead in the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in the final stages of addressing their concerns and conditions. We expect to go forward with a mandatory plan for most of the Medicaid population starting the first of the year,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the state Health Department.</p>
<p>She could not estimate how much the state will save by requiring Medicaid patients to use health maintenance organizations, adding New York also expects the health maintenance organizations to provide better healthcare.</p>
<p>The bill will let the state set up special managed care programs for Medicaid patients who are infected with the HIV virus or suffer from mental illnesses.</p>
<p>Approximately 650,000 of the state's Medicaid patients already have voluntarily joined managed care programs.</p>
<p>Other managed care legislative aims to strengthen the safeguards that protect the approximately six million New York residents that have joined managed care outfits, by standardizing grievance procedures, for example. Providers of services, like physicians, also gain protections, including the opportunity to challenge decisions to end their contracts.</p>
<p>The workers' compensation bill, which like the two healthcare bills already was approved by the Senate, had stalled in part due to the objections voiced by the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall.</p>
<p>A provision the comptroller said would prevent his office from carrying out its constitutional mandate to audit payments before they are sent to injured workers is not expected to be enforced.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be the understanding,&quot; said the legislative source.</p>
<p>He added that at a later date, the legislature is expected to approve a measure that would correct the provision.</p>
