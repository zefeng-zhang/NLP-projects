<p>Eli Lilly &amp; Co expects marketing and administration costs in the fourth quarter to be only slightly up or flat versus the year-ago level, marking a slowdown from a third-quarter jump of 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>The line item &quot;may be up a couple percent, but certainly below the growth rates we showed in the third quarter,&quot; Lilly chief financial officer Charles Golden said in an interview.</p>
<p>Lilly's gross profit margin declined again in the third quarter, partly due to increased marketing costs for launching new products, such as the anti-schizophrenia drug Zyprexa.  </p>
<p>Zyprexa is one of a handful of new, higher-margin products that will begin to lift sales in the fourth quarter, but a margin trend turnaround is likely further off, Golden said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's going to be sometime next year. I'm not sure it's in the next quarter,&quot; Golden said of improved margins.</p>
<p>Gross margin has declined for two consecutive quarters.</p>
<p>Other than that, analysts greeted Lilly's third-quarter results with a positive tone.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't see any real big surprises in these numbers,&quot; said NatWest Securities drug industry analyst John Lamberton.  </p>
<p>Lilly's third-quarter operating profits of $0.64 per share, versus $0.54 per share in 1995, were precisely in line with Wall Street expectations, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Mariola Haggar.</p>
<p>The company said an 11-percent sales gain was led by the anti-depressant Prozac, the human insulin Humulin and increased revenues from the PCS Health Systems unit.</p>
<p>Shares in Lilly were up 1/2 to 69-1/4 on Tuesday after the Indianapolis-based drugmaker reported an 18-percent gain in third-quarter earnings over the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, Golden said, Lilly will likely lose a small benefit to earnings per share stemming from a decline in outstanding shares versus the prior year. That benefit, caused by the split-off of Guidant Corp last year, boosted third-quarter earnings by five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We will lose that in the fourth quarter ... You're talking a penny or two per share,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, the company will also lose a small boost to earnings from a lower tax rate that lifted third-quarter earnings slightly compared with the prior year.</p>
