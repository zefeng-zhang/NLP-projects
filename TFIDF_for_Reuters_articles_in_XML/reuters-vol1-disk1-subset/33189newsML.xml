<p>The deadly, gadget-packed cars driven by film masterspy James Bond will be displayed in a special exhibit at the Paris Car Show in October, organisers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The display will feature trucks, motorcycles and even a tank with ejectible seats and missile launchers that helped Bond elude his sinister enemies in 17 films ranging from &quot;Dr. No&quot; to the recent blockbuster &quot;GoldenEye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We think the exhibit should attract a lot of people,&quot; chief organiser Bernard Vernier-Palliez told a news conference.</p>
<p>The show, which opens on October 3 and runs for 10 days, will feature more than 850 more conventional vehicles -- 30 shown for the first time -- made in 34 countries.</p>
<p>It will also feature a special Ladies' Night on October 7 in which thousands of readers of women's magazines published by France's Hachette-Filippachi will choose among 10 models to select the ideal woman's car.</p>
