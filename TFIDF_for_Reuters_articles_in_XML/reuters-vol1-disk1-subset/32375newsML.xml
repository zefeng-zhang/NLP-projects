<p>The European Commission, reacting to a scandal of child sex killings in Belgium, announced on Wednesday it would propose new measures to stamp out child pornography and the sex trade.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a challenge to all of us to assume our responsabilites and respond as quickly as we can,&quot; Commissioner Leon Brittan told the European Parliament, convenying the Commission's &quot;deep sense of shock and horror&quot; at the events.</p>
<p>The EU executive would study carefully the conclusions and action plan drawn up by an international conference in Sweden on the sexual exploitation of children, he said.</p>
<p>It was already drafting proposals to stamp out child sex tourism and was working on a report on preventing trafficking in women and young girls for prostitution, which would include issues such as migration and police cooperation, he said.</p>
<p>A proposal by the EU's Irish presidency to extend the mandate of the fledgling European police force, Europol, to cover trafficking in people was a welcome development, Brittan said.</p>
<p>While freedom of information was a basic right and a delicate constitutional issue, the Commission wanted to find ways to prevent abuse of the Internet by paedophile rings, he added.</p>
<p>Separately, Irish Euro-MP Mary Banotti said Europol should set up a special database to help to track down missing children. It should contain information on all missing children under the age of 16, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who have children can pass easily through our borders, this is now a European-wide issue,&quot; Banotti, the European Parliament's mediator on abducted children, was reported in a statement as telling a parliament committee.</p>
<p>Belgian Christian Democrat deputy Raphael Chanterie slammed Europeans for continuing to tolerate sex tourism to Asia, advertised openly in the West, and do nothing to stop the trade in Eastern women for the European sex industry.</p>
<p>EU states must urgently ratify the Europol convention and agree on a computer network system which would make police cooperation possible, he said.</p>
<p>French Union for Europe deputy Marie-Therese Hermange said the inter-governmental conference on reform of the EU treaty should give the EU the power to tackle trafficking in people.</p>
<p>The European Parliament is due to reconsider the question of child abuse when it meets its plenary session in Strasbourg on September 16-20.</p>
