<p>Five years after Volkswagen AG dropped its head-scratching &quot;Fahrvergnugen&quot; ad slogan, the German automaker has finally found a way to reconnect with car buyers hungry for something different.</p>
<p>Volkswagen, enjoying a sales rebound this year, now markets itself to younger buyers on a budget. Ads feature wide-angle camera shots of twentysomethings and their Weimaraner dogs, Trek mountain bikes and the 1960s cartoon icon, Speed Racer.</p>
<p>The year-old &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; campaign has struck a chord, and sales, up more than 14 percent this year through July, should be the strongest since 1988 for Volkswagen in the United States.</p>
<p>Steve Wilhite, senior marketing executive for Volkswagen of America Inc., expects sales to reach 140,000 units. That would be up 22 percent from 115,114 in 1995, and the highest since 168,800 vehicles were sold in 1988.</p>
<p>Volkswagen, which ranks as the fourth-largest automaker in the world, has always cultivated a unique, quirky image among the American public. But &quot;Fahrvergnugen,&quot; which means the &quot;pleasure of driving,&quot; failed to convey that.</p>
<p>Then came problems at Volkswagen's Pueblo, Mexico, assembly plant starting in 1992. For 18 months introduction of key new models was delayed, and sales plunged to under 50,000 units in 1993. That's a far cry from 1970, when U.S. Volkswagen sales peaked at 569,696 cars and vans.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1994, Volkswagen slashed 43 percent of its North American sales and marketing staff and consolidated U.S. and Canadian operations at its Auburn Hills, Mich., complex.</p>
<p>Now back on its feet with freshened products, Volkswagen plans a series of overhauls to its U.S. offerings through the year 2000. Next spring it will introduce an all-new version of its Passat. In 1998, the U.S. is expected to get a new Jetta and the much-awaited successor to the beloved Beetle.</p>
<p>Volkswagen could introduce some other &quot;surpises&quot; before 2000, but none will be in the hottest U.S. market segment -- sport/utility vehicles -- said Wilhite. Volkswagen officials predict it can boost annual U.S. sales as much as 20 percent.</p>
<p>Wilhite is enthusiastic about Volkswagen's sales momentum, believing it brings customers back to a rich heritage, a time when Beetle drivers passing on isolated highways would flash their lights in greeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The key for us is really taking wonderful products that offer a very real experiential difference from our Japanese and domestic competitors and effectively communicating to the market who we are and why we deserve considering,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, Volkswagen car buyers get a vehicle with a distinct personality. Seats are made with a &quot;rising ramp&quot; construction. Although providing strong ergonomic support, they initially feel like flat boards compared to seats in many cars made by Detroit's Big Three automakers.</p>
<p>And American buyers, who have developed high cupholder expectations, may be disappointed with the Jetta. The top-selling Volkswagen U.S. vehicle offers two Dixie-cup sized holders, a far cry from the versatile claw-like system found in a Chrysler Corp. minivan.</p>
<p>Dealers and analysts credit Volkswagnen's turnaround to more consistent management. They also said the &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; campaign, created by the Boston advertising agency of Arnold Fortuna Lawner &amp; Cabot, has positioned Volkswagen as the automaker of choice for active, young individuals.</p>
<p>Bob Lewis, whose San Jose, Calif., Volkswagen dealership was the largest in the United States last year, said he was seeing first-time buyers that were previously lost to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Bringing those people in are attractive leases offering new cars for about $200 a month. Art Spinella, who runs CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore., said lease sales rose 50 percent to about 38 percent of total sales in the first half.</p>
<p>Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs &amp; Associates auto consultants, said Volkswagen's prediction of up to 20 percent annual sales growth may be optimistic. She said the company's niche in the middle to low end of the market could make it vulnerable to the rising popularity of some used cars.</p>
<p>But she said the new Beetle will inject a fresh sense of style into the Volkswagen brand image. &quot;I think the new Beetle will have a broad appeal across age groups,&quot; she said.</p>
