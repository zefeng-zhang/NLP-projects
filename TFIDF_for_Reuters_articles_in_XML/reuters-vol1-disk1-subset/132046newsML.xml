<p>More Hong Kong people than ever are looking forward to the territory's return to Chinese rule next July 1, according to the results of an opinion poll released on Monday.</p>
<p>Contentment is running at its highest level since such polls on the sovereignty handover were started in 1994, Asian Commercial Research Ltd (ACR) said in an extract on the poll's findings.</p>
<p>The survey, commissioned by the South China Morning Post newspaper and conducted October 16-18, polled 624 people, 56 percent of whom said they were happy about the handover against only 18 percent who said they were saddened.</p>
<p>The 38-point margin is the widest ever in opinion polls about the handover, ACR said.</p>
<p>What makes the surge in optimism more surprising is that the poll was conducted in the immediate aftermath of remarks by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that commemorations of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square would not be tolerated in Hong Kong after the handover.</p>
<p>In a similar survey in August, 31.5 percent said they would be happy while 22.5 percent would not. In July, the figures were 38 and 28 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Respondents who offered no opinion fell to 26 percent, compared with 46 percent in August, the survey found.</p>
<p>Men were more confident, with 66 percent saying they were happy about the handover while only 45 percent of women felt the same.</p>
<p>Forty-seven percent of respondents, however, said they had no plans to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Only 10.4 percent wanted to attend handover celebrations the night of June 30, while 8.5 percent said they would make merry in the streets, 15.7 percent planned to do so at home, and 1.6 percent said they would sleep through the historic moment.</p>
