<headline>BA confirms makes new bid for Air Liberte.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Airways confirmed on Wednesday that it has joined with French bank Groupe Rivaud to submit a new bid for insolvent French airline Air Liberte.</p>
<p>The British airline said in a statement that the two companies have submitted a joint bid to Liberte's administrator offering to invest 630 million francs in equity.  </p>
<p>BA is to pay 440 million of the 630 million francs for a 70 percent stake, leaving Air Liberte's biggest current shareholder with 30 percent.</p>
<p>Industry sources said Rivaud is also going to write off existing convertible debt of just over 500 million francs which it is owed by Air Liberte and will provide Liberte with 50-60 million francs of new loan capital.</p>
<p>In addition BA and Rivaud have agreed to pay about 150 million francs to cover costs incurred by Air Liberte's administrator, with BA paying two-thirds of the total.  </p>
<p>BA chief executive Robert Ayling urged the administrator to make a quick decision, promising that jobs would be saved.</p>
<p>&quot;Our partnership with the Groupe Rivaud offers the ideal solution to Air Liberte's very poor financial position. To save it requires swift action,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Our serious and detailed offer includes plans for preserving 1,250 jobs, keeping 13 out of its 15 aircraft and all its domestic routes, including those to Reunion and the French West Indies. Air Liberte would remain a French airline with French management, French staff and French investors.&quot;  </p>
<p>BA launched its own bid for Air Liberte earlier this month. It originally offered 25 million francs but industry sources said that that offer to the administrator had already been raised to 100 million francs.</p>
<p>BA revealed last week it had also already offered to invest a further 440 million francs in turning Liberte back into profit within three years.</p>
<p>BA says it believes it can make the airline profitable by running it in tandem with its own French subsidiary TAT to give BA critical mass in the French market.  </p>
<p>Air Liberte lost 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 but analysts say BA has its eyes on Liberte's control of about a quarter of all runway slots at Paris Orly airport and believes that a local air fare war sparked by liberalisation of the market will eventually abate.</p>
<p>BA says Air Liberte carried 2.6 million passengers in 1995/1996, operates 15 aircraft and has about 12 percent of the French domestic market from Orly.</p>
<p>In comparison TAT operates 26 aircraft, carried 1.8 million passengers last year and has a 10 percent share of the French domestic market from Orly.</p>
<p>TAT chairman Marc Rochet would also become chairman and managing director of Air Liberte, although the two airlines would remain as two distinct companies for the time being, British Airways said on Wednesday.</p>
