<p>Development of the energy sector in east and central Europe may be stunted by insufficient investment in natural gas to meet future demand, a senior World Bank official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hossein Razavi, chief of the Oil and Gas Division of the World Bank in Washington, told a news conference that economics and risk deterred investors.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the two determining factors for every investor. The economics of projects are not attractive because of low gas prices linked to the heavily subsidised prices of the past. These need adjusting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And risks deter investors even when prices are high,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He saw both sector-specific risks and those associated with the political and economic stability of individual countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of stability affects the creditworthiness of countries. This is determined by a pretty rigid system around the world and it's hard for a country with a poor credit rating to get investment&quot;, Razavi said.</p>
<p>The World Bank sees its role as trying to improve economic conditions through policy dialogue with governments, making risk more acceptable to investors by investing itself as a form of &quot;comfort&quot; to others and helping to establish bodies to enforce standards in environmental practices.</p>
<p>The bank has also established a guarantee instrument which allows the private sector to undertake investments while the World Bank takes the risk.</p>
<p>Razavi, attending the third International Energy Agency gas conference here, saw an investment requirement of 20 billion over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>&quot;By many accounts this is an underestimate but we are limiting the estimate to what we think the industry can realistically expect in funds, not to what companies would like if the funding were available,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Boleslaw Rey, director of the Polish Oil and Gas Company with responsibility for relations with the World Bank, agreed that subsidies were the biggest problem for the industry in Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect household gas prices to reach normal economic levels in three to four years,&quot; he said. &quot;But it depends on the government. The government has always subsidised gas and is worried by the effect of raising prices on inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation is running at 17 percent now, while gas prices have only gone up by nine percent. So our biggest problem is cash flow as a result of low prices&quot;.</p>
