<p>President Bill Clinton declared on Wednesday that U.S. missile strikes had achieved their objective in Iraq, as allied planes enforced a bigger no-fly zone and reported stifling a few Iraqi challenges.</p>
<p>&quot;The air strikes, the missile strikes, that were conducted over the last few days have been successful,&quot; Clinton told reporters summoned to hear his view of the latest U.S. efforts to bring Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to heel.</p>
<p>&quot;The targets are either destroyed or sufficiently damaged so that you can say that our mission has been achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Although CNN quoted Iraqi officials as saying Baghdad itself had now been struck by U.S. cruise missiles, Clinton and other U.S. officials denied such an attack had occurred.</p>
<p>The president commented after U.S. forces had finished firing 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi anti-aircraft defences over two days and U.S. and British jets began enforcing a no-fly zone expanded to include a wider swath of southern Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the allied planes had scared off two Iraqi MiGs that briefly approached them, with no shots fired, and a U.S. F-16 had fired a missile at an anti-aircraft radar that had begun tracking it.</p>
<p>They said the radar fell silent but could not say whether that was because the missile had destroyed it.</p>
<p>Clinton said all this had taught Saddam a necessary lesson -- although he could not predict how long it would restrain the Iraqi leader, an irrepressible U.S. foe since his 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the allied intervention it provoked.</p>
<p>&quot;What has happened is that this has changed the strategic situation, particularly in the southern part of Iraq, which Saddam used as his staging ground for the invasion of Kuwait,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;He is strategically worse off than he was before these strikes began.&quot;</p>
<p>The president added: &quot;Obviously we can't predict entirely what Saddam Hussein will do, but now he knows there is a price to be paid for stepping over the line that the U.N. resolutions imposed (after the 1991 Gulf War).&quot;</p>
<p>The unilateral U.S. cruise missile strikes, carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday, were provoked by Saddam's decision to attack Iraqi Kurds in a northern area under allied protection.</p>
<p>Clinton said it appeared Saddam was now withdrawing those troops, at least for now.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in northern Iraq seems to have changed,&quot; he said. &quot;There has been a withdrawal of the (Iraqi) forces, a dispersal of the forces -- but it's too soon to say that this is permanent or that further action will not be taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Even so, he added, &quot;What we have done is to show that we are prepared to change the strategic realities that Saddam Hussein faces if he violates the U.N. prohibitions on either threatening his neighbours or repressing his own people.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton rejected suggestions the unilateral intervention had also exacted a price from the United States by alienating some Gulf War coalition partners, most notably France. One reporter suggested the coalition was now &quot;dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think its dead,&quot; Clinton replied. &quot;I think quite to the contrary. We have received good support from the British. The prime minister of Canada called me last night. The German chancellor issued a strong statement ... I think things are on track.&quot;</p>
<p>When U.S. and British planes took off to enforce the expanded no-fly zone on Wedneday, however, the French jets that normally accompany them limited their support to the previously defined zone, French officials in Paris said.</p>
<p>Whatever the international impact, Clinton appears to have gained some domestic political advantage from his stand.</p>
<p>Early polling evidence suggests most Americans supported the president, as they usually do in crises. And the episode in any case kept Clinton in the limelight while diverting attention from his November 5 election opponent, Republican nominee Bob Dole.</p>
