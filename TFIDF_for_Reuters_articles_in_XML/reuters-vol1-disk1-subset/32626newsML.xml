<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS - Kellogg trade raises eyebrows.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>A big trade in two Kellogg Co put options before the company issued an earnings warning may have been from investors who knew bad news was coming, market watchers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At about 1525 EDT (1825 GMT), a trade of 1,500 Kellogg October 65 puts crossed as part of a spread.</p>
<p>The option premium was 7/8, up just 1/16 from Tuesday's close, but the open interest on the option through Tuesday was just five contracts.</p>
<p>After the market closed, Kellogg said its third quarter and full year earnings would fall below comparable 1995 results.  </p>
<p>Jay Shartsis, director of options trading at R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co, said the fact that there was virtually no open interest in the option would likely raise a red flag.</p>
<p>The other part of the spread appeared to be 500 of the Kellogg September 75 puts, which went out at 6-1/2. This option had an open interest of 3,488 through Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;These guys were looking for a real disaster&quot; in the stock, Michael Schwartz, managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, said of the players who did the Kellogg put trades.  </p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange trading, Kellogg shares ended the regular session at 68-1/2, down 7/8, on modest volume.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes after the close of trading, the Battle Creek, Michigan-based cereal maker said its third quarter earnings would fall about 20 percent below the $1.05 a share it earned in the 1995 third quarter and its full year earnings would fall short of the $3.48 a share it earned in 1995.</p>
<p>The company said its decision to slash cereal prices was the reason for the expected slowdown.</p>
<p>Traders said Kellogg shares quickly tumbled to 66, down 2-1/2 from the NYSE close, in after-hours trading.  </p>
<p>Schwartz said it appeared the options investors had positioned themselves to take advantage of a drop in the stock, whether they bought the September 75 puts and sold the October 65 puts or bought both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the strategy, this smells of front-running the news by some informed people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the American Stock Exchange, where Kellogg options trade, declined to say whether the exchange was looking into the trades, saying the exchange always looks at options activity. --G.Crawford, (312) 408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
