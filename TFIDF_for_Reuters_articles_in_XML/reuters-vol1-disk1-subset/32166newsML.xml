<title>USA: CBOT corn closes lower on FCC crop estimate, soy.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn closes lower on FCC crop estimate, soy.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>CBOT corn futures closed sharply lower on bearish input from a crop estimate by Iowa-based Farmers Commodities Corp and on a slide in soybean futures, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The FCC numbers set the tone early along with the close yesterday,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>Corn fell in late dealings Tuesday and the crop outlook from Farmers Commodities Corp at 9.02 billion bushels added further pressure to the already weak technical picture in early dealings Wednesday. FCC's estimate was above USDA's forecast for 8.695 billion bushels but below FCC's previous outlook for 9.081 billion.</p>
<p>Traders said current weather patterns in the U.S. Midwest were overall bearish and cited potential rainfall coming into the eastern growing region as a potential remnant of Hurricane Fran. The market was underpinned by the lagging maturity of the crop with bulls saying cold weather anytime soon could harm yield prospects.</p>
<p>Meteorologists early Wednesday said cool weather was expected in the Midwest by Saturday but they differed on how low temperatures would fall.</p>
<p>Corn closed eight cents per bushel lower to one higher, with September down eight at $3.58-3/4 a bushel.</p>
<p>Estimated volume for corn futures was 45,000 contracts, about the same as 45,095 Tuesday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>In corn options Cargill Investor Services bought 600 December $3.30 calls and bought 600 December $3.30 puts at 33 cents, traders said. Smith Barney bought 600 December $2.90 puts and sold 600 December $3.00 puts at 1-1/2, LFG Futures bought 600 December $3.10 puts and bought 500 December $3.00 puts, sources said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 14,000 contracts, up from 7,750 Tuesday.</p>
