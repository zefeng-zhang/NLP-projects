<p>NWE gas oil prices eased on underlying futures on Wednesday and lack of demand and mild weather squeezed premiums, traders said.</p>
<p>Nov IPE futures finished down $5 at $225.75 a tonne, dragged lower by NYMEX heating oil which saw some liquidation following bearish overnight API statistics.</p>
<p>Cargoes of winter grade (-7/-22) heating oil were bid at Nov IPE +3 and offered at +$4, $1 adrift from Tuesday. Russian was offered at Nov IPE +$1 and bid at Nov IPE flat to 50 cents.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel was talked at $23/26, $1 lower. Interest was absent because most traders have covered their October needs.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather is fine today -- blue skies, no rain. Prices can't revive yet,&quot; one German trader added.</p>
<p>On barges, views varied on premiums in the absence of trades. Low sulphur winter grade (-7/-22) diesel was talked at $35, with intermediate (-3/-13) at Nov IPE +$33, some traders said. There was little buying interest and other players put winter grade in the low 30s.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very difficult. It's listless out there,&quot; said another German trader. &quot;It's still not cold enough to tempt people to buy oil.&quot;</p>
