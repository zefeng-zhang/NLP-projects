<headline>Senate delays approval of new ambassador to Vietnam.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>The U.S. Senate on Wednesday delayed until next year consideration of Representative Pete Peterson to be the new U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, prompting expressions of regret from both Peterson and the State Department.</p>
<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee said approval of Peterson this year would violate the Constitution and delayed a hearing on his appointment until 1997. The State Department and Peterson disagreed.</p>
<p>&quot;We were very disappointed,&quot; State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said in response to a question.</p>
<p>A committee spokesman said Peterson's appointment would violate an article of the Constitution that provides that no member of Congress can be appointed to an office created, or for which the pay was changed, during his term.</p>
<p>Davies said it was the administration's view that Peterson's appointment did not violate the Constitution. Peterson himself -- a Florida Democrat who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam -- agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;I would never support any action that could be perceived as a violation of the Constitution,&quot; Peterson said in a written statement expressing his disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;I do think a legitimate question exists as to the committee's interpretation of that clause.&quot;</p>
<p>Peterson said it was &quot;important that the government of both the U.S. and Vietnam continue to develop and expand their bilateral relationship during this unfortunate delay in posting an ambassador to Hanoi.&quot;</p>
<p>Peterson would be the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam since the war ended more than two decades ago. The two countries formally established diplomatic links last year.</p>
<p>Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, has taken no position on whether the United States should send an ambassador to Vietnam and whether it should be Peterson.</p>
