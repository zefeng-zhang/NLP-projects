<p>The Australian semi-government bond market saw a pick-up in volatility last week after several quiet weeks amid a general shake-out of local bond markets after the Reserve Bank went some way to douse policy easing hopes.</p>
<p>Australian debt had been fullying factoring in the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction in current 7.0 percent official interest rates up until the central bank's quarterly Bulletin, but the outlook now is not so clear with the RBA expressing concerns over wages growth.</p>
<p>&quot;There's certainly been a bit more volatlity in semi spreads than say the last six months,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's was notably heavy selling in the mid-part of the curve last week. Spreads have been in four (basis points), out four, but there's been no definite trend,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>However, the week started quietly as the market braced itself for two key events, the September quarter inflation on Wednesday and, given the RBA's wages warning perhaps of more interest, the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) for the Ausgust quarter on Thursday.</p>
<p>Both sets of data are expected the be relatively subdued with underlying inflation seen rising 0.6 percent to a year-on-year 2.5 percent and back within the RBA's 2.0-3.0 percent target range, according to a Reuters survey of economists.</p>
<p>Headline CPI is expected to be even lower in annual terms, rising by just 0.3 percent in the quarter to a year-on-year 2.2 percent. Both rates were 3.1 percent in the June quarter.</p>
<p>AWOTE is seen up 1.0 percent on the quarter to an annual 3.7 percent, and well below the central bank's comfort zone which is seen at around 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bond supply into the Australian debt market is likely to be thin in the light of this week's key reports.</p>
<p>&quot;We're already at QTC's (Queensland Treasury Corp) window, but we haven't heard anything from them yet,&quot; one trader added.</p>
<p>QTC, which normally comes to the market every four to six weeks, last tendered A$100 million on September 19.  </p>
