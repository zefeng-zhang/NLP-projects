<p>Stock prices were mixed Wednesday, as investors sat on the sidelines awaiting a key employment report on Friday that is expected to help the Federal Reserve decide whether to boost interest rates.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 3.33 points at 5,645.06.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 12-9 on light volume of 198 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.32 to 1,142.61. The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.44 to 557.35.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond was off one-half point and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7.10 percent from 7.06 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;People are not going to be terribly aggressive until the big number due Friday is behind us,&quot; said Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>The August non-farm payrolls report due early Friday is expected to reinforce or shatter doubts whether the Fed will raise or keep interest rates unchanged at its policy-setting meeting on Sept. 24.</p>
<p>The market shrugged off weaker-than-expected July construction spending, which fell 1.4 percent compared with analysts' forecasts for a drop of only 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a 'wait and see' feeling until the Friday employment figures,&quot; Acuff said. &quot;It has been almost the defining statistic since February for the markets, so it's very reasonable for money managers to sit on their hands until then.&quot;</p>
<p>Acuff said the market was bracing for earnings warnings ahead of the start of third-quarter results, which will start to be released in October.</p>
<p>&quot;Equity is still pretty highly valued, and with bonds getting higher yields, its hard for stocks to make much progress,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stock of energy companies fell after gaining Tuesday as crude oil prices soared on news of the U.S. military strike against Iraqi targets.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices were up 8 cents at $23.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pausing after soaring $1.15 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Exxon Corp. fell 1/4 to 83-3/8, Chevron Corp.slipped 7/8 to 59, Mobil Corp. was down 1/2 to 114-7/8, and Texaco Inc. fell 1/8 to 91-5/8.</p>
<p>Among special situations, Office Depot jumped 4 to 19-3/4, after it agreed to be purchased by Staples Inc. Staples shares fell 1-3/8 to 18-1/8.</p>
<p>Paging Partners rose 1/8 to 2 after announcing that it had hired Laidlaw &amp; Co.to help evaluate its strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of the company.</p>
<p>Chateau Properties climbed 3/8 to 26-1/2 after Samuel Zell's Manufactured Home Communities launched a new $26 a share bid for the firm.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid lost 3-3/4 to 22-3/4 after the company said it expected disappointing third quarter earnings.</p>
