<p>The world price of copper seemed this week to have settled into a new slightly higher range after languishing below $2,000 per tonne since the Sumitomo Corp scandal in mid-June. But views were mixed on how far it might rally and on how long it could hold above that psychological threshold. Copper tumbled in June from around $2,700 as Sumitomo of Japan fired its star trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, who had been defending a long position in the market. It alleged he ran up losses of $1.8 billion on unauthorised trades. Options-related selling on Wednesday knocked London Metal Exchange (LME) three-months copper briefly down to $1,990. But it then met good buying and short covering and ended the London afternoon around $2,020.</p>
<p>In the short-term, resistance is now pegged at the recent 2-1/2 month high of $2,165, followed by $2,200, analysts said.</p>
<p>But brokerage GNI Ltd said in a special report that the longer term prospect was less buoyant.</p>
<p>Rising copper production and the possibility that consumption growth forecasts will be too optimistic put the market on course for surpluses this year and next, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;GNI believes that the world copper market will see a surplus of around 189,000 tonnes in 1996, 150,000 tonnes of which will come in the second half of the year,&quot; GNI said.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997, preliminary indications suggest that the surplus will rise to around 450,000 tonnes,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>China remains the great unknown in the market place, after recent years of considerable activity with state reserve stockpile liquidation and re-purchase having become commonplace.</p>
<p>&quot;At present, there is talk of both the sale of 150,000 tonnes and gossip about the possibility of a large stock drawdown in September,&quot; GNI said.</p>
<p>However, the market should focus on stock movements on the London Metal Exchange (LME), as recent increases suggest an annualised rise of over 600,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;If stocks continue to build at this rate it will offset any movements made by China&quot;.</p>
<p>The new U.S. hostilities against Iraq continued to leave commodity markets outside the petroleum sector unmoved.</p>
<p>Gold lost $1.0 an ounce on disappointment that it had failed to rally, either because it no longer enjoyed its traditional &quot;safe haven&quot; role in time of tension, or because nobody was worried enough about the Middle East to feel they needed one. Other commodity prices were also mostly flat.</p>
<p>Benchmark Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat futures were scarely changed on the day at around $4.50 a bushel.</p>
<p>Coffee eased but recovered on bargain-hunting. London cocoa ended firm after briefly sliding to six-month low.</p>
