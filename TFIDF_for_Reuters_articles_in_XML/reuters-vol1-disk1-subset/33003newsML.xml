<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shekel stable against dollar, basket.</title>
<headline>Israeli shekel stable against dollar, basket.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Israeli shekel closed almost unchanged against the dollar and the basket of foreign currencies in very quiet trading following a small-scale intervention of the Bank of Israel, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank started buying foreign currency just before the setting of the representative rate,&quot; said Guy Levi at Bank Leumi.</p>
<p>&quot;The basket was trading during most of the day slightly below the lower range of the band but following the intervention it rose to 7.0 percent below the slope,&quot; Levi said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very quiet today. The Bank of Israel did not buy from us today because the basket remained stable during the whole day,&quot; said a dealer at Israel Discount Bank.</p>
<p>The shekel can fluctuate in a trading band of 7.0 percent above or below a slope designed to devalue the Israeli currency at six percent a year against a basket of foreign currencies, representing Israel's main trading partners.</p>
<p>If the shekel-basket exchange rate reaches the lower trading band the central bank intervenes by buying foreign currency.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was 3.1470 against 3.1480 on Tuesday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, closed at 3.5423 shekels against 3.5416 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.8886 shekels per 100 yen against 2.8834 on Tuesday and against the mark at 2.1190 shekels per mark against 2.1175 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.1470 shekels.</p>
