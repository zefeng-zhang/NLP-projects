<p>Polish shares stayed virtually flat in higher turnover and analysts saw them easing on Thursday on the back of stronger selling after price fixing but said stabilisation was likely on Friday or next week.</p>
<p>Analysts said the WIG index, currently at 14,123.4 points, was unlikely to fall below 14,000 or 13,500 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Some stock prices start looking attractive and investors are likely to take advantage of that but first of all I don't see any fundamental reasons for further falls,&quot; said Czeslaw Pospieszynski, an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage. (Corrects from &quot;said Czeslaw Pospieszynski, a trader at Polish Development Bank brokerage.&quot;)  </p>
<p>He pointed out that the firms showed good September earnings and the overall economic climate was positive, which justified some growth or at least a halt to falls, which took WIG 6.3 percent down from the October 9 high of 15,078.7.</p>
<p>But analysts said Espebepe case, which said it could go bankrupt if it failed to clinch a debt-cutting deal with its creditors, could have a cooling effect on the market, which so far has been spared bankruptcies of listed stocks.</p>
<p>Espebepe, Wednesday's top loser, plunged 9.6 percent and analysts saw it extending its fall in the next few sessions.  </p>
<p>The main market's WIG index eased 0.1 percent to 14,123.4, and turnover rose 9.3 percent to 112.6 million zlotys on both markets as 31 issues rose, 20 fell and 29 were flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said primary market offerings such as Bank Ochrony Srodowiska (BOS) and Drosed were draining funds away from the bourse and a stronger rebound was possible after some of the capital flows back into the market in mid-November.</p>
<p>NFI units rose 3.8 percent in 32.7-million-zloty trade in regular session but fell 1.3 percent in 16 -million-zloty continuous trade.</p>
