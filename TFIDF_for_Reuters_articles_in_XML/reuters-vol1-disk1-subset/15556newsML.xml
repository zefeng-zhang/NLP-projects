<p>Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd said Tuesday it has a very strong recovery in group profits in the first quarter of the 1996/97 business year.</p>
<p>Matsushita posted net profit of 18.5 billion yen ($172 million) on a group basis in the three months to June 30, rebounding from a huge loss of 151.3 billion yen ($1.41 billion) a year ago.</p>
<p>Sales in the April-June period were 1.72 trillion yen ($16.0 billion), up from 1.53 trillion yen ($14.2 billion) a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Our business (in the first quarter of the current business year) was better than the same period a year ago both in Japan and abroad,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>In Japan, consumer spending and companies' capital investment were rebounding gradually, and the nation's economy was on a gradual recovery trend, although some worries over the future of the economy remained, Matsushita said.</p>
<p>Economies in the United States and Asia were strong and the European economy started showing signs of recovery, it said.</p>
<p>In most of the company's divisions, sales were up by between 10 and 26 percent from year-ago levels, Matsushita said. But it also said sales at its electronic parts division fell 3 percent, partly due to the sluggish semiconductor market.</p>
<p>Cost-cutting and the weaker yen also boosted group profits in the first quarter, Matsushita said. A drop in the yen makes Japanese companies more competitive overseas, because it lowers the price of their goods in foreign exchange terms.</p>
<p>Matsushita said it posted a group net loss in the first quarter of 1995/96 because of foreign exchange losses stemming from the sale of an 80 percent stake in U.S. filmmaker MCA Inc. If the impact of the sale was excluded, Matsushita would have made a group net profit of 12.9 billion yen ($120 million) in that quarter, it said.</p>
<p>Despite a strong recovery in group earnings in the first quarter, Matsushita said it had not changed its forecast for its parent current profit and sales for the half-year to Sept. 30, 1996, because there remained uncertainties over the overall Japanese economy and the yen/dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>Matsushita had projected its April-September parent current profit at 46 billion yen ($429 million) on expected sales of 2.2 trillion yen ($20.5 billion).</p>
<p>In 1995/96, Matsushita posted a first-half parent current profit of 41.22 billion yen ($385 million) on sales of 2.16 trillion yen ($20.1 billion).</p>
