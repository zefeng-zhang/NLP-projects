<p>-- OFT WANTS TOUR COVER CLAMPDOWN</p>
<p>Director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, John Bridgeman, is set to publish the findings of his investigation into Britain's package-holiday industry and will recommend tougher reforms than those enforced by Sir Bryan Carsberg, his predecessor. Mr Bridgeman will press for change in the way holiday insurance is sold and is unconvinced that Sir Bryan's minor changes have helped the consumer.</p>
<p>-- WATER GROUPS HIT AT DOBSON</p>
<p>Frank Dobson, Labour's environment spokesman, has been accused by water companies of endangering their efforts to win overseas business because of his outspoken attacks on their operations. They complained to senior Labour Party front-benchers that French rivals are using Mr Dobson's criticism to undermine their efforts in key foreign contracts. He refutes the allegations.</p>
<p>-- AN EVERYDAY TALE OF A 50 MILLION STG PUB FLOTATION</p>
<p>Discovery Inns, one of several pub companies created in the wake of the government's Beer Orders of 1989, which forced most national brewers to sell hundreds of tied outlets, have announced a 50 million stg flotation. A syndicate led by Kleinwort Benson Development Capital owns 96 percent of the equity and will sell out in the flotation for 30 to 35 million pounds. The company will also raise between 15 and 20 million stg to repay debt.</p>
<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>-- RETAILERS CONFIDENT OF APPROACHING SALES BOOM</p>
<p>According to a survey from Dun and Bradstreet, shopkeepers are gearing up for booming sales in the run-up to Christmas. About 60 percent of retailers and two-thirds of wholesalers expect an increase in new orders during the next few weeks. They also expect an increase in net sales, net profits and inventories. Selling prices remain subdued and inflationary pressures low.</p>
<p>-- GREYCOAT FACES SURVIVAL THREAT FROM INVESTORS</p>
<p>The 500 million stg property company Greycoat faces a fight for its survival when the UK Active Value Fund, which speaks for 11 percent of the company, calls for the sale of its entire portfolio and the distribution of the proceeds to shareholders. The move will be the biggest auction of property in the City and West End of London for many years, putting on the market some of the capital's most famous buildings.</p>
<p>-- GEORGE WARNS OF NEED TO BE READY FOR EMU IN 1999</p>
<p>The Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George has urged Britain to be ready to enter the European single currency at the start of the 1999 deadline. He refused to endorse or condemn the merits of joining a single currency and said that retailers and other organisations handling a large amount of cash would not need to gear up for fresh arrangements until the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>-- TAX RAID ON MURDOCH FIRM</p>
<p>News Datacom, the Israeli offshoot of a British company controlled by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, has been raided by the tax authorities in Jerusalem over allegations of fiscal irregularities totalling 100 million stg. The raid took place after the issue of a warrant which contains allegations of tax transgressions, tax evasion and helping others to evade taxes of about 150 million dollars between the years 1989 and 1996.</p>
<p>-- BARCLAYS WANTS OUT OF CUSTODY</p>
<p>Barclays Bank will announce the sale of it custody arm to US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which means a withdrawal from the business of custodianship of securities. A once steady earner for the bank has been turned into a specialised international business profitable only on a large scale by increased regulation in the wake of the Maxwell affair, combined with a more demanding attitude from clients and ever-increasing technical costs.</p>
<p>-- PRINCE SEEKS TO BUY PRINCESSES</p>
<p>Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire, is possibly in talks with Lonrho to buy the group's Princess hotel chain in a 300 million stg deal. A spokesman for the group could not confirm reports that the Prince had been given sole negotiation rights to bid for the chain. Glasgow-based leisure group Stakis is also interested in Lonrho's Metropole chain, with a price of 300 million stg or more. Chief executive David Michels is expected to ask shareholders for 230 million stg to facilitate his bid.</p>
<p>THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>-- BSKYB TARGETS PEARSON AS MURDOCH TRIES TO TIGHTEN GRIP ON BRITISH TV</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch's satellite broadcasting company BSkyB is in talks with a US partner that could lead to a joint bid for the media conglomerate Pearson. The plans are aimed at taking advantage of Pearson's volatile share price and are based on Sky's determination to expand its control of British television programming in advance of the launch of 200 channels on digital satellite next year. Independent analysts have said the company could be worth as much as ten pounds stg a share to a buyer prepared to break it up. -- MORGAN GRENFELL 'WAS AWARE OF YOUNG'S ACTIVITIES'</p>
<p>It has emerged that executives at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management failed to recognise irregularities in the activities of disgraced fund manager Peter Young despite knowing about the trades involved more than a year ago. The failure to act is the reason parent company Deutsche Morgan Grenfell decided to sack five senior directors in the asset management arm, including chief executive Keith Percy. It could also lead to Imro, the industry regulator, taking a tougher disciplinary line with Morgan Granfell.</p>
<p>-- INNTREPRENEUR FACES CLASS ACTION</p>
<p>The start of a class action by disgruntled tenants could lead to a new wave of litigation against Inntrepreneur, the pub landlord. The action represents 20 publicans and opens a new front in the battle with the company. The assault focuses on an alleged refusal by Inntrepreneur to renew five-year leases that publicans had signed in the mid-1980s with Courage, the previous landlord. The tenants claim they were illegally forced to sign much more onerous contracts that tied them in for 20 years. For more information phone BMC at +44-171-377-1742</p>
