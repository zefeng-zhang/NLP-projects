<title>USA: Sales of existing homes weaken in July.</title>

<p>Sales of existing homes weakened for a second consecutive month during July, the National Association of Realtors said Monday, as the impact of higher mortgage rates from earlier in the year began to slow the housing market.</p>
<p>The real estate lobby group said sales of existing, or used, homes fell 0.5 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million following a revised 2.8 percent June decline to 4.16 million.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the drop in July sales was not as sharp as anticipated by Wall Street economists, who had forecast sales of existing homes would drop to a rate of 4.10 million a year last month.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales peaked in May at a record rate of 4.28 million a year before starting to lose momentum in June and July.</p>
<p>John Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors' association, said some falloff in sales was normal after the extraordinarily brisk rate of business earlier in the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time a new record is set in the pace of sales, it's inevitable that some slowdown will follow,&quot; he said, adding that the July sales rate still was higher than that posted for any single month in 1995.</p>
<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Fannie Mae, said the average rate for a 30-year mortgage loan in July was 8.25 percent, down from 8.32 percent in June.</p>
<p>That still represents a significant runup in mortgage rates since January, when they averaged 7.03 percent.</p>
<p>The group revised its estimate of June sales to show sales declined at a sharper 2.8 percent rate, to 4.16 million, rather than the 2.3 percent fall to 4.18 million that it reported a month ago.</p>
<p>Regionally, the only area in which sales of existing homes strengthened in July was the Midwest, where they rose 5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, sales were down 1.6 percent to 630,000 a year and in the West they fell 2.2 percent to 900,000. Sales in the South, the nation's largest regional housing market, were down 1.3 percent last month to 1.56 million a year.</p>
<p>The supply of existing homes available for sale in July declined to 2.03 million, or 5.9 months' worth, from 2.21 million, or 6.4 months' worth, at June's sales pace.</p>
<p>The average price for a used home fell sightly in July to $149,400 from $150,200 in June.</p>
