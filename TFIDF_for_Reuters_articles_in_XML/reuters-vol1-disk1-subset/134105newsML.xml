<p>The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday it had unconfirmed but &quot;alarming reports&quot; from Zaire's military of fighting around the eastern Goma region which had caused thousands of Rwandans to flee Kibumba camp.</p>
<p>Spokesman Ron Redmond told Reuters the authorities had reported fighting around the three biggest camps in the Goma region which have a total population of 400,000 Rwandan Hutus.  </p>
<p>The refugees fleeing Kibumba seemed to be heading for Goma, according to the UNHCR spokesman. He did not know whether any refugees had fled Katale and Kahindo camps, where fighting was also reported between the Zairean army and Tutsi rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;Fighting has been reported around three of the biggest refugee camps in all of eastern Zaire, in the Goma region,&quot; Redmond told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We now have reports that thousands of refugees are fleeing Kibumba camp,&quot; he said. &quot;The reports are based on information from the Zairean military. If it is true, it is very alarming.&quot;</p>
<p>Kibumba camp, located some 25 km (15 miles) northeast of Goma, has a population of 194,000 Rwandans who fled massacres in 1994. It is the second largest refugee camp in all of Zaire.</p>
