<p>The three-man presidency of Bosnia met for the first time in Sarajevo on Tuesday after Serbs ended their three-week boycott of the country's governing bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;The  meeting has begun. At the beginning of the meeting international community officials were with them but now they are on their own,&quot; Duncan Bullivant, spokesman for Bosnia envoy Carl Bildt, told reporters.</p>
<p>It was the first meeting of all members of Bosnia's collective presidency since its Serb member, Momcilo Krajisnik, refused to attend an inaugural session and swear an oath of allegiance to the Bosnian Constitution three weeks ago.</p>
<p>In another breakthrough, Krajisnik told the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA he would sign the solemn oath as a &quot;sign that problems in the work of the joint bodies have been overcome.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that apart from the oath, which will be signed without any ceremony, he will also sign a temporary agreement on venues for future sessions of joint institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have intensely worked yesterday and today in trying to find solutions for the work of joint bodies in order for our representatives, including myself, to be able to take the solemn oath,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. troubleshooting envoy John Kornblum on Monday met Krajisnik who offered to hold presidency meetings alternately in Serb and federal parts of Sarajevo.</p>
<p>Kornblum arrived in Sarajevo on Monday to hold talks with Moslem, Croat and Serb leaders in a bid to resolve an impasse in the work of Bosnia's joint governing bodies.</p>
<p>The Serbs have also complained of unequal treatment if the joint governing bodies meet only on Moslem-Croat Federation territory.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reached an agreement with Mr Kornblum and the Moslem side for joint bodies to alternately, every second or third time, hold their session in (Serb-held) Lukavica in the building of the faculty of electrical engineering and in the building of the natural history museum,&quot; Krajisnik said.</p>
<p>The venue of the meeting, the national museum building in the centre of the city under federation control, was under NATO's heavy security blanket on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by Krajisnik and the other two members, the Moslem chair of the presidency, Alija Izetbegovic and Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member.</p>
<p>Krajisnik had initially cited security concerns as reason for not attending the inaugural session.</p>
<p>Serb forces laid siege to Sarajevo for most of the 43-month Bosnian war killing some 10,000 and wounding another 50,000, according to Bosnian government figures.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and his army commander General Ratko Mladic have been indicted by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague for the siege.</p>
<p>Krajisnik apparently ended the boycott just hours after the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in charge of Bosnia's polls, postponed local elections scheduled for late November due to a lack of cooperation by the parties.</p>
<p>The Serbs had said they would boycott the municipal vote, citing security problems in villages resettled by Moslems.</p>
