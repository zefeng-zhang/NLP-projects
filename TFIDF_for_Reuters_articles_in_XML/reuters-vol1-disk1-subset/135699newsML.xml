<p>Second seed Elena Likhovtseva of Russia gave herself a needed confidence boost with a straight sets victory in the first round of the Bell Challenge tennis tournament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Likhovtseva, a first-round loser in Leipzig and Filderstadt, dismissed 64th-ranked Australian Rennae Stubbs 6-3 7-5.</p>
<p>The second seed was joined in the second round by fourth-seeded American Kimberly Po, who breezed past compatriot Corina Morariu 6-2 6-0.</p>
<p>American Jolene Watanabe scored the upset of the day when she rallied from a set down to pick off seventh seed Nana Miyagi of Japan 4-6 6-1 6-4.</p>
<p>&quot;I could have won more easily,&quot; said the 24th-ranked Likhovtseva, who ran off the last four games after falling behind 3-5 in the second set.</p>
<p>&quot;But I lost in the first round of my last two tournaments so this was good for my confidence,&quot; admitted the 21-year-old Likhovtseva, who was originally from Kazakhstan but now lives in Moscow and plays Fed Cup for Russia.</p>
<p>Still, she is passing up a tournament in Moscow to play in Chicago next week.</p>
<p>Asked if that was because of a lack of support from the Russian tennis federation, she smiled and said, &quot;partly.&quot;</p>
<p>Po, who has seen her ranking rise from 164 at the end of last year to her current career-high of 33rd in the world, said she thought she might have a tougher time with the 116th-ranked Morariu.</p>
<p>&quot;The first few games were very even and she played really well,&quot; Po said.</p>
<p>&quot;If she'd played like that the whole match I knew I'd have a hard time. So I tried not to give her any free points and I think she got discouraged.&quot;</p>
