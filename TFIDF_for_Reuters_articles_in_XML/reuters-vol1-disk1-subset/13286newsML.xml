<p>For years cafes in Cairo meant thick scented hookah smoke and tinkling glasses of sugary mint tea. This year some coffehouses have shed their traditional image to become a Cairene sign of the times.</p>
<p>There's no backgammon and Egyptian ballads here -- patrons at Cairo's two cybercafes surf, hang out and chill to the latest pop tunes on compact disc.</p>
<p>The Internet, not the crowd, is the main attraction and coffee is not a mere shouted order but a perculator away.</p>
<p>&quot;What prompted us to open a cybercafe was the frequent questions of people as to where they can go to access the Internet,&quot; said Dr Mona el-Kaddah, vice president of Internet Egypt, the private firm which runs the cafes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a place where people can use the Net, meet and share experiences, give each other ideas and of course socialise through the Internet scene,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Local and foreign students, academics and businessmen are among the many Web surfers who throng to the computer screens at the cybercafes, one in the city centre and one at a shopping mall in a posh suburb.</p>
<p>&quot;I can have an e-mail account or access from the house but I prefer to come here,&quot; said Mohammed Abdel Rahman, a university student who comes to the cafe regularly.</p>
<p>&quot;I can come here and have a coffee, meet my friends, play with the computer and not only get information but I can have fun too,&quot; he added. &quot;For 10 pounds ($3) an hour, its cheaper than shooting pool.&quot;</p>
<p>Young patrons crowd around downloaded Music Television (MTV) videos and sports news while others exchange greetings over the sound of Nirvana and the occassional Mozart. Others relax in the reading room overlooking the Nile.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been to cafes in the States and Holland, and the computing facilities in this place are definitely tops,&quot; said American Keith Brafford, who ran into the cybercafe while on holiday in Egypt.</p>
<p>Three years ago the government, in association with the Foreign Relations Coordination Unit of the Supreme Council of Universities, put Egypt online and now estimates there are more than 200,000 Internet users among its 60 million people.</p>
<p>Access via a leased line costs 15,000 to 20,000 pounds a year but users can surf the information superhighway for rates of around 1,000 pounds a year through a dial-up number.</p>
<p>And unlike in other Middle East countries where governments restrict usage, anyone with a computer and an international phone line can access absolutely anything on the Internet -- a fact which has brought jitters to Egypt's conservative society.</p>
<p>&quot;Security and morality on the Internet are worldwide issues for discussion. We cannot ban such a major information source just because misuse happens everywhere,&quot; said Dr Tarek Kamel of the state's Regional Information Technology and Software Engineering Centre (RITSEC).</p>
<p>Although the state is promoting the Internet as its latest tool for economic, tourist and social development, the media has capitalised on its smuttier side.</p>
<p>Stories of teenagers downloading pornography and paedophilia in other countries and tampering with files of the defence and justice ministries make the front page of Egypt's newspapers. Local technology advances are buried deep inside.</p>
<p>&quot;What about the video and the satellite dish?&quot; Kaddah tells the Internet's opponents.</p>
<p>&quot;We try hard to guide the young people towards constructive information resources at our cybercafes and we make them sign a code of ethics when they join us so that they are aware of what things are acceptable to our society and what things are not. Until now, we haven't had any problems,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Their buzzing cybercafes have prompted Internet Egypt, one of 14 firms selling Internet services in Egypt, to think of opening more sites in Cairo and nationwide. Other companies are also planning to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>But users tend to come from the upper to upper middle income bracket, a minority among Egypt's teeming population. Most Egyptians remain loyal to their waterpipes.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got my traditional cafe with its drinks and hookahs where I go to relax. Why would I ever go to a cybercafe, work on a computer and use my brain?&quot; said cafe customer Gamal Gadd al-Karim.</p>
