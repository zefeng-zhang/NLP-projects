<p>Russia's RAO Gazprom natural gas monopoly said on Wednesday it was preparing to pitch Global and American Depositary Receipts to foreign investors, but declined to say when.</p>
<p>&quot;We really are planning an international share issue,&quot; board member Alexander Semenyaka told a news conference. &quot;We are getting ready to do presentations to investors.&quot;</p>
<p>He confirmed that Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Bank AG's Kleinwort Benson would lead the issues, but declined to say when paper would be sold. &quot;It will be in tranches, and the first tranche will not be very big,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said international accountancy firm Price Waterhouse had completed a western-standard audit of Gazprom's books, but declined to state Gazprom's financials.</p>
<p>Eduard Ivanov, head of Gazprom's securities department, said the audit had produced no surprises and that key numbers might be made public at the end of this month.</p>
<p>&quot;Their numbers do not differ significantly from ours,&quot; he said, referring to Gazprom's previously stated 1995 pre-tax profit of 17 trillion roubles, about triple the 1994 level.</p>
<p>Gazprom's charter says foreign investors may own no more than nine percent of the company.</p>
<p>London banking sources have said they expect paper to be sold by the end of the year and that the first tranche would be only one or one and a half percent. Semenyaka said in July that receipts would be sold by the end of this month or next month.</p>
<p>Officials said the company's decision last month to tighten the rules under which domestic shareholders can trade paper were in the interests of transparency.</p>
<p>&quot;Simple people, simple shareholders, have a hard time understanding how they can work with our shares,&quot; Ivanov said.</p>
<p>Semenyaka said Gazprom was actively buying its shares.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the new rules) reflects the principle of separating the interests of the domestic market from the external one,&quot; Semenyaka said. &quot;Work with small shareholders will be significantly increased so they understand how to work with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Gazprom's 23.6 billion shares are among Russia's most illiquid stocks.</p>
<p>The company, the world's largest natural gas producer that supplies much of Europe, will use the receipts from the sale to help finance its 4,107 km Yamal-Europe gasline.</p>
<p>Global and American Depositary Receipts are share-lookalikes which allow foreign investors to buy into a company while avoiding domestic settlement problems in emerging markets.</p>
