<p>President Boris Yeltsin views U.S. missile raids on Iraq as &quot;very dangerous&quot; and is watching events carefully, chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chubais told a news conference that further air strikes would be &quot;impermissible&quot;, but that future Russian reaction would depend on how events unfolded.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is rather dramatic and we are following it attentively,&quot; he said. &quot;We consider it a political event which could be very dangerous,&quot; he said, making it clear he was expressing Yeltsin's opinion.</p>
<p>Russia, which has economic interests in Baghdad, has already reacted sharply to the raids, which the United States said were in retaliation for attacks on Kurdish regions of northern Iraq.</p>
<p>A government statement released on Tuesday said the U.S. strikes threatened Iraq's sovereignty and should be stopped.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, visiting Switzerland and Liechtenstein, has said Russia viewed the raids very negatively.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a system could lead to catastrophic consequences. I am speaking not only about regional affairs, but about the world order,&quot; Primakov said in the Liechtenstein capital Vaduz.</p>
<p>Chubais said the Russian foreign ministry had been consulted before the second set of strikes, and the foreign ministry had consulted the presidential administration.</p>
<p>&quot;We are following developments by the hour, and that is why we issued a government statement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has not been seen in public for weeks and has not reacted in public to the U.S. raids. Aides say he is keeping in close touch with affairs of state.</p>
