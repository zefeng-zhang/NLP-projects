<p> TIFFE Euroyen 3M (M)     99.24		   99.21</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The key June three-month Euroyen deposit rate futures contract on TIFFE ended Tuesday's day session higher in sympathy with soaring Japanese government bond (JGBs) futures, traders said.</p>
<p>The June hit 99.25 in the afternoon, a high for the June contract, following a jump in the key December JGB futures contract to 123.96, the highest for any benchmark JGB contract listed on the TSE.  </p>
<p>&quot;The underlying sentiment is strong due to higher JGBs. The market's perception is that a low interest rate environment will continue,&quot; said a trader at a Japanese city bank.</p>
<p>In the interbank call market, the key unsecured overnight rate was traded at 0.49 percent, up from 0.48 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan maintained a neutral stance in this morning's money market operation.</p>
<p>Demand for funds, however, remained strong, with traders citing private-sector salary payments as a factor causing market tightness.  </p>
<p>About 130 billion yen worth of the key three-month certificates of deposit (CDs) were issued at 0.52 percent, as were about 30 billion yen worth of one-month CDs at 0.49 percent.</p>
<p>Two-month CDs were offered at 0.50 percent. All rates were unchanged from Monday.</p>
<p>Interest rate swap (IRS) rates were lower following the JGB futures' rally. One-year IRS was at 0.61/65 percent, down from Monday's 0.63/67 percent. Two-year IRS was quoted at 0.92/96 percent, down from 0.96/1.00 percent on Monday.</p>
