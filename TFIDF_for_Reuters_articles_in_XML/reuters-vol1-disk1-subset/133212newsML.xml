<p>Since President Boris Yeltsin fell ill nearly four months ago, the most intriguing question for Kremlin watchers has been -- who rules Russia? There is no easy answer.</p>
<p>Kremlin troublemaker Alexander Lebed has been sacked. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is a low-key number two. The opposition points an accusing finger at Kremlin chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais, saying he has assumed the role of a regent.</p>
<p>But more and more often another name slips in among the influential figures behind the scenes -- Tatyana Dyachenko, the president's younger daughter.</p>
<p>Opponents and experts say that while Yeltsin is ill and awaiting a heart operation due next month, Tatyana has exerted some influence on affairs of state despite having no official position. Further hints of this emerged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Between the first and second round of the (presidential) election Yeltsin was not concerned with anything and did not want to be concerned,&quot; former Kremlin chief-of-staff Nikolai Yegorov said in a newspaper interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The only person to whose opinion he listened was his younger daughter Tatyana,&quot; Yegorov, who was sacked after Yeltsin's re-election last July, told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.</p>
<p>The liberal Sevodnya newspaper also saw a growing role for Tatyana, 36, behind the scenes.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering that the president will for the next three to four months be very occupied...the state is going into the joint control of the prime minister and the head of the presidential administration with Tatyana Dyachenko as an informal symbol of legitimate authority,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Many analysts see her hand, with others, in several recent sackings of Kremlin hardliners -- from Yegorov to Yeltsin's hawkish bodyguard, Alexander Korzhakov.</p>
<p>Yegorov, bitter over his sacking, joined the chorus of opponents who say Chubais and Tatyana are acting hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>&quot;They needed a person best positioned to influence Yeltsin. And she was the best candidate. They urged her -- &quot;It would be very good if Dad...' She would go and get the necessary decision,&quot; Yegorov said.</p>
<p>In his first presidential term, Yeltsin left his family out of the limelight, aware of the unfortunate experience of his Kremlin predecessor Mikhail Gorbachev, who brought his eloquent wife Raisa into public politics.</p>
<p>She did not go down well with the Russians and Gorbachev's popularity was damaged.</p>
<p>Both Yeltsin's wife Naina and Tatyana, a mother of two and a mathematician by education, have said they opposed his decision to run for a second term.</p>
<p>&quot;No one knows how much time fate has given you and I would have liked my father to live for himself, to spend time with friends, grandchildren and children,&quot; she said in a newspaper interview last June.</p>
<p>But once Yeltsin made his choice, the family rallied round to help and Tatyana became invaluable. The family even appeared on stage beside Yeltsin at one election rally.</p>
<p>On Yeltsin's request, Tatyana joined his election team and, although not publicly, backed Chubais against the hardliners.</p>
<p>She travelled with Yeltsin during the election campaign, drawing comparisons with the role played by French President Jacques Chirac's daughter Claude.</p>
<p>Tatyana was credited with softening the president's image, making him more appealing to women voters. But her influence appeared to go far beyond this and many top Kremlin aides said she should remain in the presidential team after the election.</p>
<p>She rarely appears in public on behalf of Yeltsin. But recently she visited schoolchildren injured in a horrific bus crash in which many were killed. She toured a hospital where the injured were being treated, carrying off the trip with aplomb.</p>
<p>Although she has no official role, many anlaysts say this does not diminish her influence, especially as Yeltsin's links with the Krmelin have been restricted since he disappered from public view just before the second round of the election.</p>
<p>Tatyana's elder son, the 15-year-old Boris, studies in Britain. Gleb, name chosen by the president, was born last year.</p>
