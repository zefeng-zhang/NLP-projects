<p>U.S. stocks were hit by waves of high-tech sector selling, sending the Nasdaq Composite to its biggest point loss in a month as Digital disappointed and Microsoft earnings, while solid, were not a blowout.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has run out of steam. Yesterday was the tip-off when IBM had good earnings and the stock rocketed up and then fell apart. Then we had Microsoft. Not helping today was Digital with its big loss,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials lost 29 to about 6062.  </p>
<p>The tech-studded Nasdaq Composite shed 17 points, or a stiffer 1.34 percent, to about 1220. It was the largest point loss since September 5's 18.16 point drop.</p>
<p>Losers outpaced gainers 15-9 on heavy NYSE volume of about 411 million shares.</p>
<p>Equities were pressured by losses in the Treasuries market, with the long bond off 18/32 to yield 6.85 percent.</p>
<p>But stiff selling in technology and managed care issues led the market lower. Digital slumped 5-3/8 to 29 after reporting a wider than expected first-quarter loss of $0.48 a share. The First Call consensus was a $0.14 per share loss.  </p>
<p>Cowen downgraded Digital to neutral from buy.</p>
<p>Microsoft lost 1-1/2 to 132-1/2 after reporting that quarterly results rose to $0.95 a share, topping the consensus estimate by a nickel. But some traders were hoping for an even better blowout number from the software giant.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of technology earnings have met expectations and in some cases were better than expected. But that's already in the price. Profit-taking will continue for the next week or so right into the U.S. elections. We might get to the 5900 level before the profit-taking runs its course,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research of Westfalia Investments.  </p>
<p>Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James, said: &quot;A lot of damage was done in Nasdaq today&quot; but noted it has had a &quot;terrific rally.&quot; Since bottoming in mid-July, the Dow is up 13 percent, the S&amp;P 500 is up 12.4 percent and the Nasdaq Composite is up 15.8 percent.</p>
<p>He said it was troublesome when &quot;they don't rally the stocks on good news and take them behind the barn on bad news and shoot them. The market celebrated the upside. It has used up an incredible amount of firepower from the mid-July low.&quot;</p>
<p>HMOs were another hard-hit sector, with the Morgan Stanley healthcare payor index off 2.28 percent to 203.  </p>
<p>Industry analysts cited investor nervousness about third-quarter earnings. Oxford Health lost 3-1/8 to 41-1/4, bellwether United Health shed 1-3/4 to 36-3/4, PacifiCare Health Systems lost 2-15/16 to 68-5/16 and FHP International fell 1/2 to 35-1/4.</p>
<p>Among technology stocks, IBM shed three to 127, Intel was off 2-1/4 to 105-1/2, Sun Microsystems lost 1-3/16 to 59-1/8, while Motorola was unchaned at 48-1/4.</p>
<p>Among special situations, Medaphis tumbled 6-3/8 to 10-3/8 after reporting a much wider third-quarter pro forma loss.  </p>
<p>The billing and accounts receivable management services company also plans to restate results for the quarter and year ended December 1995, resulting in a wider loss than previously reported due to a certain license agreement.</p>
<p>GM rose 3/4 to 54-5/8. The Canadian Auto Workers union said GM dropped its demand for a mandatory overtime rule at an Ontario plant, paving the way for a pact that would end a 19-day strike by 26,000 auto workers at GM's Canadian plants.</p>
<p>Salomon Inc lost 3-1/4 to 45-3/8 after reporting a drop in third-quarter earnings, well below the Street's consensus. Its Phibro unit will stop coal, coke and fertilizer trading.  </p>
<p>Compuware surged five to 52-1/4 after reporting stronger earnings. Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock.</p>
<p>Several major U.S. pharmaceutical companies reported third quarter results that were either in-line or above Wall Street expectations, driven by strong demand for high-margin new drugs. Bristol-Myers Co Squibb, up 2-3/4 to 106-7/8, and Warner-Lambert Co, off 7/8 to 65-1/4, topped consensus earnings forecasts, while American Home Products, off 1/2 to 65-7/8, and Eli Lilly, up 1/2 to 69-1/4, matched expectations.</p>
<p>Ontrack Data International, a data recovery company, rose 2-1/2 to 14-1/2 in its first day of trading.  </p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite fell 16.41 to 1220.00.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 3.28 to 706.57.</p>
