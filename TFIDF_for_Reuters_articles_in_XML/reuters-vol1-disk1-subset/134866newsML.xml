<p>A man wielding a knife was overpowered by police and taken into custody on Tuesday after threatening to stab himself to death in a bizarre protest at the U.S. stand at a Paris international food fair.</p>
<p>A large crowd quickly gathered after the middle-aged man ripped off his jacket, pointed a knife at his chest and said he would kill himself unless fair officials let him show a video said to detail unspecified abuses by a U.S. soft drinks maker.</p>
<p>&quot;I will kill myself and you will be responsible,&quot; he shouted at staff running the stand.</p>
<p>&quot;They are killing children,&quot; he said, speaking in English with a central European accent.</p>
<p>A hostess at the U.S. stand said the man had approached her to ask for the number of another stand at the sprawling Paris exhibition hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he started throwing around videocassettes and shouting,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>Police and plainclothes officers quickly sealed off the area and, about half an hour later, overpowered the man. No one was injured in the incident and the man's identity was not immediately known.</p>
