<title>USA: Spending on new construction fell sharply in July.</title>
<headline>Spending on new construction fell sharply in July.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Builders trimmed their spending on new projects sharply in July to the slowest pace in five months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Total spending on private and public-sector construction dropped 1.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $554.7 billion after a revised 0.7 percent June rise.</p>
<p>It was the biggest monthly drop since a 2.6 percent decline in February and also brought the spending rate to the lowest since February, when it was running at $544.6 billion a year.</p>
<p>Weaker construction spending in July may offset some concern fanned by recent reports suggesting the economy carried so much momentum into the second half that it might not slow down fast enough to ward off interest-rate rises by the Federal Reserve aimed at controlling inflation.</p>
<p>Economists have been busily revising odds of a Fed rate increase as soon as its next meeting three weeks from now on Sept. 24 as a stream of strong economic data flowed in.</p>
<p>The government revised up its estimate of second-quarter expansion in gross domestic product to an annual rate of 4.8 percent a year from 4.2 percent. A private-sector report from the National Association of Purchasing Management on Tuesday showed manufacturing industries adding strength in August.</p>
<p>The signs of economic vigour -- rather than a slowdown as the Fed prefers to brake wage and price pressures -- focused attention on Friday's scheduled August employment report that economists said could be the touchstone for the U.S. central bank policymakers when they consider whether interest rates need to be raised.</p>
<p>Current forecasts project the Labour Department announcing 244,000 new jobs were created in August on top of 193,000 in July. Any figure above the forecast would certainly aggravate inflation fears because labour markets are relatively tight.</p>
<p>A survey by Reuters this week of 30 economists found 16 predicted policymaking members of the Federal Open Market Committee would announce an increase in short-term rates following their Sept. 24 meeting.</p>
<p>The construction spending report showed weaker outlays across the board, affecting both privately and publicly financed projects, from new homes and offices to sewer systems and conservation projects.</p>
<p>In addition, the increase in June construction spending was revised to a smaller gain of 0.7 percent instead of the 1.2 percent gain the department estimated a month ago.</p>
<p>Privately financed construction spending dropped 1.6 percent in July to a rate of $415.4 billion following a 1.1 percent June increase. Spending on public, or taxpayer financed projects, was down 0.9 percent in July after a 0.5 percent June decrease.</p>
<p>Among private projects, spending for new housing fell 1.6 percent to a rate of $174.7 billion, the biggest monthly drop since a 2.4 percent fall in May 1995, the department said.</p>
<p>A separate report on Wednesday from the economic research firm BTM/Schroder reported a modest 1.3 percent pickup last week in sales at chain stores from the preceding week.</p>
<p>&quot;The back-to-school sales performance was decent during (August),&quot; the survey said.</p>
