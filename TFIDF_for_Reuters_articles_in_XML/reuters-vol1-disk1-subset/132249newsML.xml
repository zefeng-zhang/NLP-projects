<p>Vendex International NV said on Monday it had made a book profit of 130 million guilders on the sale of its 36 percent sale in fellow retail group Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer NV (KBB).  </p>
<p>Vendex said 3.76 million shares had been placed with Dutch and foreign institutional investors at a price of 117 guilders per share. A further 500,000 shares held by Vendex were sold to KBB at the same price.</p>
<p>The net proceeds of the deal for Vendex amounted to 484 million guilders.</p>
<p>Prior to the deal there had been 11.8 million KBB shares issued and outstanding.  </p>
<p>Vendex announced plans to sell its 36 percent stake in KBB on October 8, but it was forced to review the plans after KBB issued a profit warning, triggering a sharp fall in KBB shares.</p>
<p>KBB's share price fell from around 146 guilders at the time of the original Vendex announcement to just over 120 guilders last week, following KBB's warning that this year's net profit from ordinary operations would be much lower than last year's.  </p>
<p>Vendex said today that it had decided to go ahead with the plan despite the lower share price because a lengthy postponement would have kept KBB's share price under pressure for a sustained period.</p>
<p>It said it had also decided to press ahead with the sale to avoid any misunderstanding about its strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Vendex said on October 8 it was selling off the KBB stake, acquired in the 1970s, because it no longer regarded it as a strategic holding. Analysts have suggested that Vendex will use the proceeds to expand its business service operations which include temporary employment agencies and office cleaning.</p>
