<p>Russian consumer prices fell in August for the first time since economic reforms began in 1992, official figures showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The state statistics committee said prices fell 0.2 percent in August, after a rise of 0.7 percent in July.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation for August is not yet available, but the committee said consumer prices had risen 16.1 percent since the start of the year.</p>
<p>If the current negative price trend continued, annual inflation could be as low as 15 percent, it said. Consumer prices rose 131 percent year-on-year in December 1995.</p>
<p>Russian prices rises are traditionally lower in summer due to lower food prices. But the decline will be welcome news to a government under pressure on other economic fronts.</p>
<p>Tax collection is running well behind schedule and the government will face a tough battle to get its tight 1997 budget through a parliament dominated by communists and other conservatives.</p>
<p>The budget envisages a deficit of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, after a forecast 3.85 percent gap this year.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund postponed handing over the July tranche of a three-year $10 billion loan to Russia because of concern about Moscow's ability to meet the 1996 budget.</p>
<p>But the money was handed over last month and the IMF is expected to approve the August tranche of the loan soon.</p>
<p>Officials working with the Russian finance ministry say the IMF also revised upward its target for the Russian budget deficit to 5.25 percent of gross domestic product, from 4 percent.</p>
<p>Russia and the IMF use different methodology to calculate the budget deficit.</p>
