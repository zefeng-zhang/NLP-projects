<p>The special envoy appointed to sell America's anti-Cuba trade laws to the rest of the world called on Wednesday for U.S. allies to join &quot;a first, genuine, multinational effort&quot; to bring democracy to Havana.</p>
<p>Stuart Eizenstat told Reuters he was not attempting to justify the controversial Helms-Burton Act but rather coordinate and focus international opposition to Fidel Castro's government.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't stop the opposition (to the act),&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;But what I am asking for is more effort, more willingness, more desire to bring democracy to what is the last truly oppressive regime in the Western hemisphere.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizenstat, who until earlier this year was Washington's ambassador to the EU, was in Belgium to outline new U.S. proposals to the European Union which -- along with Canada and Mexico -- has led opposition to the act.</p>
<p>Among other things, the act allows American citizens to sue in U.S. courts foreign companies that have benefited from investments made in property confiscated by Havana since the Cuban revolution of 1959.</p>
<p>The practical implications of this part have been suspended until next year but Eizenstat said Clinton would willingly suspend it further if Washington's allies joined U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba.</p>
<p>The EU has already outlined what reprisals it plans to take regardless of a future suspension.</p>
<p>These are to forbid European individuals or companies to comply with any U.S. court action; allow them to counter-sue to recover any damages awarded; prohibit individuals from litigant U.S. companies from travelling to the EU; and compile a &quot;watch list&quot; of American companies or individuals involved in any litigation.</p>
<p>The EU has also to decide whether to escalate a dispute on the matter lodged with the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>The new U.S. proposals are aimed at co-ordinating international activity at government, non-government and private sector level to ensure aid and assistance to Cuba helps the people rather than the government.</p>
<p>He said these proposals had been received favourably by all he had spoken to during his tour, which so far has included Canada and Mexico and will also take in Germany, Spain, France, Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Eizenstat said Washington had no &quot;10 Commandments&quot; for the rest of the world to observe before it would consider further suspending the act.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not saying what must be done and what must not be done,&quot; he said. &quot;We are seeking cooperation for what can be a genuine multinational effort to bring change.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that there had been a great deal of misunderstanding surrounding the act.</p>
<p>Denying that the U.S. administration was seeking to make an example of high-profile companies trading with Cuba, he said the legislation aimed to target specific &quot;traffickers&quot; and only after careful and painstaking research.</p>
<p>Companies doing business with Cuba had &quot;every opportunity&quot; to check if they might be investing in property confiscated from U.S. citizens, he added.</p>
