<title>NEW ZEALAND: INL may face legal challenge to Sky deal.</title>
<headline>INL may face legal challenge to Sky deal.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>Hutt Valley and Kapiti pay TV operator Saturn Communications would consider a legal challenge to any entry by Independent Newspapers Ltd into Sky Network Television, Saturn chief executive Jack Matthews told the New Zealand Press Association on Monday.</p>
<p>Saturn last year joined forces with Clear Communications and TV3 to prevent Telecom buying a 25 percent stake in Sky which owned by Telecom parents Bell Atlantic and Ameritech.  </p>
<p>Telecom backed away from buying the holding after the three objectors were granted an interim injunction preventing it. The trio was subsequently granted another injunction preventing another deal which would have given Telecom's pay TV operations, currently being trialled in two centres, access to Sky programming.</p>
<p>INL announced on Friday that it was negotiating with shareholders owning more than 80 percent of Sky. Media baron Rupert Murdoch's News Corp owns 49.5 percent of INL.  </p>
<p>Clear Communications chief executive Andrew Makin today said he had no objection to INL taking a stake in Sky, and looked forward to doing business with Sky if INL became a shareholder.</p>
<p>TV3 managing director Graeme Hunter said too little detail was known of a possible deal to form any conclusions, although TV3 would look to negotiating for any free-to-air programming rights if they were held by Sky.</p>
<p>However, Matthews told NZPA Saturn would be looking at the situation &quot;particularly as it relates to Commerce Act implications&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;You've got a company coming in, News Corp, that has a great capacity for vertical integration and exclusive programming arrangements that are not contestable,&quot; Matthews said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the practical reality is that anyone is going to come in and engage in anti-competitive behaviour to leverage Sky's dominance and enhance that dominance through vertically integrated programming deals, then we are going to have a big problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Matthews said there were many similarities between the now-thwarted deal between Telecom and Sky deal and the proposed INL and Sky deal.  </p>
<p>INL managing director Mike Robson said last week that if INL's plans to buy Sky went ahead the deal would not need the approval of the Commerce Commission.</p>
<p>Matthews said that while Telecom offered distribution and financial clout, News Corp's strength lay in financial muscle and programming.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, it may be that the programming clout is more substantial than the distribution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's early days, we really don't have a formal opinion other than we are concerned and we are looking at it.&quot;  </p>
<p>Saturn, which operates on the Kapiti Coast and in the Hutt Valley has 3000 customers, and is currently rolling out fibre-optic cable to link up more phones.</p>
<p>It also plans to get into local service telephone services.</p>
<p>Although much larger, Matthews said Sky has probably peaked in terms of market penetration and faced a bill of more than $250 million to upgrade its five channels to deliver the multiple channels other entrants were offering.</p>
<p>&quot;As five channel service, I think they've got a limited shelf life,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In calendar 1995 Sky lost $9.8 million, and it has negative shareholders' funds of $52.6 million.</p>
<p>However, Matthews said current year profitability may have improved due to Sky's rights to the rugby union.</p>
