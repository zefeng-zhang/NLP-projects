<p>Blue-chip stocks roared back from a deep sell-off to end on a strong note Tuesday, propelled by big gains in oil company stocks after U.S. military strikes on Iraqi targets lifted oil prices to four-month highs.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 32.18 points at 5,648.39 after being down more than 50 points in the first minutes of the session as investors worried about higher interest rates and news of the U.S. action against Iraq.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,392 to 1,015 on trading of 333 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts warned, however, that the market's recovery masked continued uncertainty about interest rates, noting that most of the Dow index's strength came from oil stocks.</p>
<p>The rebound in stocks began with release of the National Association of Purchasing Management index of manufacturing activity for August.</p>
<p>The index, which rose to 52.6 from 50.2 in July, showed gains in the manufacturing sector but fell short of Wall Street's forecasts for a 52.9 reading, leaving unsettled the timing and magnitude of any future action on interest rates by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>&quot;After NAPM, which was generally in line with forecasts, you can still make a case both ways,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;It left markets with reason to believe the Fed will move and reason to believe it won't.&quot;</p>
<p>Late in the session, stocks were given another boost from a report by Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc., a firm that tracks the retailing business, that retail sales rose just 0.8 percent in August compared to July.</p>
<p>The tame growth surprised analysts, who had expected more of a jump due to back-to-school sales.</p>
<p>The news sparked rise in bonds. The 30-year Treasury bond rose nearly three-quarters of a point and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slumped to 7.06 percent from 7.12 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Oil stocks were the session's standouts, as the sector reacted to the leap in crude oil after the U.S. bombed military targets in Iraq in retaliation for weekend attacks on internationally-protected Kurdish zones.</p>
<p>Texaco Inc. rose 3-1/8 to 91-7/8, Exxon Corp. gained 2-1/4 to 83-3/4 and Mobil Corp. was up 2-3/8 to 115-3/8.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices closed up $1.15 at $23.40 after earlier rising as high as $24.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>The spike in oil prices boded ill for energy-hungry sectors, however, and sent the Dow Jones Transportation index tumbling 19.12 points to 2025.26.</p>
<p>&quot;Oil stocks turned the market positive, but with higher oil prices come tougher times for the Transports,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.</p>
<p>Particularly hard-hit were airlines, with Delta Air Lines Inc. down 2 to 68-7/8, United Airlines parent company UAL Corp. off 1/2 to 47-1/2 and USAir Group Inc. down 1/2 to 17-3/8.</p>
<p>In yet another sign of increasing unease on Wall Street, Dean Witter Reynolds said it was reducing its asset allocation model's exposure to stocks and bonds during what the firm's chief investment strategist Peter Canelo said promises to be an extended period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Canelo said interest rate concerns were the primary reason for raising cash in the model. Stocks now represent 55 percent of the Dean Witter model, down from 60 percent and bonds account for 20 percent, down from 25 percent.</p>
<p>Cash was increased to 25 percent from 15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is this period of uncertainty could last more than a week,&quot; Canelo said.</p>
<p>Among individual issues, Intel Corp. rose 1-13/16 to 81-5/8 after Robertson Stephens raised its earnings estimates on the company for 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.79 to 1,142.29.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.73 to 654.72. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.89 to 557.79.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.77 to 351.76. The average share was up 9 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,444.684 up 10.658 or 0.17 percent.</p>
