<headline>Morgan Stanley's Gros - Brazil cenbank clears him.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Morgan Stanley Group Inc executive said Tuesday he was ready to pay for losses incurred during his term as administrator at a failed Brazilian bank, but said the central bank had cleared him of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Fransisco Gros, managing director of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co, said Brazil's central bank had held the administrators of BFC Banco responsible for financial losses but had found no irregularities during his tenure at the bank, which was liquidated in December 1995.  </p>
<p>A Brazilian judge on Monday ordered the blockage of Gros' assets in Brazil and said the request to freeze the commercial bank and brokerage accounts came from the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The judge is trying to do his job but (the decision) is based on a clear misreading to the central bank's final report,&quot; Gros told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gros, who still retains shares of BFC Banco that constituted 11 percent of total shares, acted as an administrator at the bank in June 1990-May 1991 and April 1993 -December 1993.  He had left BFC in May 1991 to serve as president of Brazil's central bank.  </p>
<p>The central bank report found BFC administrators responsible for losses of about 958,000 reias ($931,000) during Gros's terms as an official, compared with total losses of about 73 million reias ($71.5 million), Gros said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready and willing to stand and answer for any damage,&quot; Gros said. &quot;If it is my responsibility, then I am willing and able to take care of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley executive said authorities would need to determine whether to hold bank administrators responsible on a collective or individual basis.  </p>
<p>Gros also said he had not been given an opportunity to defend himself in the court before the judge's order, and added that he intended to respond aggressively to the decision through legal action.</p>
