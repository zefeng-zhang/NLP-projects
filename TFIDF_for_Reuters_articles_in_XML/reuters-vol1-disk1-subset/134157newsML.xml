<p>The State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) devalued the rupee 7.86 percent against the dollar on Tuesday in what was seen as part of an IMF-approved economic rescue package.</p>
<p>The SBP lowered the value of the rupee to 40.1200/40.3206 to the dollar from 36.9700/37.1549 fixed on September 10, when a small downward adjustment took place.</p>
<p>There was no immediate official explanation for the sweeping devaluation. SBP governor Muhammad Yaqub was due to hold a news conference in Karachi at 1030 GMT (1530 local) and an SBP spokesman said he would outline the economic reform package.</p>
<p>The government has agreed with the International Monetary Fund on a series of stabilisation measures to cut Pakistan's budget deficit and bridge its yawning current account deficit.</p>
<p>The package, not yet announced, is expected to include harsh spending cuts and imposition of an agricultural income tax.</p>
<p>An IMF mission is due to arrive in Pakistan on Thursday for a review of the economy that must be completed before the fund can release more money from a stalled $600 million standby loan.</p>
<p>Pakistan's foreign reserves, excluding gold, stood at $1.13 billion in September, compared with $1.52 billion a year earlier, but had sunk to $831 million by October 3, SBP figures show.</p>
<p>The devaluation, which had been expected despite repeated SBP denials that any major adjustment was imminent, drew immediate criticism from bankers and analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a concerted economic policy. Actually there is no economic policy,&quot; said a Lahore-based foreign banker, who asked not be named. &quot;The devaluation will have no long- or short-term benefit because it will not spur any export growth.&quot;</p>
<p>He said devaluation was useful only in countries which have unutilised industrial capacity, which was not Pakistan's case.</p>
<p>A foreign banker in Karachi said the action was in line with government attempts to keep Pakistani exports competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation running close to 10 percent and a high trade deficit, plus a strong dollar in the international markets must be the reasons behind the massive devaluation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The banker, who asked not to be named, said the rupee had lost 17.14 percent of its dollar value since January 1 and 14.3 percent since the beginning of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June).</p>
<p>&quot;It's a disaster. The benefits are hard to see,&quot; said an Islamabad-based stocks analyst, adding that Pakistani exports and imports had not responded much to past devaluations.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't affect exports, relieve the debt burden or add to reserves, but will push up fuel prices and power tariffs.&quot;</p>
<p>The analyst said stock prices were likely to fall because the devaluation would raise industrial costs, though the scrips of energy, fertiliser and fuel marketing companies might rise.</p>
<p>Karachi dealers said the sharp devaluation would send a shock wave to investors, prompting them to stay out for now.</p>
<p>The Karachi 100-share index fell 4.34 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 1,363.26 on Monday.</p>
