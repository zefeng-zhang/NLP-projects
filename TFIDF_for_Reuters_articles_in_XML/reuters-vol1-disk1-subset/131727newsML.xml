<title>FRANCE: Arthuis-Pension fund payouts should be annuities.</title>

<text>
<p>French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Monday that pension funds to be introduced next year should make payouts in annuities rather than lump sums.</p>
<p>In an interview with financial daily l'Agefi, he also said the introduction of pension funds would favour investment in shares, bolster company share capital and reduce the need for cross-shareholdings in French companies.</p>
<p>Arthuis said the main aim of introducing pension funds was to complement the existing system of universal pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the reason why I favour payouts in annuities, which will allow the subscriber to have a regular extra income at retirement age, and which will favour long-term investment,&quot; he said in the interview with l'Agefi.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe has suggested that there could be an option to choose to take money out in a lump sum.</p>
<p>French banks have pushed for pension funds to be able to pay out money in a lump sum, whereas insurance companies want the payout to be in the form of annuities.</p>
<p>The National Assembly is due to hold a debate on introducing pension funds this autumn.</p>
<p>But in a snub to Arthuis, whose ministry drew up detailed proposals on pension funds, parliament will debate not his proposals, but a bill drawn up in 1994 by then parliamentary deputies Jacques Barrot, Charles Millon and Jean-Pierre Thomas,</p>
<p>Arthuis said pension fund managers would naturally invest in shares, generally recognised to be more productive over the long term. This in turn would boost corporate share capital.</p>
<p>&quot;The appearance of cross-shareholdings in privatisations, when these do not correspond to a need for a strong strategic partner, has been partly due to insufficient corporate share capital,&quot; he said. &quot;Retirement funds investing in shares will ease this constraint.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent privatisations had shown that the construction of cross-shareholders were not essential, he said.</p>
<p>Discussion about the introduction of pension funds is being closely watched by financial markets, interested to see whether it would affect the allocation of assets between stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Arthuis's proposals do not suggest fixing a minimum for investment in shares or bonds, which finance ministry sources say they do not believe to be necessary as long as payouts are in annuities.</p>
<p>The National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, has not yet fixed a date for its debate on pension funds, but may do so on Tuesday at a meeting of heads of parliamentary parties.</p>
<p>Arthuis is expected to try to amend the draft bill during the parliamentary debate to bring it back to his own original proposals. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 42 21 53 81</p>
