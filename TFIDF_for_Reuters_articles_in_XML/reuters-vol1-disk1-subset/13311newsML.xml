<p>A gas pipeline explosion killed two teenagers and forced 50 families to evacuate their homes in a small Texas town Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>The two 17-year-old victims, a boy and a girl, smelled liquid butane gas leaking from a pipeline in the town of Lively and jumped into their truck to warn people but their vehicle exploded in flames, apparently because of an ignition spark.</p>
<p>Police said the pipeline was shut off but gas was still burning and would continue to do so for several hours.</p>
<p>One home was destroyed and 50 others were evacuated. The residents were put up in shelters in and around Lively, which lies about 40 miles (60 km) southeast of Dallas.</p>
