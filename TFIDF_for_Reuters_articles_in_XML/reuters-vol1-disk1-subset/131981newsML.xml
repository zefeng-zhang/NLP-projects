<p>Japanese traders said on Monday they would buy U.S. corn this week before the trans-Pacific freight rate firms further in the near term, but a backlog of grain vessels at local ports may slow their buying pace.</p>
<p>In Seoul, Korean flour millers said they expected to buy one or two cargoes of U.S. wheat for January/February shipment, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The freight rates jumped up late last week and some feed makers entered the corn market,&quot; a major trade house official said. Nearby freight rates on the U.S. Gulf/Japan route were quoted at US$22.50 to $23 a tonne.</p>
<p>Local feed makers overbought U.S. corn for July/September shipment, and some ports are now facing backlogs of grain vessels, the traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some vessels are forced to wait for more than 20 days to unload corn at local ports. This may make some feed makers cautious,&quot; another corn trader said.  </p>
<p>Japanese importers have bought up to 80 percent of their January/March requirement for U.S. corn, with premiums at 98 to 99 U.S. cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) March futures contract, the traders said.</p>
<p>Japanese importers are currently buying U.S. soybean for December shipment with premiums at 120 U.S. cents a bushel on the CBOT January futures contract, the traders said.</p>
<p>A highlight of this week is a Chinese soybean mission expected to discuss export contracts for the first half of calendar 1997 with Japanese buyers, they said.  </p>
<p>Officials from the Chinese grain agency Cereals Oils and Feedstuffs Import and Export Corp and Heilongjiang province, which grows most of China's soybeans, will arrive in Tokyo on October 23 and leave October 30.</p>
<p>Chinese soybeans are mainly used for making miso, or bean paste, in Japan.</p>
<p>The delegation was originally scheduled to visit Japan in July, but delayed that because output figures for this year's harvest were not available yet, industry officials said.  </p>
<p>South Korean buyers, on the other hand, will concentrate mostly on buying wheat while remaining on the sidelines of the corn market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;This week, there may be some wheat buyers who will cover their January shipment needs. It will be one or two cargoes of U.S. wheat,&quot; a trader with Cheiljedang Corp said.</p>
<p>Local corn buyers would probably hold back purchases on the belief that prices were expected to fall further, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nobody can say where is the bottom of recent corn price. But we expect corn prices to fall further,&quot; a local corn trader said.&quot;We think there is no buyer who wants to move until he confirms the price is at the bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>Corn is expected to go below $2.80 per bushel on the December CBOT contract, traders said. The December CBOT contract closed on Friday three U.S. cents down at $2.80-1/4 a bushel.</p>
<p>Taiwanese buyers may tender for up to 200,000 tonnes of soybeans and 70,000 tonnes of corn from the United States in the next two weeks, traders said.  </p>
