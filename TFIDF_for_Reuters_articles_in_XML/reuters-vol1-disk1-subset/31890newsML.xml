<p>North Star Resources NL will continue to pursue approval to mine in Vietnam despite failure to reach an agreement with Robert Friedland's Indochina Goldfields Ltd over combining the Vietnamese assets of both companies, a North Star official told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The agreement would have joined all of Indochina's mineral resource assets in Vietnam, which includes its investment and mining license for the the Bong Mieu gold mining project and other large exploration acreage with the Sin Quyen copper and gold project, owned by North Star.  </p>
<p>North Star announced earlier on Wednesday that a deadline to merge the assets had passed without a final agreement.</p>
<p>North Star's company secretary, Phil MacLeod, said the company would continue to press for investment and mining licenses from the Vietnamese government to develop Sin Quyen without Indochina. &quot;We're still involved in Vietnam,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With a grading of 0.91 percent copper and 0.44 grams of gold a tonne, the deposit is arguably the largest undeveloped defined resource of its type in South-East Asia, North Star has said.</p>
<p>Indochina's activities in Vietnam are concentrated on the Bong Mieu Gold Mine and surrounding areas.  </p>
<p>Indochina president Edward Flood told Reuters earlier that the merger of assets with North Star was only one of several deals Indochina was looking at in Vietnam and that there would be no material impact on Indochina's overall operations.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Indochina has conducted an exploration programme on Bong Mieu to delineate a low cost, open pit gold mine.</p>
<p>During 1995 a drill programme was completed that delineated a geologic resource of 6.1 million tonnes containing over 400,000 ounces of gold.  </p>
<p>Friedland, the founder of Diamond Fields Resources Inc, which discovered the giant Voisey's Bay nickel deposit in Canada, is chairman of Indochina, which is pursuing mining projects throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
