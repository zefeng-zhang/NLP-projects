<title>UK: European, Asian lifters ready to drop Yemeni crude.</title>

<p>Term lifters of Yemeni crude have said they would be ready to drop fourth quarter contracts if official prices are not lowered, trading sources in Europe and Asia said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not happy with their numbers. They have issued their official selling price but that means nothing. They can go lower,&quot; a London-based trader said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A European oil company said on Tuesday it too would drop fourth quarter Yemeni crude from its shopping list unless the Yemenis agreed to lower prices. It would reconsider its position in the first quarter of next year, a company trader said.</p>
<p>The most recent sales of Masila crude in the spot market have been at steep discounts of up to 15 cents to the official selling price.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to press for lower prices,&quot; one term lifter said. &quot;If Yemen does not cut prices from the third quarter, we will do without Yemeni crude.&quot;</p>
<p>Most Asian term buyers said they would also drop fourth quarter contracts if prices were not lowered.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Yemen said it had rolled over its official fourth quarter Masila crude price to maintain it at Dated Brent minus 45 cents.</p>
<p>The price of Marib Light crude for the fourth quarter was also rolled over at Dated Brent flat, Yemen's Supreme Council for Economy and Oil Affairs said in a statement.</p>
<p>Buyers said they wanted Masila to be lowered to a price ranging between Dated Brent minus 55 cents and minus 65 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Even with Masila priced at Dated Brent minus 55 cents, the economics are not good,&quot; a trader said. &quot;We are not afraid of terminating our contract.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said they may choose to revive contracts for the first quarter of 1997, depending on prices.</p>
<p>They said Masila crude was difficult to sell in Asia because the price is linked to Brent and not crudes such as Oman and Dubai, which are regarded as benchmarks in Asia.</p>
<p>Brent-linked crudes lose competitiveness in Asia when the price of Brent rises in comparison to Oman and Dubai.</p>
<p>The London-based traders said the widening Brent/Dubai spread -- which ballooned to over $2.00 for November on Wednesday -- made a rollover from the third quarter hard to swallow.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers don't make sense. Dubai has moved out and on the numbers it doesn't make any sense,&quot; one trader said.</p>
