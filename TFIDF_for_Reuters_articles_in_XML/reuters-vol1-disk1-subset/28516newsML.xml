<p>Toyota Motor Corp. raised the stakes in the competitive market for mid-sized cars Tuesday by announcing price cuts of up to 4 percent on its all-new 1997 Camry.</p>
<p>The manufacturer's suggested price of a base four-cylinder CE Camry with manual transmission is now $16,818, including delivery charges of $420, down 2 percent from the sticker price on an entry-level 1996 Camry.</p>
<p>The new price is also almost $200 below the $18,545 base price of a rival 1997 Taurus G from Ford Motor Co., although the Taurus comes with an automatic transmission and a six-cylinder engine.</p>
<p>The Japanese automaker also dropped sticker prices on its top-of-the-line Camry XLE V6 by 4 percent, to $24,438 from $25,458.</p>
<p>Toyota's average 1997 model year prices on a comparably equipped basis will rise 0.7 percent, or $135, from the 1996 year, not including the Camry or Supra prices. The division had no mid-year price hikes during the 1996 model year.</p>
<p>Toyota's prices, taking advantage of a weaker Japanese yen that makes it cheaper to produce vehicles in Japan, are below those of Detroit's Big Three for the upcoming model year, which formally begins Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Ford hiked prices an average of 1.2 percent. General Motors Corp. prices rose 1.7 percent, while Chrysler Corp. boosted its prices an average of 1.9 percent.</p>
<p>George Magliano, an analyst with the WEFA Group, a New York-based industry consultant, said the new Camry prices will shake things up in the mid-size car market and have a ripple effect in the less expensive compact market as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is going to have to go along with this,&quot; he said. &quot;It's going to have to be met in the marketplace. This is too big a deal and too aggressive a price move just to pass off.&quot;</p>
<p>The conservative styling of Toyota's all-new Camry shows the Japanese automaker is moving in the opposite direction of the ultra-curved Taurus, which Ford designed with unique oval headlights and rear window.</p>
<p>While Ford loaded its new Taurus, introduced a year ago, with expensive options, Toyota officials stressed the new Camry's price value.</p>
<p>&quot;Dramatic improvements in design, engineering and manufacturing have allowed us to offer our customers great Toyota value at a very competitive price,&quot; Toyota Division general manager David Illingworth said in a statement.</p>
<p>Toyota said, however, it raised prices on its popular new sport utility vehicles. The 4Runner now starts at $21,208, up 2 percent, and the RAV4 starts at $16,588, a rise of 1.1 percent.</p>
