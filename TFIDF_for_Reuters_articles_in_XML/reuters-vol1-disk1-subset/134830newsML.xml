<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Tuesday an incident between President Jacques Chirac and Israeli security men in Jerusalem should not overshadow Chirac's peace mission to the Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;There were incidents today in Jerusalem's Old City caused by the excessive zeal of the security forces,&quot; Juppe told parliament after Chirac angrily elbowed his way through a tight wall formed around him by Israeli security men as he toured the city's Arab sector.</p>
<p>Juppe told the National Assembly at question time that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had apologised for the incident during which Chirac threatened to call off the Israeli leg of his current Middle East tour.</p>
<p>&quot;But these incidents should not make us forget the most important aspect, the message of peace and friendship for all the peoples of the region which the president went to express in Jerusalem and in the Arab states...</p>
<p>&quot;These incidents must not make us forget that the main point involved is a message of peace and fraternity,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>He echoed Chirac's call, made several times during the current tour, that Europe should have a role in Middle East peacemaking and there could be no security in the region without full peace.</p>
