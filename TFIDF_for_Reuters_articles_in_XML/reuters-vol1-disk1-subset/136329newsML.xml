<p>Canadian Pacific Railway said on Wednesday it agreed to sell 1,143 miles (1,839 km) of its Midwestern U.S. rail lines to Montana-based Washington Organisation.</p>
<p>The sale includes some equipment such as freight cars, locomotives and track equipment. Canadian Pacific declined to divulge the price of the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in early 1997.</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific, a Calgary, Alberta-based unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd., of Montreal, said the sale was part of its plan announced in August to rationalise about one-quarter of its Canada and U.S. rail network.</p>
<p>Candian Pacific, one of Canada's two national railroad operators, said that under the proposed agreement it will sell a 513-mile (826 km) line between Chicago and Kansas City, including a branch line into southern Wisconsin. It will also sell 630 miles (1,1013 km) of track in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota.</p>
<p>The rail lines involved will be operated by a new joint-venture majority-owned by the Washington Organisation. Canadian Pacific will have a minority stake in the venture.</p>
<p>Most of the 700 employees working the affected lines will have the opportunity to work for the new company, Canadian Pacific said.</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific operates about 18,000 miles (29,000 km) of rail line in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>The Washington Organisation, headed by Montana industrialist Dennis Washington, has worldwide interests in mining, construction and transportation, including marine operations in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>It owns the Montana Rail Link, which operates 900 miles (1,440 km) of high-density rail line in Montana, Idaho and Washington state.</p>
