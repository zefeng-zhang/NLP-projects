<p>Regional rubber prices in Southeast Asia face another gloomy week because of soft demand and ample stocks in major consumers like Japan, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is soft all around, especially for latex which is hardly moving,&quot; a Malaysian trader told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is not so rosy at the moment. We're still really in the doldrums,&quot; a dealer with a Western rubber trading company in Singapore said.  </p>
<p>An active round of shortcovering over the past two months appears to be at an end, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Usually, demand begins to slow down after every October but this year, it's a bit unusual as buyers began covering much earlier,&quot; a Malaysian dealer said.</p>
<p>Another trader said rains early this month which reduced tapping and supply of raw materials failed to lift prices.</p>
<p>&quot;If the weather begins to improve, prices are going to head south,&quot; another Singapore-based rubber trader said.</p>
<p>Drum latex was being offered by trading houses at Malaysian 233-234 cents a kg last week.  </p>
<p>The Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board quoted the benchmark RSS1 at 310 cents a kg while the SMR20 was at 306.50 cents a kg, both for November buyer, last week.</p>
<p>Thai rubber prices eased last week despite some buying by China, largely due to increased supplies, trade sources said. Traders estimated Chinese buyers could have bought between 10,000-20,000 tonnes of smoked sheet rubber last week for prompt shipment.</p>
<p>&quot;That was not a big order. Besides, Japanese buyers are still sidelined,' one trader said.  </p>
<p>The Thai benchmark RSS3 for November shipment was quoted at around US$1.19-$1.23 a kg FOB Bangkok against the previous week's $1.23-$1.25 a kg.</p>
<p>One trader said the C&amp;F price to China may be around $1.30 a kg and the FOB price to Japan at around $1.21-$1.22 a kg. Thai latex was quoted at U.S. 95 cents a kg in the auction market in Hat Yai, barely changed from 93-95 cents last week.</p>
<p>Traders said the volume of rubber entering the market last week increased, pressuring prices.  </p>
<p>Auction market sources said 371,392 kg of rubber sheets entered the market this week, up about five percent from the previous week. About 294,160 kg of the total were traded, the sources said.</p>
<p>The only exception to the depressed picture is Indonesia, where the benchmark SIR20 rubber price will likely trend steady this week on the back of expected firm demand and attractive prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are likely to trend steady, as demand is seen firm. Any possible rises, however, are likely to be limited due to adequate supply in the market,&quot; one Jakarta-based dealer said.  </p>
<p>U.S. buying of SIR20 January deliveries at U.S. 55.25 cents/lb fob Palembang late on Thursday against the previous 54.75 had sharply boosted sentiment, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said, however, most of the deals were likely to remain for November/December deliveries, with offtakes in small quantity.</p>
<p>Dealers said SIR20 offer prices for November/December deliveries were likely to rise 0.25-0.50 cents/lb to 55.50-56.25 cents/lb fob Medan and to 54.75-55.50 cents fob Palembang, Surabaya and Padang, and at 54.50-55.00 cents fob Jambi and Pontianak.  </p>
<p>Latex prices in the local markets of Bandung and Tangerang were, however, likely to stay weak despite expected lower supply due to poor demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>One Bandung-based latex dealer said October deliveries high amoniac grade latex was last sold at 2,200 rupiah/kg against 2,230 for September deliveries in the local markets.</p>
