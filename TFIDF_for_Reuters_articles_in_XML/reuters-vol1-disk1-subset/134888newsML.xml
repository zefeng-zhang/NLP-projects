<p>Italy's largest banking group San Paolo says it sees the most appropriate level for the lira's entry into Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) as between 1,025 and 1,050 lire per mark.</p>
<p>The group's economics team led by Francesco Giordano listed in a research note four reasons why it is unlikely the current level of the lira should be considered a long-term equilibrium level. The lira is currently trading around 997 lire a mark.</p>
<p>San Paolo point out that Italy's trade balance remains in surplus despite the lira's appreciation from February to October 1996, but says there are time lags and the total effect of the currency appreciation on the trade balance will only be recorded at the year-end and in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Second, the bank points out Italy's tight monetary policy has coincided with lower domestic demand -- a recipe for currency appreciation -- while most economists see a fall in Italian interest rates before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Thirdly, San Paolo said that on previous occasions rises in the Italian debt market have been usually associated with large positive flows of funds from foreign investors, and these flows tend to reverse when the market turns around. Therefore, if the current bond rally reverses, the lira could be weakened.</p>
<p>Fourth, current lira levels have been achieved with the help of the dollar's appreciation against the mark, and there could be a risk to the lira's level if the dollar weakens against the mark.</p>
<p>The Italian government has said it aims to enter the ERM by the end of the year and hopes to begin formal talks on returning the lira to the ERM once its 1997 budget is approved by the lower house of parliament.</p>
