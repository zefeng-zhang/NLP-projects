<headline>N.Korea says hunger strikers' health deteriorating.</headline>

<p>North Korea said on Sunday the health of two South Korean students, on the fifth day of a hunger strike for the release of students detained in Seoul for supporting reunification, is deteriorating.</p>
<p>The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), which has named the students as Ryu Se Hong and To Jong Hwa, said doctors were concerned about how the pair were coping without food.</p>
<p>The students started their fast on Wednesday on the north side of the border town of Panmunjom where they were attending functions supporting reunification of communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea, divided since the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>North and South Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce.</p>
<p>&quot;Medical workers stationed at the Thongil House in Panmunjom today expressed deep concern over the health conditions of Ryu Se Hong and To Jong Hwa...,&quot; KCNA said in a report monitored in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Especially, Ryu Se Hong has become conspicuously lean and weak, a doctor said, expressing doubt about how long he can withstand in future,&quot; KCNA said.</p>
<p>About 3,225 students were arrested in South Korea last week after riot police stormed Seoul's Yonsei University, smashing through burning barricades of desks and chairs and lobbing stun grenades to dislodge mostly female undergraduates.</p>
<p>KCNA has said that prior to starting their hunger strike the two students vowed to risk their lives in protesting South Korea's action in breaking up the rally for reunification and press coverage of the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the two students) noted they would start a hunger strike for an indefinite period, unable to repress their resentment and rancour at the attitude of the authorities and the reptile press,&quot; KCNA said last Wednesday.</p>
<p>North Korea wants reunification of the peninsula under a co-federal system where both countries retain their political and economic systems, while South Korea wants a single government and economic system.</p>
<p>North Korea-watchers in Tokyo have said Pyongyang is likely to milk as much propoganda value as possible from the South's student unrest to divert attention from its own woes caused by disastrous floods which have caused widespread famine.</p>
