<p>Cambodian co-Premier Hun Sen visited Khmer Rouge heartland on Tuesday and assured villagers and dissident guerrillas they can keep their land and weapons when Pailin comes under government control.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can take your land, we will not seize it from you,&quot; the premier told a crowd of 3,000 civilians and breakaway rebels who had gathered at the Rattana Sophoan temple in this war-ravaged town near Cambodia's northwest border with Thailand.</p>
<p>Hun Sen later began unprecedented talks with dissident Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary, who broke with hardliners loyal to Pol Pot in August and has been discussing a merger of Ieng Sary's force of up to 4,000 guerrillas with the government.</p>
<p>The co-premier also pledged not to confiscate the weapons of the guerrillas, whom the government wants to integrate into the army.</p>
<p>Ei Chien, commander of the Pailin-based Division 415, had earlier told Hun Sen and government soldiers, &quot;We will do our best to consolidate the two-month ceasefire so that it will change very quickly into a true permanent peace with no loser and no winner.&quot;</p>
<p>Hun Sen was the prime advocate of granting an amnesty to his bitter foe Ieng Sary from a 1979 death sentence handed down in absentia for his role in the genocide of more than one million people as foreign minister in the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime.</p>
<p>Hun Sen, who was meeting Ieng Sary for the first time, had earlier told the crowd of his plan to build four schools in Pailin and two in the dissidents' Phnom Malai base and to help renovate the temple in Pailin.</p>
<p>&quot;After I build a school in Pailin, I would not give an order to (the military)...sell or destroy this building,&quot; said the premier, who handed out food to the crowd and gave children pens and notebooks sporting a picture of himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Pailin, a gem mining and logging centre that fuelled the Khmer Rouge war treasury for years, was long the official headquarters of the Maoist guerrillas, who reneged on a 1991 U.N.-brokered peace pact and fought the coalition formed in 1993 polls.</p>
<p>&quot;Hun Sen's presence in the city of Pailin today clearly shows that our independent Cambodia is only one and cannot be divided by anybody,&quot; Ei Chien, the Pailin commander and deputy chairman of Ieng Sary's Democratic National Union Movement, told the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;It also clearly shows that nobody can move our people living in the Pailin region to any other camp and that nobody can seize our people's territory, which is their own property.&quot;</p>
<p>Residents of Pailin, which the war had turned into a virtual ghost town until about a month ago, said they were all allotted the same amount of land, but were given private title.</p>
<p>They wanted assurances, given by Hun Sen, that they could keep this land. Analysts said the hardline Khmer Rouge did not allow private ownership and frowned on religion.</p>
<p>Ei Chien also complained that while everyone wanted national reconciliation, &quot;In the past two months we have witnessed many manifestations of the divergence of view and position between us and the military as well as in the civilian field&quot;.</p>
<p>The government, particularly Hun Sen, had shown impatience at the slow pace of reconciliation and was also irritated at the dissidents' demands for top command posts in the military and police and for control of Pailin as a separate province.</p>
<p>But in a positive sign for the future, the royal Cambodian flag, first raised in Pailin on September 17, was still fluttering in the town centre on Tuesday.</p>
