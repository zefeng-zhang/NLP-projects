<title>LITHUANIA: Lithuanian PM-designate set on unpegging currency.</title>
<headline>Lithuanian PM-designate set on unpegging currency.</headline>

<p>Lithuania's prime minister-designate made clear on Wednesday that he wanted to end the fixed exchange rate of the country's litas currency and replace it with an inflation-adjusted system.</p>
<p>Gediminas Vagnorius, named by the Homeland Union which won last week's elections as candidate for prime minister, also said he would hand back to the central bank all its monetary powers.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to avoid a financial crisis, we would like a central bank with classical powers functioning just after the new year,&quot; he told Reuters ahead of meeting a mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>&quot;In future, the litas rate will be adjusted to the inflation rate,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The litas is pegged at four to the dollar under the currency board system, also used in Argentina, Hong Kong and Estonia.</p>
<p>Under the system, the peg is guaranteed by having enough hard currency reserves in the central bank's vaults to match the amount of money in circulation. This requirement would be dropped if the currency board went.</p>
<p>Vagnorius did not openly say that the litas was overvalued but he has done in the past and it has been a consistent theme of the Homeland Union.</p>
<p>The IMF strongly backs the currency board which it says has guaranteed the litas' stability and brought down inflation.</p>
<p>But Vagnorius said he wanted to manage the exchange rate in a conventional manner.</p>
<p>He wanted to allow the central bank to make foreign exchange market interventions, use interest rates and banks' reserve requirements with the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the IMF) agree it can be done, it is just how to do it and how to avoid a panic in the population,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When a banking crisis at the end of last year sparked devaluation fears, there was a big run on the litas and the central bank suffered a large drop in its reserves.</p>
