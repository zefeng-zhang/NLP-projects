<title>RUSSIA: Russian MinFins firm on London investment buying.</title>
<headline>Russian MinFins firm on London investment buying.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds rose on Wednesday on investment interest from London before Russia's Eurobond issue and because Russian debt was more attractive than that of some other countries, dealers said.</p>
<p> tranche		  Sept 4		  Sept 3</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    76.30-76.55	   76.00-76.30</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    48.65-48.90	   48.10-48.40</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    32.15-32.40	   31.60-31.90</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    37.75-38.10	   37.60-37.90</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    27.80-28.10	   27.60-27.90</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have risen today due to London investors' buying. They may be shifting funds out of Bulgarian Bradys whose prices have fallen recently,&quot; a Russian bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was generally looking up before the issue of Eurobonds but added that the lack of issue details was a moderating factor.</p>
<p>&quot;What we see now can be called range-trading... All price moves are related to this (forthcoming Eurobond issue) although a decline, as well as a rally, are possible,&quot; an ICFI Moscow Partners bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the third, fourth and fifth tranches had traded this week in ranges of 75.40-76.50, 47.65-49.00 and 31.00-32.50, respectively.</p>
<p>They said ranges for the sixth and seventh tranches were more difficult to set given their lower liquidity.</p>
