<p>Two successive hikes in overnight rates by the Philippine Central Bank are temporary measures to contain volatility in the foreign exchange market, and interest rates will continue to fall overall, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The central bank raised rates in two successive tranches this week, boosting the overnight lending rate to 14.5 percent from 12.75 percent. It raised the overnight borrowing rate to 12.5 percent from 10.25 percent.</p>
<p>The hike in overnight rates had the desired effect, with the peso strengthening to an average of 26.234 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday from 26.265 on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely, it's a temporary control measure,&quot; Standard Chartered Bank (Philippines) treasurer Steven Gakhar said of the rate increases. He predicted they would fall back soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are generally downwards and this blip might last for a week or two,&quot; said Jim Yap, a trader at Multinational Investment Bancorporation.</p>
<p>The overnight rate increases on Tuesday and Wednesday came at a time when the market was expecting interest rates to fall in line with Treasury bill rates and an expected continuing decline in inflation.</p>
<p>At the latest auction of government securities on Monday, the average yield on the 91-day bill fell to 11.57 percent from 12.029 percent. The previous auction had seen the yield fall to 12.029 percent from 12.074 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the central bank's move to raise rates must have been influenced by the peso's relatively sharp fall on Monday, when it dropped to 26.265 against the dollar.</p>
<p>The peso might have fallen even lower that day, but the central bank intervened, buying $100 million out of $283.7 million traded. Normal daily trading volumes are about $100 million.</p>
<p>Explanations for the fall in the peso ranged from a chain reaction started by a large commercial order for dollars to a supply of extra pesos in the market after investors cut back on buying reverse repos.</p>
<p>The lack of appetite for reverse repos was attributed to a new rule introduced on Monday requiring buyers to allow the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to inspect the deals.</p>
<p>The bank secrecy law gives banks the right not to reveal their transactions and the BIR had complained that it lost taxes on reverse repo deals.</p>
