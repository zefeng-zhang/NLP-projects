<title>UK: SOCCER-SHERINGHAM OUT FOR THREE WEEKS AT INJURY-HIT SPURS.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-SHERINGHAM OUT FOR THREE WEEKS AT INJURY-HIT SPURS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-02</dateline>

<p>England striker Teddy Sheringham will be out for up to three weeks with a thigh strain, adding to premier league Tottenham Hotspur's early-season injury crisis.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old pulled a muscle during an England training session last week, leaving the Londoners short of goalscorers.</p>
<p>Sheringham's striking partner Chris Armstrong is sidelined with a damaged ankle and manager Gerry Francis may be forced to give 18-year-old Rory Allen his first team debut against Wimbledon on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;He's an excellent prospect but still probably a year away from first team level,&quot; Francis admitted on Monday.</p>
<p>Midfielder Darren Anderton, who missed England's 3-0 win in Moldova on Sunday with a groin strain, is doubtful to start, as is reserve England goalkeeper Ian Walker, who damaged his back while warming up with the World Cup squad.</p>
<p>Long-serving captain Gary Mabbutt broke his leg on the opening day of the season and is out for at least four months.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what we've done to deserve this but I am going to be without my two main strikers and, probably, my most gifted midfielder (Anderton) as well,&quot; an exasperated Francis said.</p>
<p>The only good news for Spurs was the arrival of new 1.65-million-pound ($2.58-million) signing Allan Nielsen, who scored for Denmark in their 2-0 World Cup win in Slovenia.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old midfielder flew into London on Monday and will probably make his debut on Wednesday.</p>
