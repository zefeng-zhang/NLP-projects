<p>The privatization of Sao Paulo state's giant power firm Cesp is right on track and the company will take bids over the next few weeks from consultants who will determine its net worth, Cesp President Andrea Matarazzo said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next 20 or 30 days we will start the bidding process for the asset evaluation,&quot; Matarazzo told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Matarazzo took over the top job at Cesp in 1995 with the sole purpose of readying the mammoth state company for privatization.  </p>
<p>Cesp, which generates and delivers 97 percent of the state's electricity, has 25 hydroelectric plants, three of which are still under construction.</p>
<p>Under a plan developed by Matarazzo and state planners, Cesp would sell off its power generating and distribution operations and focus its activities only on wholesale transmission.</p>
<p>Matarazzo said the privatization process is set to begin in May 1997, with the sale of Cesp's 68 percent stake in power distributor CPFL. Hydroelectric plants along the Paranapanema and Pardo rivers are scheduled to be auctioned off later.  </p>
<p>Matarazzo said he was moving as fast as possible to ready the firm's assets for privatization, but he said that ultimately the pace of the selloff would be defined by the Sao Paulo state Privatization Council.</p>
<p>A key goal for Matarazzo is to complete construction of the Canoas I and II and the Porto Primavera hydroelectric plants. Cesp has already found a partner to finish construction of Canoas I and II, Matarazzo said.</p>
<p>He added that Cesp was studying partnerships with private companies to complete construction of Porto Primavera, which will cost an additional $1.3 billion.  </p>
<p>The financing plan for Porto Primavera will be ready within a month and the plant is expected to start operating in 1998, he said.</p>
<p>To make Cesp more attractive to bidders, the company has slashed its payroll to 11,000 from 20,000 last year, Matarazzo said. At the same time, a successful restructuring plan has allowed the firm to boost power generation to 9,900 megawatts from 9,450 megawatts, he added.</p>
<p>Although the restructuring has improved operational results, a huge debt of $11.4 billion is still harming the firm's earnings, he said.</p>
<p>Matarazzo said he hoped the firm's debt load would fall with proceeds from the sale of CPFL and some hydroelectric plants. He added that Cesp has been lengthening the maturity of its $6.5 billion commercial bank  debt.</p>
<p>Cesp has already lengthened the maturity period of $1.2 billion by issuing debt abroad and debentures in the domestic market.</p>
<p>The firm is also mulling the idea of a global issue of nearly $300 million in Eurobonds denominated in Portuguese, Japanese or British currencies, he added.</p>
<p>Cesp has also begun negotiations with Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) to securitize future privatization revenues of up to $3 billion, Matarazzo said.</p>
