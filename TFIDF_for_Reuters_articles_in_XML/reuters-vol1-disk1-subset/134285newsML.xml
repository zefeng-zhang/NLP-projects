<p>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. said Tuesday that it plans to divest four non-core businesses within six months in order to focus on its packaging and speciality chemicals businesses.</p>
<p>The company said the sales of the four units, which previously had been classified as discontinued operations, are expected to generate about $300 million in pre-tax proceeds.</p>
<p>Grace said the businesses -- Grace TEC Systems, Grace Speciality Polymers, Grace Cocoa and Amicon -- do not fit in with its strategy of becoming a dominant packaging and speciality chemicals company.</p>
<p>Grace TEC supplies dryers for the paper industry and Grace Speciality Polymers supplies materials used in making circuit boards and components.</p>
<p>Grace Cocoa produces and sells cocoa and chocolate while Amicon supplies biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with molecular separation and purification products.</p>
<p>&quot;We already have received interest from numerous parties for each of these businesses and, through the divestitures, we expect to generate greater value for Grace shareholders,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Grace's stock was up 37.50 cents at $54.625 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
