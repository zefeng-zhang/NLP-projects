<p>Turkey will appeal to the United Nations and its Western allies to reverse a U.N. decision to delay a $2 billion oil-for-food plan for Iraq after fighting in the country's Kurdish north, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will hold appeals to the United Nations and to our allies to stop this,&quot; said a senior government official, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot pay the price of the developments in northern Iraq,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali said on Sunday that he would delay implementing the oil-for-food plan for Iraq on concerns of safety of U.N. oil monitors because of the deteriorating situation in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>According to U.S. officials, Iraq massed up to 40,000 troops over the weekend in northern Iraq and captured the city of Arbil, expelling one Kurdish faction and installing a rival group more favourable to Baghdad.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Turkish Energy Minister Recai Kutan said he expected a delay &quot;for some time&quot; in the flow of Iraqi oil through a trans-Turkish pipeline.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the oil flow will be delayed for some time. But we will make efforts that it is flowed by Sept. 15, as we expected earlier,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in liaison with the foreign ministry but the picture in the northern Iraq is not clear yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government official said Turkey was opposed &quot;to an indefinite delay of the plan. We are aware that things are not in our control but we will do our best to have the implementation of the (Iraqi oil) sales realised without delay,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials said Turkey had lost some $25 billion in overall trade with Iraq since the U.N. sanctions were put in place after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq was Turkey's top oil supplier and third-largest trade partner before the Gulf crisis.</p>
<p>Turkish food and medicine companies have sent several missions to Iraq since June to win the lion's share of Iraq's food and medicine purchases, worth about $1.3 billion under the U.N. deal.</p>
<p>The United Nations decided last week to delay a formal Turkish request that Ankara be given permission under the U.N. Charter 50 to help it recoup trade losses in a similar manner to Iraq's neighbour, Jordan.</p>
<p>The government official did not say when Turkey would take its appeal to the United Nations and its allies -- the United States, Britain and France -- in the Security Council.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said Sunday before Ghali's decision that the United Nations should not change the timing of the oil-for-food plan.</p>
<p>The U.N. oil-for-food plan, agreed on May 20, allows Iraq to sell oil worth $2 billion over six months to buy food and medicine for its people, suffering under sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>Iraq would sell more than half of its oil through the 986-km (616-mile) Turkish pipeline, shut down in 1990 as part of the U.N. embargo on Iraq.</p>
<p>Turkey has repeatedly said the oil would flow through the pipeline by Sept. 15.</p>
