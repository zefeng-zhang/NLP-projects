<p>The U.S. Defence Department on Wednesday night denied a report on Iraqi state television that U.S. missiles has been fired at military bases and civilian areas in the capital Baghdad, killing a number of people.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no attack,&quot; said Air Force Col. Doug Kennett, a Pentagon spokesman. He repeated earlier denials  by President Bill Clinton and other Pentagon officials that any attack had been launched on Baghdad.  </p>
<p>Iraq said U.S. missiles hit military bases and civilian areas in the capital on Wednesday evening, killing a number of people.</p>
<p>&quot;At 8.45 p.m. the American enemy directed its failing missiles against our military bases and civilian places and a number of them have fallen in Baghdad,&quot; Iraqi state television reported, quoting a statement by the general command of the Iraqi armed forces.</p>
<p>Residents in Baghdad heard several large explosions, as well as anti-aircraft fire, but did not know what had caused them. Air-raid sirens sounded.</p>
<p>State television showed pictures of a building which it said was destroyed in the attack and a crater in a road in a residential area. Government officials said they would take reporters in Baghdad to see the damage.</p>
