<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS - SFE wheat turns active on profit-taking.</title>
<headline>RTRS - SFE wheat turns active on profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wheat futures fell moderately in active trading on profit-taking on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brokers, buoyed by the more active market, said there was good buying support at lower levels across the board.</p>
<p>Market leader January 1997, which opened at A$149.50 and closed at A$152.50 on settlement prices, found very strong support at A$150.00, said Phil Lindsay of Ord Minnett Jardine Fleming Futures Ltd.</p>
<p>January 1997, March 1997, May and July all traded between 50 cents and A$3.00 lower, with 55 contracts changing hands.  </p>
<p>Lindsay said a more active market was a healthy sign and profit-taking had the potential to produce a technical rally.</p>
<p>Chartists were predicting Chicago would bottom tonight.</p>
<p>&quot;We may be near the lows for ASW (Australian Standard White) based on that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rumours that Russia was looking for two million tonnes of feed wheat, from either Canada or Australia, was also supportive for the ASW contract, he said.</p>
<p>But the increased estimate by ABARE for a 1996/97 Australian crop of 20.9 million tonnes was a negative, as ABARE approached Ord Minnett's estimate of slightly above 22 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>End users also remained out of the futures market, with flour mills and feed mills buying hand-to-mouth, he said.</p>
<p>The Australian Wheat Board's A$5.00 pool price cut had no impact on futures, which led the pool price cut, he said.  </p>
