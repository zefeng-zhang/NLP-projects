<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian king supports mass amnesty plan.</title>
<headline>Cambodian king supports mass amnesty plan.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1996-08-24</dateline>

<p>King Norodom Sihanouk said he supported a proposed mass amnesty, a royal palace official said on Sunday, fuelling speculation that the notorious leader of a breakaway faction of the Khmer Rouge would be pardoned.</p>
<p>An official at the royal palace said on Sunday that the king fully supported a suggestion to declare a mass pardon on his 74th birthday on October 31.</p>
<p>&quot;I have received a letter of request to grant amnesty on the occasion of my birthday,&quot; the palace official said, quoting a letter from the king to Cambodia's most senior Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to express my support 100 percent for this request,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>Sihanouk did not say who might be included in the amnesty but there have been suggestions from government leaders that Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge number two, be forgiven for his part in atrocities committed during the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge reign of terror.</p>
<p>More than a million Cambodians died of starvation, disease or overwork on mass labour camps, or were executed as enemies of the Maoist-style revolution.</p>
<p>Ieng Sary, sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the killings, now heads a dissident Khmer Rouge faction which earlier this month rejected what it called the hardline rulers under paramount chief Pol Pot and vowed to make peace with the government.</p>
<p>The surprise split in the guerrilla group has led to hopes that more rebel units might opt for peace and Cambodia's long guerrilla war might draw to a close.</p>
<p>But the peace talks with the Khmer Rouge dissidents have also given rise to a questions as to the fate of top Khmer Rouge leaders held responsible for the &quot;killing files&quot; atrocities, among them Ieng Sary.</p>
<p>Co-premier Hun Sen announced soon after the split in the Khmer Rouge became known that Ieng Sary would be protected.</p>
<p>First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh later said that it was up to parliament to decide if Khmer Rouge leaders should be pardoned and last week Ranariddh said the government would ask the national assembly to scrap a 1994 law banning the guerrilla group.</p>
<p>Sihanouk, Ranariddh and Hun Sen once worked with the Khmer Rouge and the king is said to have developed an intense dislike for Ieng Sary.</p>
<p>A Cambodian government team travelled to a remote corner of the country on Sunday to discuss in detail the demands of the breakaway faction negotiating for peace.</p>
<p>The government team, led by armed forces deputy chief of staff, General Nhek Bun Chhay, returned to the northwestern town of Poipet on the Thai border late on Sunday from several hours of talks in Phnom Malai, one of two key rebel base areas controlled by the dissidents.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an informal meeting,&quot; team member Long Sarin, a senior official based at the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok, told Reuters in Poipet.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't reached an agreement but the meeting went well. We understood each other,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Long Sarin declined to go into details of the talks but said Ieng Sary's son, Ieng Savuth, represented his father. More talks would be held soon, he said.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge dominated a guerrilla alliance which included royalist forces which battled a Vietnamsese army of occupation, and the Hanoi-backed government in Phnom Penh during the 1980s.</p>
<p>All sides in the Cambodian war signed an international peace treaty in 1991 but the Khmer Rouge later pulled out of the peace process and rejected United Nations-run elections in 1993.</p>
