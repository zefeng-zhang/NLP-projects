<p>Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Horizon Air unit Wednesday ordered 25 new Bombardier Inc. Dash 8-200 turboprop airplanes in a deal valued at more than $270 million, officials said.</p>
<p>Alaska has placed conditional orders for 15 additional planes and has taken options on 30 more, raising the value of the deal to more than $700 million if all options are exercised and orders completed.</p>
<p>Delivery of the 25 airplanes will begin in the first quarter of next year and be completed by the second quarter of 1998, said Horizon spokeswoman Nancy Pappas.</p>
<p>Pappas said the 37-seat Bombardier aircraft would replace the smaller 18-seat Fairchild Metroliner and 31-seat Dornier models in Horizon's fleet so all its propeller-driven planes will be Dash 8 models, including the older Dash 8-100.</p>
<p>&quot;That will significantly reduce the cost of training, inventory and operations,&quot; Pappas said.</p>
<p>The airline currently has a fleet of 63 aircraft, including 13 Fokker NV F-28 jets which seat up to 69 people.</p>
<p>Colin Fisher, a spokesman for Bombardier's regional aircraft division in Toronto, said he did not know what conditions had been placed on the 15-plane segment of the order but said it was &quot;closer to a firm order than an option.&quot;</p>
<p>Bombardier also said Horizon could convert its orders to buy the larger Dash 8-300 at relatively short notice. The Dash 8-300 airplanes seat 50 and sell for about $13 million, compared with slightly more than $10 million for the series 200 models.</p>
<p>The planes are powered by engines made by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada unit.</p>
<p>Horizon serves 40 cities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, California, western Canada and Alaska.</p>
<p>Alaska Air's stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $21.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
