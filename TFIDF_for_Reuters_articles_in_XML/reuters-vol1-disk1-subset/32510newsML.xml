<p>Nearly 70 people have been injured in Bangladesh in clashes between supporters of rival candidates during the run up to Thursday's parliamentary by-elections, police said.</p>
<p>They said at least 50 people were hurt on Tuesday in battles between supporters of competing candidates in Chandanaish in southern Chittagong district. About 20 others were injured elsewhere, police told reporters.</p>
<p>The Election Commission said on Thursday that troops would be deployed during the vote in the 15 constituencies being contested, all outside the capital of Dhaka. The elections are being monitored by local and foreign observers.</p>
<p>Bangladesh held general elections on June 12 and the ruling Awami League won 146 of the parliament's 300 elected seats.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia won 116 seats, followed by the Jatiya Party of former president Hossain Mohammad Ershad with 32.</p>
<p>Bangladesh law allows candidates to run in more than one constituency, but they can retain only one. The commission later ordered by-elections in 16 districts vacated by victors who opted to retain other parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>Election officials said 73 candidates from the Awami League, BNP and Jatiya Party were contesting the 15 constituencies. The election in the 16th constituency has been delayed.</p>
