<title>JAPAN: Japanese second-tier brokers see profits in 96/97.</title>
<headline>Japanese second-tier brokers see profits in 96/97.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Almost all Japanese second-tier brokers said on Tuesday that their business would return to profit in the current 1996/97 fiscal year to the end of March.</p>
<p>Nine out of the 10 firms said they would post parent current profits ranging from one billion yen to 10 billion in 1996/97. Only Yamatane Securities Co Ltd said it expected to post a parent current loss of 1.2 billion yen in 1996/97.</p>
<p>In 1995/96, Kokusai Securities Co Ltd, and Wako Securities Co Ltd were the only second-tier brokers to post parent current profits.  </p>
<p>Executives at the second-tier brokers said their business forecasts for 1996/97 were based on daily turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) averaging 400 billion yen to 420 billion yen.</p>
<p>The forecasts were unveiled when the 10 second-tier brokers announced their actual business results for the first half of 1996/97 to September 30.</p>
<p>In the first half, three of the 10 -- Kokusai Securities, Sanyo Securities Co Ltd and Okasan Securities Co Ltd -- posted parent current profits.  </p>
<p>While seven out of the 10 firms posted parent current losses ranging from 228 million yen to 2.97 billion yen in the first half of 1996/97, that was an improvement from a year earlier, due to rising daily turnover in the Tokyo markets.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1995/96, all the firms except for Kokusai posted parent current losses ranging from 1.44 billion yen to 13.85 billion.</p>
<p>Despite the brighter business outlook, analysts said most of the firms would remain under pressure in the second half.  </p>
<p>The second-tier brokers need to further restructure to cut costs and diversify their profit sources because their mainstay customers, individual investors, have been reluctant to actively invest in the stock market, analysts said.</p>
<p>Amid growing pressure to liberalise stockbroking fees, second-tier brokers must try harder to streamline their businesses, they also said.</p>
<p>The rest of the 10 second-tier brokers are New Japan Securities Co Ltd, Kankaku Securities Co Ltd, Tokyo Securities Co Ltd, Cosmo Securities Co Ltd, and Dai-Ichi Securities Co Ltd.</p>
