<p>Netcom On-Line Communications Services Chief Financial Officer Thom Weatherford said Wall Street forecasts of improving gross margins starting in the fourth quarter were &quot;reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said Tuesday the Internet service provider expected its average revenue per user (ARPU) to stabilize in its fourth quarter after recent declines slowed in the September period.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it's going to stabilize in the fourth quarter,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview after the company said its third-quarter loss widened to $13.6 million, or $1.17 a share, from a loss of $4.4 million, or $0.49, in year-earlier period.  </p>
<p>The loss was slightly narrower than analysts had projected. The consensus estimate was for a loss of $1.24, according to the First Call survey of analysts.</p>
<p>Weatherford declined to issue specific financial forecasts for coming quarters.</p>
<p>Still, &quot;Wall Street has us showing improvement quarter over quarter&quot; after the third quarter,&quot; he noted. &quot;I think at this point it seems like a reasonable forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>Netcom's worldwide gross margins were 24.1 percent for the third quarter, down from 26.7 percent in the second quarter.  </p>
<p>Start-up operations in Britain and Canada have contributed to pressure on gross margins, while analysts expect any bottoming-out of the average revenue per customer could help offset that in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Weatherford said average revenue per customer was $20.50 in the third quarter, a decrease of about five percent from the second quarter but a slowing from the seven percent drop it experienced between the first and second quarters.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to first stabilize it, and we think there's a lot of opportunity out there, with the correct product and service, to grow that,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Netcom's third-quarter revenue more than doubled from the previous year, and rose 14 percent sequentially, to a record $32 million. Net subscribers were up 83,000, or 17 percent from the second quarter, to 562,000.</p>
<p>Weatherford said Netcom had confidence in its business model -- with some revision over time -- despite the entry early this year of competitors such as AT&amp;T. He said the company expected to maintain its pricing structure.</p>
<p>&quot;What our price tests have shown us is the $19.95 model still works very well. In fact it's a great value to our customer base,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Netcom expects to start adding more services late in the fourth quarter or early next year. Weatherford said the additions were designed to increase the amount customers spend and also the services they can access using Netcom.</p>
<p>&quot;We think there's a great opportunity to 'up-sell' this customer base, and that's what we're going to concentrate on,&quot; he said. &quot;The $9.95 for 10 hours still doesn't make a lot of sense to us. You still have to spend the same amount of time and money to acquire those customers and to service them.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the company had not changed its longer-term objectives for growth and eventual profitability.  </p>
<p>&quot;What Wall Street has said -- and we feel comfortable with it -- is positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) in the first quarter of 1997 domestically, and probably profitability in the U.S. something like four quarters afterward,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those quarters still look good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said worldwide profitability would overseas expansion and and how the company proceeds with those investments.</p>
<p>&quot;Positive cash is our first priority, and we think that will be some time in 1998 on a consolidated basis,&quot; he said.</p>
