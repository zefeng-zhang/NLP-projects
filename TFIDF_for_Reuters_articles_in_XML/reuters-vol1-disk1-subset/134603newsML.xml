<p>Japanese shares in London were little changed but with a slightly easier bias on Tuesday after profit-taking hit some leading stocks.</p>
<p>London's Nikkei/Ise 50 index was up just 0.01 points at 1,438.38 by 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the election, foreign investors have been lightening their exposure to Japan,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Some of the household names that have led the market up recently are now leading the market back down.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Fujitsu was one of the stocks hit by profit-taking.  </p>
<p>The shares were trading at 1,024 yen in London after a Tokyo close of 1,030.</p>
<p>Shares in Honda Motor were down 10 yen from the close in Japan, trading at 2,690 yen by 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, traders said news that Nichiei Finance had applied for liquidation had hit sentiment surrounding bank and finance stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the banks are looking shaky after the news highlighted the fact that they still have large amounts of bad loans on their books,&quot; one said.  </p>
<p>Sakura Bank slipped to 1,085 yen in London, from 1,100 in Tokyo and Fuji Bank was trading at 2,102.5 yen after finishing at 2,110 in Japan.</p>
<p>But dealers said Tokyo stocks, which have been feeble since the election could soon bottom out.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect another weak day in Tokyo but as we approach 21,000 the market is slowing down on the downside, so we could see some fairly good support around this level,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 closed at 21,123.68 on Tuesday having lost 179.27 points, or 0.84 percent.</p>
