<p>Japanese business leaders gave a cautious welcome to the conservative Liberal Democratic Party's robust showing in Sunday's election and urged the new government to enact reforms to ensure future economic success.</p>
<p>But worries over the fate of Japan's economic recovery and meaningful reform, given the prospect of a coalition government and the LDP's image as keepers of the status quo, helped slash share prices and boost government bond futures on Monday.</p>
<p>The general election -- the first since the LDP lost its monopoly on power in 1993 -- put the party in the driver's seat but without the clear majority many pollsters thought possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Our nation now confronts a crucial moment on the eve of the 21st century,&quot; said Jiro Nemoto, chairman of Nikkeiren, the employers' federation. &quot;We want the new administration to...exert leadership in resolutely enacting the structural reforms we have been seeking.&quot;</p>
<p>The main business lobby, Keidanren, echoed that sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the new administration...will be stable and take strong initiatives,&quot; said Keidanren Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda.</p>
<p>The LDP fell 12 seats short of the 251 it needed to govern alone and was expected to ask its two minority partners in the outgoing government, the tiny Sakigake party and the Social Democrats, to stay in the ruling camp.</p>
<p>It was also expected to court the new Democratic Party -- a recently formed group of reformist lawmakers -- and draw on defectors from the opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).</p>
<p>Some optimists had hoped an LDP majority would help Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is expected to head the next government, end policy drift and enact the deregulation big business wants and economists say is vital to ensure Japan's corporations succeed in global competition.</p>
<p>There were lingering hopes that some efforts would be made.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now the coalition cabinet has emphasised consensus so it lacked leadership,&quot; said Toshiaki Kakimoto, managing director of the Japan Research Institute. &quot;This time the LDP has increased its votes, so we hope they can take responsibility and have the power to implement (policies).&quot;</p>
<p>That, however, hardly implies drastic moves on matters like deregulation, tax reform and provisions for a rapidly ageing population that will burden public coffers, sceptics said.</p>
<p>Bond traders were gloomy.</p>
<p>&quot;The LDP is seeking to maintain a partnership with the Social Democrats and Sakigake...suggesting interest rates will stay capped, as such a coalition would only accentuate the slow pace of the recovery,&quot; said Shoji Kitta, managing director at money broker Tokyo Tanshi Co.</p>
<p>The key 225-share Nikkei average, meanwhile, fell more than 300 points to 21,302.95 on worries that the LDP might not be able to keep campaign pledges to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Shorter term, the need for the LDP to scramble for coalition partners clouds the outlook for some concrete steps business and share market players are keen to see implemented.</p>
<p>Among those are corporate tax cuts, reform of the anti-monopoly law to allow holding companies, and revisions of real estate rules to promote property market liquidity.</p>
<p>An LDP-led coalition will likely go ahead with a planned rise in the three-percent sales tax to five percent from next April, but it remained unclear whether Japan would introduce a stimulative supplementary budget for the current fiscal year to March 1997 to prop up the economy's tentative recovery.</p>
<p>The economy is gradually emerging from a prolonged slump which followed the bursting of a late-1980s economic &quot;bubble&quot;, but the recovery is patchy and has owed much to government stimulus spending and record-low interest rates.</p>
