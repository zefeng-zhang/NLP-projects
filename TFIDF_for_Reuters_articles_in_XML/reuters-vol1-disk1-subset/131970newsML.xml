<p>Japanese stocks slid sharply while government bonds surged to a record high on Monday after Sunday's general election, which left the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) without a clear majority.</p>
<p>The dollar, on the other hand, was largely unimpressed.</p>
<p>Currency dealers said the election results, which mean current Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is likely to remain in charge of a coalition government forged through an alliance with smaller parties, were basically as expected.</p>
<p>But stocks closed sharply lower despite this, with rounds of selling sparked by disappointment over the lack of an LDP majority in the key Lower House eating away at gains posted in last week's trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The profit-taking was accelerated by disappointment that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) did not win a majority,&quot; said Akihiro Naemura, strategist at Okasan Securities.</p>
<p>Many in the markets are concerned that yet another unwieldy coalition government could lead to friction over policies and impede Japan's already sluggish economic recovery.</p>
<p>The stock market's benchmark Nikkei 225 average sank 309.35 points, or 1.43 percent, to settle at 21,302.95. Trade was muted as many investors decided to adopt a wait-and-see stance, brokers said.</p>
<p>Despite various media polls which said the LDP could be headed for a simple majority of at least 251 seats in the Lower House of parliament, the party was only able to grab 239.</p>
<p>&quot;Eyes are now on what sort of coalition government will be formed and what sort of policies will be carried out,&quot; Naemura said. &quot;Until the new government starts functioning, with economic stimulus policies strong enough to lure investors off the sidelines, the market is likely to be very quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign exchange dealers agreed that the makeup of the coalition government was likely to make the most difference in the long run, although they added that even this was not expected to affect currencies significantly.</p>
<p>Although the dollar rose briefly to a high of 112.89 yen in Tokyo afternoon trade, its strongest since January 1994, dealers said this was due more to aggressive buying of various currencies against the yen than the election itself.</p>
<p>The greenback was at 112.70 yen in late afternoon Tokyo, compared with 112.55 yen at New York's Friday close.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the key December Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract responded to the poor showing of the Shinshinto, or New Frontier Party, by surging to 123.70 yen, an all-time high for any benchmark, before ending with hefty gains.</p>
<p>Shinshinto, the main opposition party, had opposed a consumption tax rise and favoured income tax cuts, and a win risked a boost in spending and upward pressure on interest rates. The market was also relieved by the stronger LDP showing.</p>
<p>Shoji Kitta, managing director of Japan's largest money broker Tokyo Tanshi, said: &quot;The LDP is seeking to maintain a partnership with the Social Democrats and Sakigake in a new coalition, which suggests rates will stay capped, as such a coalition would only accentuate the slow pace of recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>The LDP's partners in the current coalition are opposed to raising liquidity in land transactions, the lack of which is at the core of the nation's problem of bad loans. Unless this is raised, economic recovery will remain slow and interest rates low, Kitta added.</p>
