<p>Blue-chip stocks edged higher Wednesday as International Business Machines Corp. shares surged, while bonds slid after a disappointing monthly Treasury auction of fresh five-year notes.</p>
<p>The dollar rallied against the yen on news of surprising weakness in Japan's economy, but it slipped against the German mark as the outlook for a proposed single European currency continued to worsen.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 1.11 points at 5,712.38. In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 1,297 to 978 on light volume of 296 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rally in IBM shored up sentiment in the market, which was typically slow ahead of the Labour Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>IBM gained after Salomon Brothers said the shares of the world's biggest computer maker could reach a 12-month target of $145.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is when we have a thin market like the one we have, people are likely to crowd around the one or two ideas catching the Street's attention,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>John Jones, an analyst at Salomon, said he upgraded IBM to a strong buy from buy, citing rising near-term confidence in the computer maker's fundamentals.</p>
<p>IBM, one of the 30-stock Dow Jones components, rose 2-7/8 to 114-5/8, giving a nearly nine-point lift to the index.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market had entered a seasonally strong period in the three days preceding Monday's Labour Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, approaching Labour Day historically we've had rising prices since 1896 about 80 percent of the time,&quot; said Harry Laubscher, an analyst at Tucker Anthony.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury edged down 3/32, or 93.75 cents on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 6.98 percent to 6.97 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 108.45 yen in late trading from 107.70 late Tuesday, but it fell to 1.4767 marks from 1.4785.</p>
<p>Grain and cotton prices fell sharply as professional speculators took profits and exited the market before the Labour Day holiday.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, November soybeans closed at $7.88-3/4, down 7 cents a bushel, after hitting a high during the day at $8.02.</p>
<p>December corn closed 6 cents lower at $3.42-3/4 a bushel and December wheat ended 9 cents lower at $4.55.</p>
<p>At the New York Cotton Exchange, December cotton closed 0.65 cent a pound lower at $76.11 after rising earlier this week on worries that Hurricane Edouard could damage the maturing Southeast cotton crop.</p>
<p>But the storm Wednesday was forecast to turn northwest in the Atlantic and largely miss the United States.</p>
<p>Reduced concern over possible damage from Hurricane Edouard also prompted a fall in lumber futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. September lumber, which hit a 2-1/2 year high Tuesday, closed 70 cents lower at $413.20 per thousand board feet.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index closed 13.0 points higher at 3,918.7. In Tokyo, the key Nikkei 225 average ended down 200.46 points, or 0.96 percent, at 20,709.81.</p>
