<p>Nickel hopeful Anaconda Nickel NL said on Monday it was conducting final negotiations with potential joint venture partners for its Murrin Murrin nickel project in Western Australia, which included negotiations with major shareholder, Swiss commodities dealer, Glencore AG.</p>
<p>Anaconda said in its annual report that it expected to be in a position to select a joint venture partner in the current quarter. &quot;Preparation of draft agreements has commenced with potential joint venturers which are two major mining companies and Swiss-based commodities trader Glencore AG,&quot; Anaconda said.  </p>
<p>The report also said an Asian industrial conglomerate had pursued detailed negotiations with Anaconda with a view to purchasing a 30 percent direct interest in the project and provide distribution facilities to the Asian markets.</p>
<p>Anaconda said that immediately following a binding agreement with a joint venturer it would move to direct discussions with a major project finance banks and rating agencies to provide for its main debt finance.  </p>
<p>&quot;Anaconda's advisers have indicated that a significant appetite exists for a project financing of Murrin Murrin's quality, and they expect to be able to move to provision of financing within three/four months of the finalisation of equity arrangements,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The company said one of the &quot;world's largest banks&quot; had also approached Anaconda with an offer to provide US$500 million in a project-linked finance facility.</p>
<p>Glencore has a 14.53 percent stake in Anaconda having reduced its interest in the company from 17.14 percent earlier this month to meet foreign ownership regulations.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Anaconda's chief executive, Andrew Forest, is due to make a presentation about the company's operations at a nickel conference being held in the Western Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie this week.</p>
<p>At 3.50 p.m. (0550 GMT), Anaconda shares were 40 cents higher at A$3.74 after earlier touching a record high of A$3.85.</p>
