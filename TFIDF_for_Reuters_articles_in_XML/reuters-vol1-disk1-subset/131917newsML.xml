<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday began what were expected to be protracted negotiations to secure a majority after voters denied his Liberal Democratic Party a clear mandate in general elections.</p>
<p>The LDP secured 239 seats in Sunday's voting, 12 short of the 251 it needed to govern alone in the 500-seat Lower House.</p>
<p>The result pointed to a second term for Hashimoto, but only after days if not weeks of the sort of political turmoil that has plagued Japan since the election in 1993 which put the LDP out of office for the first time in 38 years, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The political situation will remain unstable and weak government will continue,&quot; said political commentator Minoru Morita. &quot;The main point in Japanese politics now is how soon or how late the next elections will be held.&quot; Hashimoto, the LDP president, was to meet on Monday evening with the heads of Sakigake and the Social Democrats, his minority partners in the outgoing government which both emerged from Sunday's polls at a fraction of their former strength.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot run parliament smoothly alone and we have first called on our allies, Sakigake and the Social Democrats,&quot; said LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato.</p>
<p>Sakigake, with only two seats in the lower chamber, has shown it is keen to stay in the ruling camp. But the Social Democrats, with 15 in the Lower House and a critical 32 in the Upper House where the LDP is weak, remains noncommittal.</p>
<p>While the LDP publicly courted the two minority parties, its lawmakers worked behind the scenes to lure defectors from the main opposition party, Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), whose unity appeared in doubt after a disappointing poor election showing.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the number of Shinshinto members that will cross over is in the double digits,&quot; senior LDP official Shizuka Kamei said in a televised interview.</p>
<p>Shinshinto secured 156 seats, four fewer than before.</p>
<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun daily newspaper reported that ten members of Shinshinto would meet in Tokyo on Monday to formalise their plan to quit the party and work with the LDP.</p>
<p>The rebels-in-waiting were led by Hiroshi Kumagai, a former trade minister and staunch critic of Shinshinto head Ichiro Ozawa. Ozawa is under pressure to stand down after the disappointing poll showing.</p>
<p>Analysts said the LDP could woo minority groups with limited clout of their own to avoid having to make policy compromises with the Democratic Party, a 52-seat group that demands drastic reform pledges before joining a coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;If he can pull together independents, Shinshinto rebels, and small groups, none of those would have enough strength to pull down the government,&quot; said John Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute.</p>
<p>As Tokyo's political district of Nagatacho returned to horse trading as usual, Japanese newspapers urged the LDP to accept its limited mandate humbly and blamed all major parties for a record-low turnout of just over 59 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The LDP should not get too full of itself,&quot; the liberal daily Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial comment. &quot;Not only did it fail to win a majority under an electoral system that favoured the ruling party, it was overall political stability -- rather than specific policies -- that the voters chose.&quot;</p>
<p>The messy outcome leaves many unanswered questions about economic policies as Japan, emerging from a lengthy slump, struggles to clear a path to future growth.</p>
