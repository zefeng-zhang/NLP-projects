<headline>Most Americans back Clinton on Iraq attack - poll.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Americans overwhelmingly approve of President Bill Clinton's missile attack on Iraq, an ABC News poll shows.</p>
<p>However, the poll, released late on Tuesday, indicated most Americans do not think the attack will stop Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from further violating terms of the Gulf War ceasefire.</p>
<p>Seventy-nine percent of Americans said they approved of the U.S. attack on Iraq early on Tuesday, and 16 percent disapproved.</p>
<p>Five percent had no opinion. The poll was completed before Tuesday night's second wave of U.S. military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>Fifty-four percent of Americans polled said the United States' overall policy on Iraq was about right, but 39 percent said it was too weak.</p>
<p>However, 74 percent said the missile attack would not keep Iraq from violating the terms of the Gulf War ceasefire. Twenty-one percent said it would.</p>
<p>Fifty-two percent said the United States was headed for a another war with Iraq, against 44 percent who said it was not.</p>
<p>The poll involved 515 adults interviewed by telephone on Tuesday. The margin of error is 5 percent.</p>
