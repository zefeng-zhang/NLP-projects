<text>
<p>American Express Co said Walter Berman, the chief financial officer of its Travel Related Services unit and treasurer of American Express Co has resigned.  </p>
<p>In a letter to American Express employees, American Express Chairman and Chief Executive Harvey Golub, said Berman was leaving the company to form his own consulting practice.</p>
<p>The practice will advise senior leaders of major companies on corporate finance, acquisitions, re-engineering and &quot;maximizing shareholder value.&quot;</p>
<p>Golub said the company will begin a process to select a successor to Berman when Richard Goeltz, the new chief financial officer and vice chairman of American Express arrives in early September.</p>
<p>He said that candidates both from within and outside the company would be considered as replacements.</p>
<p>In the interim, the Travel Related Services business unit chief financial officers will report both to Goeltz and to the heads of their respective business units.</p>
<p>All of Berman's other direct reports will be managed by Goeltz during the transition period, Golub said.</p>
<p>Berman had held a succession of increasingly senior positions wit American Express since he joined the company in 1965, with the exception of a break between 1969 to 1973 when he worked for American Airlines.</p>
