<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole is holding on to gains against President Bill Clinton since the Republican convention and was just five percentage points behind among likely voters, according to an ABC news survey released on Sunday.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,206 likely voters conducted from Thursday through Saturday showed Clinton with 47 percent, Dole 42 percent and Texas billionaire Ross Perot with 7 percent.</p>
<p>The gap between Clinton and Dole was wider, at nine percentage points, if the survey was of &quot;registered&quot; rather than &quot;likely&quot; voters. Clinton had 47 percent of registered voters, Dole 38 percent and Perot 9 percent. The sample size was larger for registered voters was larger at 1,513.</p>
<p>Likely voters are those who say they are certain to vote.</p>
<p>ABC said the survey of likely voters may be more indicative of how the race would turn out because Republicans are more likely to vote on election day.</p>
<p>&quot;Election day exit polls almost always show the Republican share of the final vote to be higher than the distribution of Republicans in the general public,&quot; ABC said.</p>
<p>ABC cautioned that history suggests Clinton will get some sort of &quot;bounce&quot; in the polls from the Democratic national convention in Chicago this week, when the spotlight will be on him. &quot;But as the delegates gathered this weekend, no Clinton bounce has been spotted yet,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by Chilton Research Services, had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
