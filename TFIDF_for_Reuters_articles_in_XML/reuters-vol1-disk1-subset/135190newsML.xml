<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spot up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spot up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed down on Tuesday with state banks increasing their lending due to higher interest rates on the repo market than on the interbank market, traders said.</p>
<p>The day's falls were also partly a technical correction after the contracts had risen for five trading days, they said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active seven-day contract fell to 12.00 percent from 20.00 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Turnover fell to 8.45 million lots from 11.9 million lots. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders believe the rates are likely to regain ground in the short term due to continued new domestic A shares.  </p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up on Tuesday on a technical rebound but sentiment continued to be weak after weeks of falls, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 rose to 122.60 yuan from 122.08 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market rose to 1.52 million lots from 1.11 million.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the spot prices to fall in the short term with the active A share markets attracting much liquidity from the T-bill spot market.</p>
