<title>USA: NYMEX gasoline ends higher on Venezuela outage.</title>
<headline>NYMEX gasoline ends higher on Venezuela outage.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX gasoline prices ended higher Tuesday on news Petroleos de Venezuela's Amuay refinery suffered a partial outage, while heating oil prices declined on prospects of increasing supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The refinery supplies about 70,000 barrels per day of gasoline, so the effect of this problem (on supply) could be significant depending on how long this lasts,&quot; said a New York trader.</p>
<p>November gasoline settled up 1.20 cents at 69.12 cents a gallon while November heating oil ended off 0.18 cent at 73.45 cents a gallon.  </p>
<p>A 108,000 barrel per day (bpd) catalytic cracker at Petroleos de Venezuela's (PdVSA) Amuay refinery went down on Sunday due to problems with an air compressor, a PdVSA spokesman said. The spokesman said the refining unit would be running again by week's end.</p>
<p>The rise in gasoline prices took November crude to a contract high of $26.10 a barrel at a time when crude is already at five-year highs. But, November crude closed off 17 cents a barrel to $25.75 as the November  contract expired Tuesday and traders rolled positions into the December contract.</p>
<p>Heating oil prices fell on news Colonial Pipeline Co will make room on its 1.2 million bpd gasoline line to accommodate a surge in requests to ship distillates, especially heating oil, on its pipeline.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is reacting to Colonial's maximizing distillate deliveries by using its gasoline line,&quot; said John Bradberry, vice president of risk and inventory management at Continental Ozark Inc.</p>
<p>The Colonial Pipeline extends from Houston to Linden, New Jersey, on the edge of New York Harbor and includes a 960,000 bpd distillate line.</p>
<p>Colonial said requests to ship more distillates on its pipeline increased following a meeting between U.S. Energy Department officials and oil company executives to discuss a spike in heating oil prices related to record low inventories.</p>
