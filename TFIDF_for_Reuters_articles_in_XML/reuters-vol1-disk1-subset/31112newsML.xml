<title>UK: U.S. stocks mixed in London, Dow seen steady.</title>
<headline>U.S. stocks mixed in London, Dow seen steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. shares were narrowly mixed in light and featureless dealing in London after yesterday's whipsaw trading session.</p>
<p>London dealers said they saw little reaction to a second U.S. attack on Iraq, and were expecting the Dow -- down by some 50 points early in yesterday's session before ending with a 32-point gain -- to open steady.</p>
<p>Shares in U.S. oil companies, which rose after news of the initial U.S. raid, were flat in London.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not a lot going on at all. Trading has been spotty,&quot; said one dealer.  </p>
<p>Shares in Boeing Co climbed $1/8 to $90-3/4 after news that the aircraft manufacturer said it won a $1.18 billion order for seven 747-400 jumbo jets from Philippine Airlines.</p>
<p>McDonalds Corp shares slipped $3/8 to $46 in London in reaction to an article in the Wall Street Journal that said the fast-food restaurant's new burger was not doing well.</p>
<p>Shares in Digital Equipment slipped another $3/8 in London after stumbling $1-5/8 in New York yesterday after the company said orders were slow.</p>
<p>In other trading, the September S&amp;P 500 futures contract was 0.30 lower at 655.55 on Globex at 1028 GMT.  </p>
<p>The September 30-year Treasury bond futures contract was up 1/32 at 107-30/32. Trading volume was light.</p>
<p>Traders said they expect U.S. stock trading to grind to a halt until Friday's release of the August employment report. A strong set of figures is likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.</p>
