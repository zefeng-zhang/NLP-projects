<p>Otter Gold Mines Ltd said on Tuesday that gold production at its Tanami mine, north-west of Alice Springs in Australia, had risen to 32,835 ounces in the September quarter from 24,966 in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>It said the mine and plant was operating steadily above design capacity. Dry weather conditions and good equipment availability had contributed to the increased production.</p>
<p>Metallurgical performance improved, with Tanami gold recovery averaging 94.4 percent in the quarter against 92 percent in the June quarter. Plant operating costs also dropped significantly at the mine.  </p>
<p>Otter said investigations into the viability of underground mining below several pits in the Tanami region were producing encouraging results.</p>
<p>Otter is manager of the Tanami joint venture, in which it has a 60 percent equity stake.</p>
<p>In Otter's New Zealand joint venture at the Martha Hill mine near Waihi, production declined 10 percent over the quarter to 19,442 ounces. The company said the fall resulted from mining lower grade zones within the pit. Silver production fell to 150,194 ounces from 184,873 ounces.  </p>
<p>Otter holds a 32.94 percent equity interest in the Martha Hill mine.</p>
<p>As at September 30, the company had cash reserves of NZ$11.3 million and undrawn funds of NZ$12.3 million under its finance facility of AIDC Limited, with NZ$5.2 million outstanding under the facility as at that date.</p>
