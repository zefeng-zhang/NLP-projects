<title>NEW ZEALAND: ManFed rebukes NZ power companies for price rises.</title>

<p>Promises to tighten up on electricity retailers by Energy Minister Doug Kidd and Commerce Commission chairman Alan Bollard were like &quot;shutting the door after the horse has bolted&quot;, the New Zealand Manufacturers Federation said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It called the price increases &quot;totally reprehensible&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the year to June 1996 Statistics New Zealand figures show the price to commercial and industrial users rose 3.4 percent, and the price to the domestic consumer rose 6.2 percent,&quot; ManFed chief executive Simon Arnold said in a statement.  </p>
<p>He said ManFed estimated that the total price of electricity for both sectors had risen five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This was over a period when prices across all manufacturing only rose 0.2 percent, and across all producers 0.4 percent. Electricity price increases are way out of line,&quot; Arnold said.</p>
<p>Kidd on Wednesday said the government was considering tougher disclosure rules for power companies to sharpen competition in the electricity industry, while Bollard said the anti-monopolies Commerce Commission would increase its enforcement activity in the sector.  </p>
<p>But Arnold said the electricity price increases which had already taken place were &quot;totally reprehensible&quot; because the costs being faced by electricity companies had been going down.</p>
<p>&quot;Within the broad energy sector, costs dropped 3.6 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This suggests electricity companies increased their profits by nearly nine percent on what is largely a monopoly service.&quot;</p>
<p>Arnold suggested that Kidd and Bollard &quot;stop talking and get on their bikes&quot;.</p>
