<headline>RTRS-WEEK AHEAD in Australia markets-C/A top data.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The domestic data of major interest to Australian financial markets this week will be the July balance of payments data to be issued on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>The average forecast for the current account deficit is A$1.3 billion, in line with June's figure.</p>
<p>&quot;Provided that monthly trend current account deficits stabilise around or preferably under A$1.50 billion per month over the next few months, markets are likely to remain tolerant of the current account deficit for the time being,&quot; GIO Australia economists said in a report.</p>
<p>Second in terms of likely market impact would be the July retail trade data due on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>Average forecasts are for a 0.3 percent rise.</p>
<p>This would reconfirm relatively weak private consumption in recent months, and generally moderate economic activity, and should help underpin the bullish tone in domestic credit markets, Westpac economists said in a report.</p>
<p>The June quarter foreign debt data due on Wednesday is expected to show a modest fall due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar and is not likely to have any market impact, analysts said.</p>
<p>July building approvals on Friday are likely to be of low priority for the markets.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN BONDS (Fri: 10-yr cash yield 7.87 pct, 3-yr 7.09 pct)</p>
<p>The bond market goes into next week in a bullish mood following last week's budget and Standard &amp; Poor's revision in Australia's outlook to positive, and even the possibility that the Treasury could start its 1996/97 funding programme today has failed to daunt the market.</p>
<p>The Treasury said last week that it will start holding bond tenders again soon with the budget now out of the way, and as always it will load funding to the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Next week's data is unlikely to trip the market up with only a modest rise seen in retail trade and the current account deficit seen staying close to June's A$1.29 billion level.</p>
<p>But the market's bullish mood may be dampened on Monday by Friday's New York sharpy decline in U.S. Treasuries on fear of higher rates or impending inflationary pressures. The 30-year bond was driven down 1-13/32 to 97-14/32 and its yield up to 6.95 percent, the highest close since July 31.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (Fri: NY US$0.7912/17, local $0.7907/12)</p>
<p>The dollar ended last week on an upbeat note after gaining 3/4 cent in the wake of the budget to end around 79 cents.</p>
<p>Traders were looking for further progress this week if dual currency samurai demand turned out as strong as rumoured.</p>
<p>Traders said a break of key US$0.7935 resistance was needed to signal a new phase of the dollar's three week-old rally and set up a re-test of the 80 cent barrier which so frustrated bulls in early July.</p>
<p>Support was seen at US$0.7890 and US$0.7850, with many viewing US$0.7810 as the pivotal level once again.</p>
<p>Thursday's July current account deficit could underpin sentiment if it proves as low as market expectations of A$1.3 billion.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN SHARES (Fri: All Ords 2,292.9, up 18.3 points)</p>
<p>The Australian share market is likely to start the week on a positive note following its strong performance last week.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones average ended Friday down 10.73 at 5722.74.</p>
<p>In London on Friday, bullion was fixed at $387.50 an ounce.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index rose 66.2 points last week.</p>
<p>Behind the market's recent good mood has been a combination of positive factors including the better prospects for another interest rate cut following last Tuesday's budget as well as a likely Dow rally in the lead up to the U.S. presidential election in November.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally speaking the market is looking quite upbeat, I would anticipate steady gains over the week,&quot; said Jim Tredenick a dealer at Brisbane-based broker Nevitts.</p>
<p>This week is shaping up to be an important week for results with Comalco Ltd and Foster's Brewing Group Ltd due to report on Monday, Metway Bank Ltd and Howard Smith Ltd on Tuesday, Burns Philp and Co Ltd and Newcrest Mining Ltd and MIM Holdings Ltd and Brambles Industries Ltd on Friday.</p>
