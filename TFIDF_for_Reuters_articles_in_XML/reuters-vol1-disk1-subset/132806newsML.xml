<title>USA: Stepan sees Q4 hurt by maintenance, surfactants.</title>
<headline>Stepan sees Q4 hurt by maintenance, surfactants.</headline>
<dateline>NORTHFIELD, Ill. 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Stepan Co said Tuesday that its fourth quarter earnings will be tempered by a planned maintenance shutdown at its phthalic anhydride plant, coupled with weaker than expected surfactant profit margins.</p>
<p>&quot;We now expect German and Philippine start-up losses to reduce full year earnings by approximately 25 cents per share,&quot; F. Quinn Stepan, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;On the positive side, the Philippine operation should start reporting income in the fourth quarter and the German plant should begin to show improved results.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier, Stepan reported third quarter earnings of $0.39 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $0.08. Sales for the quarter rose to $137.9 million from $130.4 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Solid gains in sales volume precipitated the increase in net sales,&quot; Stepan said. &quot;Unfortunately, earnings did not meet our expectations due to weakening surfactant profit margins and start-up losses associated with the German acquisition and Philippine joint venture.&quot;</p>
<p>Losses for the German plant and Philippine joint venture lowered earnings by $0.16 a share for the quarter, the company said.  </p>
<p>Earnings from surfactants, which account for 75 percent of company revenues, were down despite a 15 percent increase in volume.  North American surfactant margins weakened due to competitive pressures and rather large unplanned domestic maintenance expenditures, the company said.</p>
<p>Lower European earnings resulted from disappointing profit margins partially attributable to start-up losses of the German plant.</p>
<p>Polymer earnings nearly doubled from the year-ago quarter as a result of a 25 percent increase in sales volume and improved margins. Polymer net sales were flat as a result of falling raw material costs.</p>
<p>Operating expenses declined by $7.2 million or 37 percent due to lower legal and environmental expenses.  The year ago quarter included an additional $5 million provision for possible environmental remediation costs, Stepan said.</p>
<p>The current quarter included a $3.3 million insurance recovery based on claims for coverage of environmental risks. Excluding legal and environmental costs, operating expense increases were largely attributable to higher salary expense and the addition of operating expenses for the German plant, the company said.</p>
