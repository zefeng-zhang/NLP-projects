<p>Australian and Japanese companies should engage in more coordinated investment and industrial cooperation activities in third countries and regions, Minoru Inouye, adviser to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, told a Australia-Japan Business Cooperation Committees meeting here.</p>
<p>Japanese and Australian companies have already established joint-ventures to build factories and provide management consulting and engineering services in Australia, he said.</p>
<p>Inouye said financial and capital markets in Australia and Japan needed to be further streamlined to meet the voracious demand for funds in the Asia-Pacific.  </p>
<p>The most important task was to enhance the financial functions of Australia and Japan by encouraging Australian and Japanese financial institutions to expand into each other's markets, Inouye said.</p>
<p>Inouye said there had been a &quot;very welcome&quot; return to Japanese direct investment in Australia.</p>
<p>In Japanese fiscal year 1995 (beginning April 1), investment in Australia almost doubled, increasing 91.5 percent to 256.1 billion yen (A$2.91 billion) over the previous year, he said.</p>
<p>This marked the end of a long downtrend in Japanese fiscal investment in Australia, which peaked in fiscal 1989, he said.  </p>
<p>At 5.2 percent of Japan's total overseas direct investment in fiscal 1995, Australia was the fourth highest recipient after the United States, with 44.1 percent, China, with 8.7 percent, and Britain, with 6.7 percent.</p>
<p>A cooperative framework also needed to be developed in the Asia-Pacific region in readiness for a financial crisis of the type which struck Mexico, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan and Australia should lead the way in creating a stable international financial system in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Inouye said a continued movement overseas by Japanese companies was likely to provide an almost structural background for a continued decline in Japan's current account surplus.</p>
<p>But a continued high national savings rate in Japan and stagnant private investment meant Japan's current account surplus was unlikely to continue shrinking at its present pace, he said. &quot;Japan will basically continue to have the world's largest surplus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Japan's current account surplus fell by more than 20 percent top US$99.6 billion in fiscal 1995.</p>
