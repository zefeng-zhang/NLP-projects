<p>Hurricane Fran, its winds at 115 mph (185 kph), moved toward the southeastern United States on Wednesday, surrounded by tropical storm winds advancing 290 miles (466 km), the National Hurricane Center reported.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was in effect for the northwestern Bahamas as Fran moved northwest across the Atlantic toward the United States at 12 mph (20 kph).</p>
<p>At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Fran was about 540 miles (869 km)  from Charleston, South Carolina and forecasters predicted she might make landfall on Thursday. Hurricane-strength winds extended 85 miles (136 km).</p>
<p>A hurricane watch area extended from Sebastian Inlet near Vero Beach, Florida, to Little River Inlet at the border of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>At Cape Canaveral, Fla., east of Orlando about halfway up the Florida coast, NASA managers ordered the space shuttle Atlantis moved back to its massive garage.</p>
<p>The shuttle was expected to reach the safety of its giant assembly building by about 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT).</p>
<p>Atlantis, already six weeks late because of rocket problems, was due to blast off on September 14 on a mission to pick up U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid from the Russian Mir space station and drop off her replacement, John Blaha.</p>
<p>Forecasters said Fran began a gradual northerly turn, diminishing Fran's threat to the heavily populated southern portion of Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;It will lessen the chances of landfall in the southern Florida region and increase the chances in the north Florida to the North Carolina region...,&quot; said Bill Frederick, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.</p>
<p>The Club Med in the Bahamian island San Salvador closed its beach as Fran generated high waves and brisk winds. With rough seas, heavy rain and active thunderstorms expected as Fran's edge brushed the islands, residents of Abaco, Cat Island and Eleuthera were advised to stay indoors.</p>
<p>&quot;Depending upon the speed of the storm we're looking to meet sometime Thursday afternoon. If it starts to make funny changes we're going to meet sooner,&quot; said Clarence Skinner, head of the emergency control group in Dare County, North Carolina, noting that Fran would only get stronger as it moved over warm ocean waters.</p>
<p>In Dare County, which includes Cape Hatteras on North Carolina's Outer Banks, &quot;no swimming&quot; advisories were lifted at beaches for the first time since Edouard threatened the state late last week.</p>
<p>Edouard was declared extra-tropical before dawn as it moved in the north Atlantic southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
