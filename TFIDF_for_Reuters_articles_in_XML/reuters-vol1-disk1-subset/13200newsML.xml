<dateline>MACAU 1996-08-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior Macau police officer and bomb expert denied on Sunday that he was behind a wave of bombings in the territory and claimed explosives found in his home were merely teaching materials.</p>
<p>The officer, who was not named by police and declined to be identified, told reporters he was taken in by police on Friday and interrogated about the bombings but was later released.</p>
<p>He said explosive devices found in his flat were only used as material for lectures to other officers.</p>
<p>The officer, in his 30s, was arrested after several months of undercover investigations, police sources said.</p>
<p>Macau, a Portuguese-administered territory near Hong Kong which reverts to Chinese rule in 1999, has been hit by 12 bomb attacks since December 1995, injuring eight people.</p>
<p>The most recent, on August 9, blew up outside a karaoke bar and former Thai gigolo club, shattering nearby windows and damaging six parked cars.</p>
<p>Police say the such blasts are favourite warning signals among criminal gangs in financial disputes.</p>
