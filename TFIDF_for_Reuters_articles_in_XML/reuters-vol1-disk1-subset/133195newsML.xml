<p>NATO said on Tuesday it would make determined efforts to put an end to a bombing campaign over the last two weeks, apparently aimed at scaring Bosnian Moslem refugees out of resettling in their old homes.</p>
<p>A NATO spokesman said peacekeepers would increase patrols in high-risk areas for potential bombings and use &quot;techical means&quot; to pinpoint explosions and catch the bombers.</p>
<p>Major Brett Boudreau said there had been some 70 explosions since October 10, most of them in former Moslem villages in Serb territory in northeastern Bosnia where previous occupants are returning to rebuild their war-damaged homes.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence we have is fairly clear -- destroyed homes where the day before homes were fine...homes reconstructed by Moslems and areas where it would be expected that Moslems would return and re-establish homes,&quot; Boudreau said.</p>
<p>He said the latest incident occured in the north of Bosnia, near the strategic town of Brcko, where two Moslem houses under reconstruction were damaged by explosions on Monday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, NATO reported it had found booby-trap mines in a deserted Moslem village in Serb territory. Had they gone off, the local power station would have been seriously damaged.</p>
<p>&quot;The use of land mines as a destruction device suggests at least a possibility of some kind of military involvement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Should this prove to be the case, (NATO's) Implementation Forces will obviously take strong and determined measures to deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Boudreau said NATO had still not identified who was responsible for the blasts but was investigating the possibility of an organised campaign to discourage Moslems from moving back to their homes.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the cause, it obviously contributes to inter-entity tension and frustrates the procedure for orderly (refugee) returns,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If caught, bombers would be handed over to local authorities, but Boudreau said NATO would make any arrests public to bring international pressure to bear on local police forces to take firm action.</p>
<p>The commander of NATO forces in Bosnia, U.S. Admiral Joseph Lopez, has written to Bosnia's three national leaders, urging their support to end the bombings, Boudreau said.</p>
