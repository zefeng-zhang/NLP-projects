<p>Finnish forestry group Enso Oy said on Tuesday it expected to post a profit in the final tertial (September-December), and that full-year 1996 earnings would be satisfactory.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the market situation is more difficult than expected, final tertial earnings will show a profit and full-year earnings will be satisfactory,&quot; Enso said in a statement with its January-August interim report.  </p>
<p>&quot;Entering the autumn, the market has not improved in line with expectations. Although economic growth has started to pick up in Western Europe, the impact on the forest industry is being felt more slowly than anticipated,&quot; Enso said.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty over the prices for market pulp and newsprint could make the market difficult. Because of new production capacity, some of which is already in use, it is taking longer to restore the market to balance,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Enso said its financial results for the four months to end-August, a 57 percent fall in profit after financial items to 1.16 billion markka, had been in line with its expectations. @</p>
<p>&quot;However, the prospects for the financial result for the rest of the year are not as bright as they appeared to be in the spring,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>In 1995, Enso's profit after financial items was 3.52 billion markka.</p>
