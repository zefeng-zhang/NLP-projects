<p>Fifteen-year-old Martina Hingis struck a blow for the youth brigade and claimed the highest-seeded scalp of the U.S. Open so far by upending third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario on Monday.</p>
<p>The 16th-seeded Swiss teen opened second-week play with a 6-1 3-6 6-4 upset of the 1994 Open champion to reach the second Grand Slam quarter-final of her fledgling career after becoming the youngest-ever Australian Open quarter-finalist in January.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a Grand Slam, and Arantxa Sanchez is not an easy player,&quot; said the beaming Hingis, who leaped for joy after stopping the Spaniard. Sanchez had reached the final of her last five tournaments, including the French Open, Wimbledon and the Olympics.</p>
<p>&quot;I just had my best match today, and I'm very happy about it,&quot; Hingis said.</p>
<p>But world No. 1 and defending champion Steffi Graf showed that if the torch is to be passed, it will have to be taken by force.</p>
<p>Fraulein Forehand took on 15-year-old Russian up-and-comer Anna Kournikova in the second Stadium Court match on a hot, sunny day and needed just 51 minutes to pound out a 6-2 6-1 victory over the projected star.</p>
<p>The unusually poised Russian qualifier managed to break Graf once in each set, but the German superstar shrugged off the setbacks, breaking Kournikova three times in each, converting all three break points in the second.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess maybe it was a little easier than probably everybody expected,&quot; Graf said. &quot;When you're 15, you try to go for a lot of shots, and you have nothing to lose.</p>
<p>&quot;I figured it would be tougher,&quot; the four-time Open champion said. &quot;She's gutsy. Experience is missing, but she definitely has the shots.&quot;</p>
<p>In the quarter-finals, Graf will face 24th-ranked Austrian veteran Judith Wiesner, who coasted to a 6-0 6-3 fourth-round win over Italian Rita Grande.</p>
<p>Graf, who will be playing her 12th consecutive U.S. Open quarter-final, looks a safe bet to reach the semifinals. She holds a perfect 9-0 career mark against Wiesner.</p>
<p>Hingis lived up to her famous namesake, Martina Navratilova, in zooming through the first set in just 19 minutes with a mere four unforced errors along the way.</p>
<p>She and Sanchez traded early breaks in the second set, but an overrule by chair umpire Jane Harvey in the seventh game completely changed the tone of the match.</p>
<p>At deuce for the fourth time in an exciting game, Hingis hit a forehand that the chair called long after the line judge had signalled it in.</p>
<p>Hingis became unhinged by the call and television replays showed that the ball had, in fact, hit squarely on the baseline.</p>
<p>The Swiss teen quickly lost the next point, giving Sanchez the game, and hurled her racket at her chair as she stormed off court for the changeover.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes it makes you really angry,&quot; Hingis said. &quot;I'm lucky that I could come back.&quot;</p>
<p>Still rattled, Hingis promptly lost the next four games, giving Sanchez the second set and a 2-0 third-set lead. But where most 15-year-olds would have been finished, Hingis managed to regain her composure.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very disappointed with myself, because I let her get back,&quot; said Sanchez, who assisted the Swiss teen's comeback by making 22 of her 52 unforced errors in the deciding set.</p>
<p>Hingis broke Sanchez in the fourth game to level the set at 2-2 and captured the Spaniard's serve for the sixth time in the eighth game for a 5-3 edge.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hingis appeared to act her age, playing a terribly nervous and tentative game while serving for the match as the Barcelona battler broke at love.</p>
<p>But Sanchez was unable to take advantage as Hingis put the Spaniard in a 15-40 hole to reach double match point.</p>
<p>The match point was halted midway as an empty water bottle got lose and rolled toward the court, breaking the tension.</p>
<p>But when they played the pivotal point over, Sanchez sailed a backhand slice well out and Hingis had her big victory.</p>
<p>Graf said of Hingis and Kournakova: &quot;It's important to have these new faces come up, especially since in the last few years, there hasn't been that much excitement around.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to know the future of women's tennis is going to show up.&quot;</p>
