<p>Most Taiwanese support Vice-President Lien Chan's secretive visit to Ukraine last week even though the move infuriated neighbouring Beijing, a poll published on Sunday showed.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out by the mass circulation China Times newspaper on August 23, said 60 percent of 848 people interviewed supported Lien's Kiev mission in a trip respondents saw as worth risking China's ire.</p>
<p>Only 10.6 percent said they did not support the visit.</p>
<p>Some 46 percent said Lien's visit had a positive impact on raising Taiwan's international status, against 5.4 percent who disagreed.</p>
<p>Lien, who returned to Taiwan late on Thursday after his three-day trip to Ukraine, has said he spoke to people &quot;of all levels&quot; in the former Soviet bloc nation but declined to say if he met President Leonid Kuchma.</p>
<p>Ukraine, bearing the brunt of China's anger, flatly denied Lien and Kuchma met, although Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told Reuters he found Beijing's furious reaction to Lien's visit &quot;out of proportion&quot;.</p>
<p>China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, delivered a note of protest to Ukraine's ambassador in Beijing and cancelled a visit by a high-level delegation.</p>
<p>Beijing says Taiwan is not entitled to foreign ties and has growled at allies it sees as giving political or diplomatic support to the island's leaders.</p>
<p>Lien surfaced in Kiev on Tuesday, two days after vanishing in New York after a state visit to the Dominican Republic, one of just 30 countries in the world which recognise the island instead of China.</p>
