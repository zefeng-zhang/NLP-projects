<p>Belgians are sceptical about their government's promises to reform the justice system, a poll published by newspaper La Derniere Heure on Tuesday showed.</p>
<p>Asked whether they thought Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene was sincere when he promised far-reaching reforms of the justice system, 65 percent of 1,000 Belgians polled said &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Only 26.3 percent said they did believe him, while 8.7 percent had no opinion.</p>
<p>Dehaene promised to act after 250,000 people marched through Brussels on Sunday to voice their lack of confidence in police and magistrates investigating a paedophile ring which has murdered four girls.</p>
<p>On Monday all major political parties backed Dehaene's proposal to reduce political influence in the appointment and promotion of top judges.</p>
<p>Sunday's rally -- by people from all walks of life and from both sides of the Dutch-French language divide -- was an unprecedented display of anger over the huge influence political parties have in Belgium's legal system.</p>
<p>It was the culmination of two months of public outrage over the paedophile murder investigation and over discoveries of bungling in the investigation into the 1991 assassination of socialist politician Andre Cools.</p>
