<p>England may field a third division team against Italy next month after talks between the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) and EPRUC, the body representing senior club sides, ground to a halt on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement the RFU said EPRUC had threatened legal action against both the union and the International Rugby Board (IRB).</p>
<p>&quot;The RFU and EPRUC met today, when the RFU came with a proposed agreement and a will to settle. This agreement had been circulated to EPRUC on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;EPRUC negotiators refused to discuss the proposed agreement. Instead, their lawyer threatened legal action against the IRB, the RFU and individuals concerning restraint of trade, abuse of broadcasting rights and alleged breach of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;EPRUC also said that: `It was not a given that England players will be available for the Italy game'.</p>
<p>The failure to find common ground could result in EPRUC, which represents the 24 teams in the first and second divisions of the English league, breaking away from the union.</p>
<p>At the centre of the dispute is EPRUC's insistence on a far greater say in running competitions and also demanding an increased share of money stemming from internationals.</p>
