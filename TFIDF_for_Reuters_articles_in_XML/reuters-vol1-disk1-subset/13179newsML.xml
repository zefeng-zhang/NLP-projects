<p>Australia's gold industry is poised to become the world's second largest producer within three years, a leading gold market analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;If this forecast is achieved, the (Australian) gold industry will be consolidated as the nation's second largest commodity export earner,&quot; gold market analyst John Cairns told a weekend gold conference on the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>The Australian industry should be able to main growth in production near the current level of 300 tonnes a year and reach an annual production rate of 350 tonnes, replacing the United States in second place by the end of the century, he said.  </p>
<p>Cairns, formerly with the Australian Bureau of Resource and Agricultural Economics (ABARE) governnment research unit, said world gold prices which averaged US$384 in 1995 and are forecast to reach $393 this year and should reach $440 an ounce by 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in (Australian) exploration investment over the past few years is paying dividends,&quot; Cairns said.</p>
<p>With gold exploration currently attracting more than A$500 million a year, the Australian industry had now defined more than 4,000 tonnes of economically-mineable gold in reserves, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is approximately double the reserves of five years ago, despite the record production levels,&quot; Cairns said.</p>
<p>He said reserves were expected to be at least maintained at these levels through to the end of the decade as a result of current and expected exploration investment and the further development of exploration technologies.</p>
<p>South Africa should maintain its top position in world production but large amounts of capital investment by South America, Africa and Asia should see those countries emerging to take solid positions in the middle world rankings within five years, Cairns said.  </p>
<p>China, which produced just over 135 tonnes of gold last year should be producing 200 tonnes annually by the end of the decade, Cairns said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a survey of the top 24 Australian gold companies represented at the conference forecast gold production by them this year of more than 4.3 million ounces and anticipated spending more than A$247 million on exploration, stockbroking firm Lance Jones Ltd's senior resource analyst, Brett O'Donovan told the conference.</p>
