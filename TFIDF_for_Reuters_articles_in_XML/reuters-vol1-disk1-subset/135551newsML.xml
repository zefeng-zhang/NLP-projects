<headline>Prodi rules out decree for Stet watchdog.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said in a newspaper interview he was against passing a decree to create a watchdog authority for the telecoms sector, a necessary step for the privatisation of state telecoms holding Stet.</p>
<p>The government wants to sell off Stet by the end of next March but before the flotation can go ahead parliament must approve a bill setting up a sector watchdog authority.</p>
<p>The draft law is still stuck in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not agree with creating the authority by decree because I fear the financial markets would not like a privatisation carried out like that,&quot; he told the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.</p>
<p>Government decrees cut through red tape and take immediate effect but lapse unless they are ratified by parliament and passed into law with a certain period.</p>
<p>The measures on the authority are currently before the upper house, the Senate. They must then return to the lower Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the Authority is set up by December, the Stet sale will be carried out according to plan, otherwise we will lose credibility. But I am sure parliament will do its job,&quot; Prodi said.</p>
<p>Asked if the government aimed to resort to a golden share for the Stet sale, Prodi said a golden share would only be used &quot;to guarantee that Stet did not pass into the control of foreign groups.&quot; If the golden share &quot;became the means to move from a real privatisation to a false privatisation, then I am against it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After the Stet sale, the government's privatisation calendar envisaged the sale of motorway operator Autostrade, Prodi said.</p>
<p>As for the complete privatisation of energy group ENI, Prodi said &quot;it will be fully privatised&quot; but did not indicate any timetable.</p>
<p>&quot;We must take into account the risks of blocking up the stock market and the fact that all major public enterprises have been sold bit by bit,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>For the second tranche of Eni shares currently on offer, Prodi said &quot;we had considered a larger second tranche, of around 12-13 percent against the 8.75 percent decided, but the experts advised us against it.&quot;</p>
