<p>Fired Russian security chief Alexander Lebed predicted on Tuesday that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would be dismissed by the middle of next month.</p>
<p>&quot;He's an extra person, he's become an extra person, an unnecessary one,&quot; Lebed said in an interview on the ABC News programme &quot;Nightline&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;According to my observations, the next person who will be dismissed, probably by the middle of November, will be Viktor Chernomyrdin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin fired Lebed last week saying he could no longer tolerate the 46-year-old general's lack of team spirit and obvious ambition to become Russia's next leader.</p>
<p>Lebed had been drawn into an increasingly bitter power struggle with other Kremlin officials since Yeltsin said on Sept. 5 he was preparing to undergo heart surgery.</p>
<p>In excerpts from the interview released by ABC, Lebed blamed presidential chief of staff Anatoly Chubais for convincing Yeltsin to dismiss him.</p>
<p>&quot;He was the only person who can have access to the president. He is the person who has created this artificial isolation of not only me but of other state figures from the president,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lebed accused Chubais of feeding Yeltsin &quot;distorted information.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the president was lied to very professionally. The president heeded these liars and made his decision. I'm sorry for the president,&quot; Lebed said.</p>
<p>Lebed joined Yeltsin's administration after coming third with 11 million votes in June in the first round of presidential elections. The transfer of his support was crucial in helping the president to overcome the challenge of communist rival Gennady Zyuganov.</p>
