<p>Poland's biggest chemicals trader, the state-controlled Ciech SA, is likely to enter the Warsaw bourse in late March or early April 1997, Ciech's president said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Zdzislaw Matkiewicz told a news conference that the flotation would reduce the treasury's stake in the company, now at 53 percent, to five percent or less.</p>
<p>The remaining 47 percent now belongs to numerous, mostly state-owned companies from the chemical sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that Ciech's shares will hit the bourse at the turn of the first and second quarter of 1997,&quot; Matkiewicz said.</p>
<p>Last month, the foreign trade ministry, which represents the treasury as Ciech's owner, picked a consortium of NM Rothschild and Sons Ltd, the Polish state, Pekao SA bank and a consulting firm Access, as its advisor in the privatsation of the company.</p>
<p>Matkiewicz said the planned sale of a large part of Ciech's coming closed new issue of between 19.8 million and 39.6 million shares to the fully state-owned firm Chemia Polska Ltd would not hamper the privatisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The new issue is needed to boost Ciech's capital before the bourse listing and finance new aqusitions in the chemical sector,&quot; Matkiewicz said. Apart from Chemia, the new shares will be offered to Ciech's current shareholders, he added.</p>
<p>Chemia was set up by the foreign trade ministry to invest in Polish state-owned chemical firms and consolidate the sector by creating a holding.</p>
<p>&quot;Chemia Polska is the representative of the state treasury and the treasury, with its shares (in Ciech) appointed Chemia to take over the new stock,&quot; Matkiewicz said.</p>
<p>The sale of 19.8 million new shares would increase Ciech's capital by 50 percent.</p>
<p>According to Ciech officials, Chemia and the Investment Credit Guarantee Corporation, an exports guarantee body also overseen by the foreign trade ministry, are expectd to take over more than 10 million of Ciech's new shares.</p>
<p>However, Jerzy Reszka, the president of Ciech's supervisory board, s aid that although Ciech's board had nothing against the consolidation of the chemical sector in general, it disagreed with the methods of the ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The board, at its last meeting, disagreed with the (ministry's) proposal of handing over shares to the Investment Credit Corporation and...distanced itself from Chemia Polska as a body with which it had not cooperated,&quot; Reszka said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have nothing against the consolidation of the chemical sector but the current methods are foreign to us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Matkiewicz said Ciech, which employees 750, expected a 51 million zloty net profit this year against 50 million zlotys in 1995 and 48 million in 1994.</p>
<p>He said the firm, which ranks among Poland's largest companies, expected sales to rise 15.3 percent this year against $960 million in 1995 and $1.3 billion in 1994.</p>
