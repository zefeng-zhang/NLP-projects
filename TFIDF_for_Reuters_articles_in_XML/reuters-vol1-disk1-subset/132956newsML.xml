<title>UK: LIFFE coffee ends sharply up on stocks, Colombia.</title>
<headline>LIFFE coffee ends sharply up on stocks, Colombia.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Robusta coffee futures retained sharp gains by the close on funds and arbitrage buying, inspired by the surprisingly large draw in U.S. certified stocks.</p>
<p>Traders said growing worries over Colombian supplies following a prolonged strike by truck drivers also lent a bullish tone to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The Colombian strike news is obviously more important to the market than the certifieds,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Origin selling seemed to have dried up as producers waited for much-higher levels while roasters were well-covered in the nearbys, traders said,</p>
<p>The most-active November/January spread, a barometer of nearby supply availability, stood at $122 at the close after touching a high of $143, as funds sold January to cover their short positions in November.</p>
<p>Heavily-traded January closed $40 higher at $1,427 a tonne while front-month November firmed $49 at $1,549.</p>
<p>The day's volume, dominated by the Nov/Jan switch, totalled 9,202 lots at the finish.</p>
<p>U.S. certified stocks fell 24,391 60-kg bags in the week ended October 18 to 5,583 bags, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said on Monday.</p>
<p>But what was seen as more bullish is that no coffee was pending certification, greatly diminishing chances for a build in stocks next week.</p>
<p>Some traders said the strong market reaction to the stock news could be more psychological than anything.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are meaningless. If the market trades about 100 million bags a year, then 25,000 bags don't really make a big difference,&quot; said one. Traders said the market was closely watching the situation in key grower Colombia after a week-old truck drivers' strike was said to have halted exports.</p>
<p>The country's coffee chief Jorge Cardenas said on Tuesday the strike had paralysed the nation's coffee industry and forced delays in the shipment of about 250,000 60-kg bags of coffee promised for delivery in October.</p>
