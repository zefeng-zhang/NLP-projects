<p>Indonesia said on Wednesday that its trade surplus rose in the first half of the year, helped by an increase in oil exports, and analysts forecast a further advance if oil prices stay high.</p>
<p>Information Minister Harmoko told reporters after a monthly cabinet meeting that the January-June trade surplus was $2.3 billion against $2.0 billion in the same six-month period of last year.</p>
<p>Exports rose to $23.49 billion from $21.24 billion, he said, while imports rose to $21.19 billion from $19.25 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts said more gains were likely in the coming months if this week's increase in oil prices is sustained. Indonesia's oil exports form a major chunk of its trade balance, and rose in January-June to $5.42 billion from $5.27 billion last year.</p>
<p>Crude prices have shot up this week in response to tensions in the Middle East, reaching post-Gulf War highs on Tuesday following the U.S. missile strike on Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;The key question is whether the rise will be sustained,&quot; said an analyst with a Singapore bank. &quot;Indonesia's oil is already contracted out for a month or so, so any effect on the trade balance will only be forthcoming if the rises are sustained for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Structurally, it may not be a good thing for Indonesia,&quot; the analyst added. &quot;The urgency to restructure the economy away from dependence on oil may be diluted if crude prices prevail at higher levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto told reporters that non-oil exports had also increased as a result of the government policy of weaning the economy off its dependence on oil.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken concrete steps to boost our non-oil exports and we will continue our efforts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Ong, an economist at the Singapore-based I.D.E.A. think tank, said she did not expect the rise in crude prices to be sustained, and forecast little effect on the Indonesian economy.</p>
<p>She added, however, that a fall in imports in June to $3.95 billion from $3.97 billion in June 1995 was significant because it could signify that government efforts to control imports were bearing fruit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too early to say if it is a trend, but it is a figure we will be watching closely,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Harmoko also announced that inflation in August was 0.27 percent month-on-month against 0.68 percent in July.</p>
<p>Analysts said the figure was in line with forecasts, and added that inflation would reach about 7.0 percent year-on-year by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>President Suharto called last month for annual inflation to be brought down below five percent, although that target is looking extremely hard to achieve.</p>
<p>Inflation in 1995 was 8.6 percent, and cumulative inflation so far this year is about 4.98 percent.</p>
