<p>Morocco's largest private ONA Group bought controlling stakes in four mines, including a silver and copper mine, at the equivalent of $75 million, a group spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The privatisation ministry launched an international tender in March to sell four Moroccan mines -- silver, copper, fluorite, cobalt -- in one lot at at a minimum price of 643.8 million dirhams.  </p>
<p>&quot;ONA group purchased the four mines at the price set by the government which is 643.8 million dirhams,&quot; Abdelaziz Abarro, managing director of ONA's mining sector, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The biggest purchase was of mining Societe Metallurgique d'Imiter (SMI), in which the state offered its majority 69 percent holding, or 668,380 shares. It valued the stake at a minimum 448.9 million dirhams.  </p>
<p>SMI, located in southern Morocco, has a capital of 96.7 million dirhams and registered a turnover of 311 million dirhams in 1995, Abarro said.</p>
<p>He said ONA and the privatisation ministry agreed that ONA's subsidiary MANAGEM holding would buy 36.07 percent of SMI. Then SMI would buy the state stakes in the three remaining companies, respectively CTT, SOMIFER and SAMINE by end 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining state stake in SMI or 33 percent is expected to be floated on the Casablanca stock market in the first half of 1997,&quot; Abarro said, adding that it would be the first mining company to be listed on the Bourse.  </p>
<p>Morocco has 46 listed companies on the stock market, including four subsidiaries of ONA Group.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales of ONA mining division totalled 956 million dirhams, up 17 percent, following high production of non-iron metals and higher prices,&quot; a Casablanca Finance Intermediation (CFI) analyst said.</p>
<p>CFI forecasts for ONA mining division up to 157 million dirhams consolidated net profits in 1996. Abarro agreed with the forecast but declined comment. He said that after provisions SMI's net income should come close to 1995 earnings of 50 million dirhams.</p>
<p>The other mines are copper producer Societe Miniere de Bou-Gaffer (SOMIFER), fluorite mining company Societe Anonyme d'Entreprise Miniere (SAMINE) and Cobalt mine compagnie de Tifnout Tiranimine (CTT). The state sold 40 percent of CTT, 35 percent of SAMINE and 34 of SOMIFER.  </p>
<p>Abarro said the four mines registered in 1995 the following turnover: 311 million dirhams by SMI, 147 million dirhams by CTT, 134 million dirhams by SOMIFER, and SAMINE 112 million dirhams.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect better business for the four mines in 1996 than the turnover registered last year,&quot; Abarro said but gave no figures.</p>
<p>ONA said proven reserves for SMI were eight years at an average of 200 tonnes per year. CTT was five to six years with an average of 450 tonnes.</p>
<p>It said that proven reserves for SOMIFER stood at nearly two years and SAMINE nearly eight years.</p>
<p>The four mines were on a list of 114 state entreprises slated for privatisation by end 1998.</p>
