<headline>Peters, Bolger tight-lipped after NZ talks.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand's caretaker National Party government and the nationalist New Zealand First Party held their first talks on coalition-building on Monday, but neither side was prepared to comment in detail.</p>
<p>&quot;We made good progress, but I hope I can make the same progress towards that door,&quot; New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said as he tried to squeeze past a scrum of reporters.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger said the two sides would meet again at 2 p.m. (0100 GMT) on Wednesday, the same day NZ First is due to hold its first talks with the Labour Party.  </p>
<p>New Zealand First, with 17 members of parliament, holds the balance of power after an inconclusive general election on October 12.</p>
<p>National and allies on the centre-right have 53 seats in the 120-member parliament. Labour has 37 and the left-wing Alliance won 13. The conservative National Party has governed since 1990. National and Labour both aim to form a government with support from New Zealand First, which has said it will negotiate with both simultaneously in a process that could take many weeks.</p>
<p>Bolger and Peters made no further comment on the initial talks, which lasted about an hour and 40 minutes.  </p>
