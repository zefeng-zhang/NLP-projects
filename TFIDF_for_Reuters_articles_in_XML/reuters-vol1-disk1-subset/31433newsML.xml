<p>Hungary confirmed that it will sign a friendship treaty with Romania in the Romanian city of Timisoara, on September 16.</p>
<p>&quot;Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn and Romanian President Ion Iliescu will meet in Timisoara for the signing of the treaty on Monday the 16th in Timisoara,&quot; Horn's spokeswoman Agnes Koroncz told Reuters.</p>
<p>Horn's office said the treaty will be signed by the two prime ministers Horn and Romania's Nicolae Vacaroiou.</p>
<p>Timisoara is part of Transylvania, which belonged to Hungary before 1920 and has a large ethnic Hungarian population.</p>
<p>The announcement of the signing came after the Hungarian parliament overwhelmingly rejected an opposition bid for a review of the treaty's terms.</p>
<p>Opponents of the treaty, which enshrines protective rights for ethnic minorities and renounces any claims by either country over the other's territory, had complained the accord addresses only rights of individuals and not the collective rights of the 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.</p>
<p>The governing parties of both countries are determined to push through the pact, with Romania's ruling Party of Social Democracy going to the extent of dumping its anti-Hungarian coalition partner for its opposition to the deal.</p>
<p>The treaty, four years in the making, should end disputes over the status of Romania's ethnic Hungarians and improve economic and military relations between the two central European neighbours.</p>
