<headline>Deutsche Telekom shares higher in grey market.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in German telecoms monopoly Deutsche Telekom AG, set for flotation on November 18, traded well above their initial price range of 25-30 marks in the &quot;grey market&quot; on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said prices as high as 39 marks were being quoted for the stock in dealings on the unofficial grey market, 30 percent above the top end of the official range.</p>
<p>The grey market refers to the market provided by brokers prior to a formal offering which is not subject to official controls. Shares are sold in advance of the offering and then the contracts are honoured when the IPO actually takes place.</p>
<p>Munich brokerage Uto Baader said the shares were trading between 37 and 39 marks, Frankfurt brokers Ballmaier &amp; Schulz said prices were between 38 and 38.5 marks, while another Frankfurt broker said trades were occuring from 34 to 36 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers also said there was strong interest in the grey market in Telekom shares.</p>
<p>The first tranche of Deutsche Telekom -- 500 million shares -- is to be offered on November 18 in Europe's largest-ever IPO. The offer is open to subscriptions from October 22 to November 14.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom said earlier that the price range for shares in its IPO next month would be between 25 and 30 marks each. A final price for the share issue will be set during the weekend of November 16-17.</p>
