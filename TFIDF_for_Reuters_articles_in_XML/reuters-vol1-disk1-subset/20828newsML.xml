<p>Thousands of farmers threw up surprise blockades on roads across France overnight, stopping and checking lorries suspected of importing non-European Union beef in protest at falling prices following the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>The FNSEA farmers union, which had organised the operation in complete secrecy, said about 15,000 farmers set up blockades on several main roads and at motorway toll gates in many areas to carry out spot checks on cargoes.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very happy with today's mobilisation. The aim of the checks is to ensure that both producers and consumers benefit from complete openness on the origin of meat,&quot; FNSEA head Luc Guyot told Europe-1 radio.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be inflexible,&quot; he said, adding that checks were still continuing although the great majority of trucks checked had been cleared. By 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), more than 2,000 lorries had been stopped and searched.</p>
<p>About a dozen trucks, Guyot said, had cargoes of suspect origin. &quot;If the imports are not OK then we will hand them over to authorities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>European beef sales plunged after Britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).</p>
<p>The French farmers staged their protest on the eve of a European Union meeting on how to counter the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>On the Franco-Belgian border, one Dutch driver who resisted orders to have his load searched had the tyres of his lorry punctured. His cargo was handed over to local customs officials.</p>
<p>In the Losere region, farmers who stopped a truck found frozen meat among more than 500 kg of frozen fish.</p>
<p>The blockades coincided with surprise protests called in a host of cities and towns. In Laval, farmers unloaded veal in the streets. A group of protesters occupied the offices of the prefecture (local government authority) in the Creuse region.</p>
<p>Near Grenoble, 100 farmers occupied a slaughterhouse at Hieres sur Amby to check the origin of meat, local gendarmerie paramilitary police reported.</p>
<p>Asked whether he was lobbying for a ban on beef imports from outside the European Union, Guyot answered: &quot;When we talk about stopping the fall in prices, it's crucial that we start by dealing with imports. We don't want to close borders but we want agreements to be totally respected.&quot;</p>
