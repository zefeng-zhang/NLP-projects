<p>The London Stock Exchange launched its new integrated trading and information computer system, Sequence 6, on Tuesday, the last stage in a three-year programme to take the market into the next century.</p>
<p>The new system will complete the introduction of electronic trading begun at the time of the &quot;Big Bang&quot; shake up of the London market in 1986 which ended business on the floor of the exchange.</p>
<p>Sequence 6 will provide the basis for new electronic trading in the top blue-chip shares once the structure of a new order-driven trading regime is agreed and implemented in 1997.</p>
<p>That will signal the end of the current, quote-driven system where prices are set exclusively by dealers authorised to act as &quot;market-makers&quot; and deals are struck over the telephone.</p>
<p>It will also enable electronic as well as telephone-based trading in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the Seats -- Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service -- market for less liquid stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted that Sequence 6 has been implemented successfully, on time and under budget. The launch has gone very well today and the users appear to be very happy,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the exchange.</p>
<p>However, some market-makers said they experienced problems in posting prices, citing difficulties with the Reuters system.</p>
<p>A Reuters spokesman said the company's link to Sequence 6 was operating as planned but that there was an unrelated, temporary operational problem with feeds from several European exchanges including London which affected prices in the morning.</p>
<p>The completion of the Sequence programme at a cost of 81 million pounds ($126 million) will help ensure that London retains its competitive edge and reduce costs for the market and its participants, the exchange said.</p>
<p>During extensive testing over five weekends this summer, the new trading system succesfully coped with up to five times the average levels of daily activity in the London market, it added.</p>
<p>The completion of the project, on time and nearly five million pounds ahead of budget, will come as a relief to the exchange after its ill-fated and costly attempt at building a paperless share-settlement system -- TAURUS -- was abandoned four years ago.</p>
<p>The collapse of the project resulted in the resignation of then chief executive Peter Rawlins and subsequent involvement of the Bank of England in supervising the development of Crest, a replacement for the Exchange's antiquated Talisman system.</p>
<p>It may also mark a turnaround in its fortunes after a year which began with the sacking of its chief executive, Michael Lawrence, amid disagreement over how to counter competition from markets abroad. ($1=.6415 Pound)</p>
