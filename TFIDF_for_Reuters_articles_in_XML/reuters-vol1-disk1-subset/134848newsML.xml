<p>The German government on Tuesday said data from the first half of the year showing sharply falling foreign investment in Europe's largest economy means more must be done to improve conditions for investment.</p>
<p>The economics ministry said direct foreign investment in Germany by foreign companies totalled eight billion marks in the first half of 1996, down from 11.9 billion marks in the first six months of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures, of course, are not as meaningful as the full-year data because during the course of the year significant revisions will be made,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the numbers show clearly that conditions must be improved in order to increase Germany's attraction to foreign investors,&quot; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>Foreign investors transferred a total of 8.6 billion marks out of Germany in the first half of the year, creating a net cash outflow by foreigners of 610 million marks, compared with a cash inflow of 6.4 billion marks in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>The focus of foreign investment in Germany in the first half of the year was in telecommuications, investment firms and real estate companies.</p>
<p>German net direct investment abroad totalled 16.4 billion marks in the first half of 1996, down from the record high of 28.4 billion marks in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>The European Union remained the most important region for German foreign investment, but investment in the region fell to 8.15 billion marks from 19.5 billion marks.</p>
<p>The second most important market for investment was the United States, where German firms invested 2.5 billion marks, down from 5.6 billion marks.</p>
<p>The strongest growth in direct investment abroad was seen in Asia, where investment by German companies surged to 2.3 billion marks in the first half of the year from 507 million marks during the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>More than half of the investments were made in Japan, where German direct investment jumped to 1.23 billion marks from 83 million marks in the first half of the previous year.</p>
<p>The most important targets for investment by German companies were banks and investment firms, manufacturers of electrical power equipment, the chemical industry and real estate firms.</p>
