<title>RUSSIA: Salomon sold $1 bln Russian MinFins in GDRs in '96.</title>
<headline>Salomon sold $1 bln Russian MinFins in GDRs in '96.</headline>

<p>Salomon Brothers has sold $1 billion of Russian MinFin bonds via global depositary receipts (GDRs) this year with demand rising since Russia received high speculative ratings for its coming Eurobond, it said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the period since March through the end of last week, we have sold $1 billion face value of MinFins,&quot; Salomon Brothers managing director, Russia and CIS, James Dannis told a news conference.</p>
<p>The total mominal amount of MinFins currently circulating is around $10 billion.</p>
<p>Salomon, with GDR issuer Bank of New York and state-run Russian foreign trade bank Rosvneshtorgbank, which is the main MinFin custodian, launched in March a scheme which allowed U.S. funds to invest in MinFins.</p>
<p>The Bank of New York acts as depositing agent and has a custody account with the Rosvneshtorgbank.</p>
<p>&quot;The key point of our programme is that it allows a new flow of capital which previously could not buy MinFins for legal reasons,&quot; Dannis said and added investors from the U.S., Europe and Asia were among buyers.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 50 percent of these investors represent new money for Russia. Without the programme they would be unable to buy MinFins.&quot;</p>
<p>Dannis said the programme was important because it had brought a vote of confidence from mutual and pension funds which would be buying Russia's forthcoming Eurobond and Eurobonds from Moscow and St Petersburg.</p>
<p>Vladimir Dmitriyev, deputy head of the finance ministry's foreign credit department, told Reuters on Tuesday Russia plans to issue its first Eurobond in November and will soon start a roadshow for it in major financial centres.</p>
<p>Bank of New York senior vice president Kenneth Lopian told the news conference the programme had been much more successful than similar debt GDRs for other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the factors that contributed to the success of these GDRs was that it was the right product, at the right time, with the right team,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dannis and Lopian acknowledged that the problem of frozen bonds was overshadowing the market but said investors were showing willingness to take risks.</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt, the scandal caused some investors to lose some confidence in MinFins... But $1 billion of face value shows investors are ready to take the risk,&quot; Dannis said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the authorities froze $24.22 million of the dollar-denominated bonds, which had gone missing. Banking sources said in late August an order to freeze up to a further $7 million nominal of MinFin bonds was under preparation but it has so far not been approved.</p>
<p>Dannis said Salomon expected investors' interest in MinFins to &quot;grow significantly&quot; ahead of the Eurobond issue.</p>
<p>Salomon had made no specific estimates but demand had risen since Russia received high speculative ratings earlier this month, he said.</p>
<p>Rosvneshorgbank deputy chairman Alexander Osiptsev said the central bank intended to settle the issue of frozen MinFins by creating an open, depersonalised depositary for bearer MinFin bonds in Rosvneshtorgbank, which handles around 2/3 of all MinFins. Other depositary banks were likely to develop similar schemes, he said.</p>
