<title>NETHERLANDS: Pakhoed to raise share capital.</title>
<headline>Pakhoed to raise share capital.</headline>
<dateline>ROTTERDAM 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch tank storage and shipping group Pakhoed NV said on Tuesday it was positioned for profit growth and would raise its capital base by at least 300 million guilders.</p>
<p>In June, the company said it planned to finance its takeover of U.S. chemicals distributor Univar Corp partly through an issue of preference shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the recent acquisition of Univar Corporation and the imminent divestment of the Furness Group, Royal Pakhoed uses the transition year 1996 for bringing strategic focus into its activities and significantly increasing the profit potential in the future,&quot; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;To strengthen its financial basis Pakhoed will increase guarantee capital by at least 300 million guilders,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Pakhoed said it was in talks with ING Barings on a financing package of 300 to 350 million guilders. This would consist of a mix of 150 to 200 million guilders worth of cumulative financing preference shares and 150 million in subordinated loans.  </p>
<p>The terms and conditions of the preference shares will be announced in the second half of November.</p>
<p>&quot;This financing package will raise the solvency ratio from 20 percent to close to 30 percent,&quot; Pakhoed said, adding the proceeds would be used to reduce debt.</p>
<p>It said it aims to achieve growth of earnings per share while maintaining a minimum solvency rate of 25 percent, which should be gradually raised to 35 percent. The solvency rate is the percentage of Pakhoed's guarantee capital, which consists of ordinary shareholders' equity plus preference shares and subordinated loans, compared with the balance sheet total.  </p>
<p>Pakhoed said that 1996, in which it bought Univar and sold port services group Furness, would be a transition year.</p>
<p>It maintained its forecast that net profit from ordinary operations in the second half of this year would clearly exceed the 61.6 million guilders posted in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The sale of Furness to Hollandia Industriele Maatschappij will result in an extraordinary charge of 13 million guilders but Pakhoed said this will be largely offset by a 10 million guilders gain on the recently announced sale of its third party deepwell disposal business in the U.S.  </p>
<p>Pakhoed is also restructuring its Rotterdam storage units. This includes early retirement for about 60 employees but it said it would announce further measures by the end of October.</p>
<p>The cost of all reorganisations, totalling 54 million guilders, was included in the results for the first half of the current year, Pakhoed said.</p>
<p>The full takeover of Univar, in which Pakhoed had owned a 28 percent stake since 1986, made the Dutch group the world's largest distributor of chemical products. Pakhoed paid 521 million guilders for the remaining 72 percent of the shares, 300 million guilders of which consisted of goodwill.  </p>
<p>Pakhoed said it had historically posted annual net profits in the range of 80 million to 125 million guilders. Of these profits, an annual 70 to 110 million could be attributed to its ongoing core activities in the logistics area.</p>
<p>The company expects this segment to grow only moderately in future but said the addition of distribution activities would &quot;significantly increase&quot; its overall profit potential, as was shown by 1995's takeover of Lambert Riviere in France which immediately contributed to profits per share.</p>
<p>&quot;A similar effect is expected from the acquisition of Univar,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Univar's lacklustre performance in recent years was caused by disappointing results in the U.S., which offset significant improvements in the unit's Canadian and European business.</p>
<p>Pakhoed said it expected Univar to return to its historical profit levels in two to three years time and added the first signs were encouraging. Univar raised its 1996 first-half net profit by 27 percent, with the U.S. division posting a 50 percent profit rise.</p>
<p>Pakhoed estimates overall net profit potential of all its distribution activities at an annual 50 to 85 million guilders, after deducting financing costs, with further growth potential.  </p>
<p>&quot;The overall future earnings capacity of Pakhoed as it stands today, therefore, will be in a range of which the low end of 120 million guilders corresponds with the historical peak earnings,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>It added this forecast did not include effects of future projects or further acquisitions in the logistics and distribution areas.</p>
