<headline>Diana says talks end to sell APC unit.</headline>
<dateline>MILWAUKEE, Wis. 1996-09-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Diana Corp said Wednesday that all previous negotiations and agreements with third parties for the possible sale of its APC unit were terminated.</p>
<p>APC distributes meat and seafood.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Diana continues to weigh strategic alternatives and hopes to to have &quot;some definitive results&quot; on a restructuring plan before the end of November.  </p>
<p>&quot;While no decisions have yet been made, the objective of any restructuring would be to make Sattel Communications a 'pure play' by separating it from Diana's other susidiaries,&quot; Richard Fisher, chairman, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Diana owns 95 percent of Sattel, which supplies telecommunications equipment to public switched telephone networks, Internet service providers, local and long distance carriers, systems integrators and interconnect companies.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no assurances that any such transaction will take place, nor can there be any assurances as to the timing or value of any such transaction,&quot; Fisher added.  </p>
<p>Diana added that APC wil be included in its restructuring plan, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Earlier, Diana reported a net loss for the first quarter ended July 20 of $0.27 a share, compared with a loss of $0.10. Fisher said the loss widened due primarily to startup costs incurred by Sattel, a slight loss at its C&amp;L Communications Corp unit and increased losses at APC.</p>
<p>Sales for the quarter rose to $87.2 million from $81.6 milion due primarily to sales of telecommunications equipment by Sattel, installation and service of voice and data networks by Valley Communications, and increased sales at C&amp;L Communications.</p>
