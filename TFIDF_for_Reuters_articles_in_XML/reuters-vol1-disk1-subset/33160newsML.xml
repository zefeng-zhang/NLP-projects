<title>NETHERLANDS: ARA bunkers head down, other areas still rising.</title>
<headline>ARA bunkers head down, other areas still rising.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-04</dateline>

<p>ARA bunker prices fell on Wednesday as the price spiral inspired by the Iraqi crisis unwound, but bunkers in other areas still rose, traders said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam trade was very thin after a quick burst of activity early on Tuesday. Fuel oil 380 CST was talked in a range $108/$110 fob ARA, down around $4 from Tuesday's peak.</p>
<p>&quot;A few people want to get rid of the fuel oil they bought on Tuesday so the prices had to drop,&quot; one trader said. Dealers assessed Wednesday's bunker demand at less than 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were about $1 a tonne weaker, 380 CST at $113/$114. Activity was also slight.</p>
<p>Southern France bunkers dropped by $1, Italian bunkers were steady, but Spanish prices were $1 higher and, further east, in Greece and Egypt, prices were up by around $5 a tonne.</p>
<p>Dealers said bunkers in the eastern Mediterranean were catching up with gains elsewhere.</p>
<p>Durban prices also rose in a market almost devoid of fuel oil as one refiner continued to recommission its crude furnace. Traders said the position would not ease until the last week of September.</p>
