<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Bulletin dented market hopes of a November rate cut, which had been widely factored in, so economists were asked what they saw as the probability of a cut being delivered before the end of November.</p>
<p>The range of forecasts was quite varied, but the median came out just under a 50 percent likelihood of a rate cut in the next month.</p>
<p>Some economists point to the recent soft employment report, the National Australia Bank's subdued business survey and another fall in the Westpac consumer sentiment index, all of which were released after the Bulletin was finalised in early October, as reasons to remain reasonably optimistic on a rate cut.</p>
<p>And as long as this week's quarterly inflation and wages data proves friendly, a November cut is still seen as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some think the RBA will want to see the latest report on enterprise bargaining agreements, which is due out sometime during November, and may even want to see another month of labour force data before it presses ahead with a cut in current 7.0 percent interest rates.</p>
<p>Some also think that policy makers will want to see the third quarter capital expenditure on November 25 and GDP data in December.</p>
<p>So while a few economists have put a lesser chance of a November easing, they see better oddds of a cut occurring in December if the data between now and then is on the soft side.</p>
<p>Another point made by economists was that the RBA Bulletin was the RBA's view, whereas rate decision are made by the Board, which contain representives of many of the very industries feeling the pinch at present.</p>

<p>NEW MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS - (Omitted from table due to space constraints) Median = -0.8 percent, Average = -0.5 percent, range is -4 pct to +4.3 percent, number of respondents = 20.</p>
<p>INFLATION - The moderation in inflation evident through 1996 is expected to continue, with the annual change in the headline consumer price index dropping under the annual change in the underlying rate for the first time since September 1994.</p>
<p>The key underlying rate is expected to fall back under three percent after being above that level for the last four quarters.</p>
<p>Helping keep the CPI and the underlying rate at moderate levels are the effects of the higher Australian dollar, the discounting in the retail sector to clear stock, the weakness in employment, as well as subdued prices in manufacturing.</p>
<p>The impact of the interest rate cuts announced in June, and those following the July 31 rate cut, will be more apparent in the December quarter, economists said.</p>
<p>WAGES - Until the release of the RBA Bulletin last Wednesday, this data was seen as the key to whether or not a rate cut would be delivered in November.</p>
<p>Economists expect average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) to show further moderation in annual terms, and said while a good number may not necessarily mean a near term rate cut was certain, it would still keep it on the agenda.</p>
