<title>FRANCE: French police hold three for Corsica car bomb.</title>

<p>French police detained three people in Corsica on Wednesday in connection with a car bomb that killed a nationalist leader last July, police said.</p>
<p>The arrests were part of a crackdown on separatist guerrillas ordered by Prime Minister Alain Juppe following a new flare-up of separatist violence on the Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>Bombs have exploded on the holiday island every night since the outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) Historic Wing called off a shaky truce three weeks ago.</p>
<p>The latest two rocked a state employment agency and a bar overnight, causing damage but no injuries.</p>
<p>The first explosion late on Tuesday shattered the windows and damaged the employment office in Ile Rousse in the north of the French Mediterranean island. No one claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>Over an hour later, a small bomb damaged the metal shutter of the Le Rallye bar in the island capital Ajaccio in the south. No one claimed responsibility but police found the words &quot;Danger, mine, Arabs Out&quot; scrawled on a wall.</p>
<p>The latest arrests were connected to the car bomb killing of a leader of the movement Cuncolta Naziunalista, the FLNC's legal wing. The attack, in Bastia, was believed to be part of a bloody war between rival separatist groups disagreeing on objectives and tactics.</p>
<p>Paris anti-terrorism magistrates have launched a probe into six suspected members or sympathisers of FLNC following the upsurge in violence. Four were placed in preventive detention and two freed on bail.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe has repeatedly pledged to crack down on Corsican guerrillas pushing for greater autonomy from Paris, but few have been detained.</p>
