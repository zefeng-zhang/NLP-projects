<p>A storm that poured more than a foot-and-a-half (0.5 metre) of rain on parts of New England, left more than 100,000 people without drinking water and washed out roads and bridges on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police said at least one person had been reported missing.</p>
<p>The rain had ended or tapered to showers in the hardest hit areas, but a state of emergency remained in effect for parts of Maine, Massachusetts and all of New Hampshire where the threat of river and coastal flooding remained.</p>
<p>&quot;I did see something in (the town of) Wells that I've never seen in my life, a snow plough clearing seaweed off the roads,&quot; Maine Gov. Angus King told reporters after touring the damage area by helicopter.</p>
<p>King said it was too early to estimate the damage in his state, but a request would be made for federal emergency assistance.</p>
<p>Authorities in New Hampshire kept a close eye on the Saco and Lamprey rivers that were both above flood stage. Rivers in Massachusetts were slowly dropping from rainfall received over the weekend.</p>
<p>Dams also remained a concern in Northern New England. Residents near Highland Lake in Westbrook, Maine, were urged to evacuate Tuesday after water began flowing around the lake's dam.</p>
<p>&quot;A Deluge of Misery&quot; read a banner headline in the Portland Press Herald. Portland received 12.27 inches (29.7 cm) of rain from the storm that began late (on) Sunday -- three times what it normally gets in the entire month of October.</p>
<p>Camp Ellis received 19.19 inches (48.7 cm) rain from the storm, which was &quot;perhaps the greatest storm total since precipitation records have been established for Maine,&quot; the National Weather Service declared.</p>
<p>Rainwater runoff broke the primary supply pipe of the Portland Water District, leaving 140,000 residents of the state's largest city and surrounding communities without drinking water Tuesday.</p>
<p>Travel remained tricky through the region. A 100-foot section of the Maine Turnpike was washed out.</p>
<p>In Boston, portions of the subway system remained closed because of flood damage on Monday to Kenmore Square, an important junction, which remained under water, a day after the storm left the city.</p>
<p>Rescue crews searched for a driver who disappeared on Monday night when his pickup drove into a washed out road in Saco, Maine. The storm, which has battered the northeast since Saturday, has been blamed for four deaths.</p>
<p>Emergency shelters were set up in coastal communities in Maine and New Hampshire, although several in the Portland area had to be moved when the drinking water system failed, authorities said.</p>
<p>Not everyone heeded evacuation calls. &quot;I'd go with the house if it went,&quot; said Harry Ivers, who has lived along Mill Brook in Westbrook, Maine, for 28 years. One of Ivers' neighbours admitted he ignored a roadblock and fell into a washout.</p>
<p>Scores of schools in the region closed for the second day, as flooding made roads impassable. Some schools were being used to shelter people from a dozen different communities driven from their homes by the floods, the Massachusetts Red Cross said.</p>
<p>The rain continued in central and Down East Maine, but the low pressure system that produced the foul weather was weakening as it moved towards the Canadian Maritimes, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
