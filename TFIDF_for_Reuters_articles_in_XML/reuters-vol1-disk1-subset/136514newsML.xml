<p>The Slovak finance ministry on Wednesday said it had approved a request by oil refiner Slovnaft a.s. to increase maximum prices of motor fuels, effective from the beginning of November.</p>
<p>&quot;Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik approved Slovnaft's request to increase maximum prices of motor fuels, effective November 1,&quot; ministry spokeswoman Zuzana Brutenicova told Reuters without further elaboration.</p>
<p>Slovnaft Director Slavomir Hatina told a news conference on Wednesday that the company proposal was for increases of about five percent in petrols and about eight percent in diesel oil.</p>
<p>&quot;In our request to finance ministry, we have proposed an increase of 0.5 crowns in petrol prices, and of 1.4 crowns in prices of diesel oil,&quot; Hatina said.</p>
<p>Oil prices are among those still regulated by the state and any changes must be approved by the finance ministry.</p>
<p>The increase is the fifth this year, following hikes in motor fuel prices in February, May, August and October.</p>
<p>Hatina said the request was based only on a rapid growth in world prices of crude oil over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Slovnaft currently exports about 50 percent of its production and motor fuels account for about 63 percent of its overall refining capacity.</p>
<p>Hatina said the average world prices of all kinds of crude oil in the first nine months of 1996 were about 50 percent higher than the last year's average level.</p>
<p>Slovakia currently imports all its crude oil from Russia, through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline running via Ukraine.</p>
<p>Slovnaft said it had processed about 3.8 million tonnes of crude oil in the January-September period of 1996 and expected to process about five million tonnes (roughly 100,000 barrels per day) this year.</p>
<p>Hatina said though Slovnaft was purchasing Russian oil received at a &quot;favourable discount&quot;, its price had also risen recently as it was tied to the price of North Sea Brent crude on world markets.</p>
<p>Hatina said Slovnaft had several times demanded that part of Russian oil supplies be delivered as repayment of the huge Russian debt to Slovakia, inherited from the period before the fall of communism in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;But all this requests have so far been unanswered by the Russian side,&quot; Hatina said. -- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom +42 7 563 3687</p>
