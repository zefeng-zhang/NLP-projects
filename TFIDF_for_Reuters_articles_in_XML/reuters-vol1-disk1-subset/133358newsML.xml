<title>ARGENTINA: Journalists tell of 24 hours in Taleban &quot;hell&quot;.</title>
<headline>Journalists tell of 24 hours in Taleban &quot;hell&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>Two Argentine television journalists came home from Afghanistan on Tuesday with tales of 24 hours of &quot;hell&quot; at the hands of Taleban fundamentalists holding Kabul, who took them for spies and beat them.</p>
<p>Correspondent Natalio Aides and cameraman Walter Moor were detained by the Islamic radical group last week but released after a day thanks to U.N. mediation.</p>
<p>Aides told reporters on arrival in Buenos Aires that their troubles began when they tried to interview two Afghan women in Kabul. The city was captured by the Taleban last month and has since been subjected to harsh Islamic Sharia law.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone reported us, because speaking to women is a mortal sin in Kabul. They told us the Talebans were coming. There were about 25 of them, they gave us a terrible beating and then began the hell of 24 hours' detention,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two Argentine journalists and their local intepreter and driver were held incommunicado by the Talebans, beaten with rifle butts and robbed of their equipment and papers.</p>
<p>&quot;They were absolutely convinced we were working as spies and selling information to the former Interior Minister of the deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani,&quot; said Aides. &quot;We could not make them understand that was not the case.&quot;</p>
<p>The pair were eventually released after pleas from United Nations officials on the urging of Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Fernando Petrella and their television channel, Telefe. Their local interpreter and driver are both still in detention.</p>
<p>Aides called his captors &quot;callous, illiterate outlaws whose law is blood and fire and killing for killing's sake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they hanged their president (former Soviet-backed leader Najibullah, toppled in 1992 and killed by the Taleban on entering Kabul) in a public square, imagine what could have happened to us. We were in the hands of Allah,&quot; he said.</p>
