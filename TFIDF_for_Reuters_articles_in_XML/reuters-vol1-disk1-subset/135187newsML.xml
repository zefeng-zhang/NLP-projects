<p>Tokyo naphtha prices drifted lower on Tuesday in a quiet market almost devoid of firm buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Naphtha buyers backed away, expecting the market to take a bearish turn in response to crude losses in Tokyo business hours,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Offers for second-half December open-spec naphtha were heard at $222.50, with bids nominally assessed at $221.00. It was sold twice at $222.50 on Monday.</p>
<p>First-half January was quoted at $220.00/$221.50, down from late Monday's $221.75/$222.75.  </p>
<p>Low-sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) traders were waiting for Pertamina's initial allocation for November lifting. It is expected to allocate about 3.5 million barrels for November, some traders said. The Indonesian firm will announce its November allotment later this week, they said.</p>
<p>Saudi Aramco and its naphtha customers will start 1997 term talks later today in London, traders said. Out of about a dozen potential buyers gathered in London, three trading houses and one refiner from Japan as well as one South Korean trading firm are scheduled to negotiate with Aramco on Tuesday, traders said. -- Tokyo Commodities (81-3 3432-8837)</p>
