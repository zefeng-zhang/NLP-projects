<p>Some traders believe the European Union (EU) will award up to 100,000 tonnes of current series white sugar at its weekly tender on Wednesday but others expect the tonnage to be sharply down as doubts linger over the rebate calculation.</p>
<p>Traders said there was market disagreement over which Matif futures contract would be used for the weekly restitution, with December producing a large tonnage and October a lower one.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it'll be a large one, minimum 60,000 tonnes and possibly as much as 100,000,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Commission is taking December into account I think people will actually start to get the licences they need and they are going to need them for October shipment onwards.&quot;</p>
<p>But another trader disagreed, saying the spot October contract was likely to be used although a combination of both contracts was also possible.</p>
<p>On the basis of October, the maximum tonnage award might only be 25,000 tonnes, compared with last week's 16,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got one more tender against the October and then the interest will be in the December -- I think a lot of traders are probably going to wait until October disappears,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are any doubts at all, then people are likely to hold off anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>The maximum restitution for licences was estimated at 43.457 Ecus (European Currency Units) per 100 kg of sugar using the December contract and 43.180 Ecus on October, traders said.</p>
<p>The EU awarded 43.521 Ecus last week with traders in France receiving the total allotment.</p>
