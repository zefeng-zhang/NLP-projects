<p>Shell Canada Ltd on Tuesday became the second integrated Canadian oil company to report lower third-quarter earnings, citing intense competition in gasoline sales and eroding margins in chemicals.</p>
<p>Shell Canada, 78 percent-owned by Royal Dutch Shell Group, said third-quarter earnings fell to C$73 million or C$0.65 a share from C$98 million or C$0.87 per share in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Revenues increased to C$1.36 billion from C$1.24 billion in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Suncor last week also reported lower earnings.  </p>
<p>Although Shell Canada's fortunes improved in its upstream oil and gas operations thanks to stronger oil and gas prices and higher volumes, downstream results were hit during the period, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very pleased with the improvement in our resources earnings,&quot; Shell Canada president and chief executive Chuck Wilson said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;However, Oil Products faces a very difficult business environment and we are continuing to examine alternatives to improve on our profitiability.&quot;  </p>
<p>During the period, Shell Canada's oil products division earned C$19 million, a dramatic drop from the C$73 million earned in the year earlier period.</p>
<p>Canada's integrateds have been hit with higher refinery feedstock costs because of this year's runup in crude oil prices, as well as a crippling series of gasoline price wars in the huge Quebec market.</p>
<p>Shell Canada spokeswoman Jan Rowley said the company would continue to improve its downstream results by bolstering refinery reliability, cutting costs and upgrading its service station network.  </p>
<p>However, moves being examined do not include sales of any operations or strategic alliances with other retailers, as has been the trend in the United States and Europe, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It continues along the lines of working on those elements of our business that our within our control,&quot; Rowley said.</p>
<p>Chemical earnings were also lower at C$6 million in the quarter, down from C$11 million in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>The company announced earlier this month it would sell its chemical division to a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell for C$635 million. It said it expected a C$200 million after-tax gain on the sale.  </p>
<p>Lower styrene prices have pressured the division's profitability.</p>
<p>Earnings at Shell Canada's Resources division climbed to C$182 million in the third quarter from C$128 million last year.</p>
<p>The improvement came as a result of higher oil and gas prices and production volumes, as well as a gain on the sale of its Harmattan Elkton properties in Alberta, Shell Canada said.</p>
<p>Natural gas production increased 703 million cubic feet per day from 635 million in the third quarter of 1995. Crude oil, gas liquids and bitumen output averaged 86,390 barrels per day, up from 75,470 barrels per day last year, the company said. -- Reuters Calgary Bureau 403 531-1624</p>
