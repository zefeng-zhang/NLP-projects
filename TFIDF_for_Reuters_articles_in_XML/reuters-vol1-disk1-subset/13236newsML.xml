<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman is considering inviting Yasser Arafat to meet him after receiving a letter from the Palestinian leader on advancing the peace process, a spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Aryeh Shumer, director of the president's office, denied a report in Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private residence this coming week over the objections of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>But Shumer told Army Radio: &quot;When a letter arrives from the head of the Palestinian Authority to the president of the state of Israel expressing his hopes and wishes for peace, it is only right that he talks about this with the president.&quot;</p>
<p>Shumer said Weizman would consult with Netanyahu. Israel Radio reported that Weizman and Netanyahu would meet later on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The president has no intention to hold any meeting (with Arafat) without full coordination with the prime minister,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who opposes the principle of exchanging occupied land for peace -- the bedrock of the former Labour government's peace deals with the Palestinians -- has said he has no desire to meet Arafat.</p>
<p>But Netanyahu has pledged his right-wing government would renew peace talks with the PLO.</p>
<p>The Palestinian minister who will lead a PLO negotiating team said on Saturday Israel had informed Arafat it wanted to begin the talks before September 2.</p>
<p>On Thursday Netanyahu, elected on May 29, telephoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to tell him that peace talks with the PLO last held before the Israeli poll would resume &quot;in the very near future&quot;.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was apparently shaken by Mubarak's suggestion earlier on Thursday that he might cancel a Middle East economic summit in November over Israel's stalling peace moves.</p>
<p>Palestinians are still awaiting an Israeli announcement of a date for a long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>The PLO regards the redeployment, to which Israel's previous government committed itself in an accord signed with the PLO last September, as a test of Netanyahu's peace intentions.</p>
<p>Yedioth Ahronoth said Weizman scheduled a meeting with Arafat at his private resident in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after the Palestinian leader sent him an emotional appeal &quot;to save the peace process&quot;.</p>
<p>A PLO official told Reuters that Arafat had yet to receive a response from Weizman.</p>
<p>&quot;Yasser Arafat wrote a letter to (U.S. President Bill) Clinton and also wrote one to the president of Israel...The president reported immediately to the prime minister and they decided to meet and decide,&quot; Shumer told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Shumer denied Yedioth Ahronoth's report that Weizman had issued an ultimatum to Netanyahu to meet Arafat himself within 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Weizman) did not say 'If you don't meet him, I will',&quot; Shumer said.</p>
<p>The office of Israeli president is largely ceremonial. But Weizman, a former defence minister and an architect of Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, has spoken out frequently on the peace process with the Palestinians -- at times urging the former Labour government to slow it down.</p>
<p>Asked about Weizman's current position, Shumer said: &quot;The president wants the peace process to continue.&quot;</p>
