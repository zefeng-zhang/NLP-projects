<title>UK: Oversupply hits North Sea crude premiums.</title>

<text>
<p>North Sea crude oil premiums fell sharply on Tuesday afternoon on oversupply of prompt cargoes and a dearth of refiner buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>December Brent paper slipped 36 cents to $24.28 per barrel by 1530 GMT and the Nov/Dec spread eased by eight cents to +40 cents. Dated Brent fell nearer to parity with November paper, after a Nov 10-12 cargo traded at just two cents premium on Tuesday. Tuesday's Brent date was kept by Esso ahead of the five o'clock deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;The arbitrage to the U.S. is closed, the margins are OK, but there is a buyers' strike,&quot; a trader at a major oil company said. &quot;With low stocks the market is always going to be volatile.&quot;  </p>
<p>Statfjord, having traded on Monday at Dated Brent +60 cents, was offered at +45 cents for loading on Nov 4-6.</p>
<p>Forties, which fetched +54 cents on Friday, was offered at +35 cents for 10-12 loading.</p>
<p>Oseberg, worth Dated +38 cents on Monday, was offered aggressively and several cargoes loading around the end of October were still available.</p>
<p>Bids for all these grades were well below sellers' ideas, traders said.</p>
<p>Urals in the Mediterranean held around dated -60/-55 cents with 2-3 large cargoes for sale. Planned pipeline maintenance of 3-4 days at Novorossiisk was thought by some to have started on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nigeria's Qua Iboe was under some pressure with a cargo loading today heard still unsold but overall West African light crudes were balanced in a market where most refiners were already covered for the first half of November.</p>
<p>Syrian negotiations continued with best offer at dated Brent -5 cents fob Syria while lifters held off 15 cents lower. &quot;The negotiations are very tough,' one lifter said.</p>
