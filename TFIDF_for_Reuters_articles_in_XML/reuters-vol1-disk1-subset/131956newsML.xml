<headline>Indonesia says not involved in US political funds.</headline>

<p>Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Monday his government was not involved in funds given to the U.S. Democratic Party by people with links to an Indonesian business house.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an attack, this is a campaign against Indonesia that is totally unsubstantiated,&quot; Alatas told reporters. &quot;Indonesia is not involved, has never been involved. We will not get involved in that kind of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>James Riady, deputy chairman of Indonesia's Lippo group and a member of one of the country's wealthiest families, has been caught up in the U.S. election campaign through his friendship with President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>The two met when Riady was a resident of Arkansas and Clinton was state governor.</p>
<p>Republicans waging an uphill battle for the presidency have questioned donations to Clinton's Democratic Party from people connected to the Lippo group, suggesting the aim was to influence U.S. government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a private affair of Mr James Riady and the Democratic National Committee,&quot; Alatas said. &quot;Is it good or bad...we don't know. I am not making a value judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are reports saying it is the Indonesia connection and not the Riady connection. I reject that. The government of Indonesia has nothing to do with it,&quot; Alatas said.</p>
<p>The Lippo group, with interests ranging from banking, insurance and securities to property, trading and health care, has interests and offices in several Asian countries, Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times newspaper said in an investigative report that Riady, his family and executives of their companies had contributed $475,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates since 1991.</p>
<p>The White House has denied any impropriety and Riady has not commented on the reports.</p>
