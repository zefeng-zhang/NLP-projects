<p>Sri Lanka's separatist Tamil guerrillas attacked a remote northeastern police post on Tuesday, killing 13 policemen and three civilian home guards and wounding six more, a Defence Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>The attack came a day after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels ambushed an army route-clearing patrol in the eastern province, killing six soldiers and wounding two, he said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's attack took place shortly after daybreak near the village of Palliyagodella in the Polonnaruwa district, 175 km (108 miles) northeast of the capital Colombo, he added.</p>
<p>No more details of the attack were immediately available.</p>
<p>Reinforcements which rushed to the scene from nearby police posts fought the rebels. &quot;Police confirmed that terrorists have suffered heavy casualties,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The LTTE was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>On Monday, the rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the Indian Ocean island's north and east, ambushed an army patrol at Mavadiwembu, about 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Tuesday's battle.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the ethnic war, now in its 14th year.</p>
