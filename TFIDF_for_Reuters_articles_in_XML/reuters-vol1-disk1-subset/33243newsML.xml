<p>French public sector lender Credit Local de France reported on Tuesday a six percent rise in half year profit ahead of its alliance with one of Belgium's largest banks.</p>
<p>The bank said net attributable profit for the six months to the end of June rose to 793 million francs ($156 million) from 748 million and forecast its ninth straight increase in full-year profit.</p>
<p>&quot;On the eve of of our alliance with Credit Communal de Belgique (CCB), Credit Local de France is displaying its strength,&quot; bank chairman Pierre Richard said in a statement.</p>
<p>The alliance, in which the two banks will take cross-holdings in each other's share capital, comes into effect at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The partnership will create the 22nd largest bank in Europe and the largest European financial institution specialising in loans to local and regional public authorities.</p>
<p>Shares climbed 8.80 francs or 2.13 percent to 421.80 francs by mid-day on the announcement, outperforming the blue-chip CAC-40 index which was up just 0.65 percent.</p>
<p>Net banking income jumped nearly 23 pecent to 1.81 billion francs while net provisions totalled 87 million francs. That figure included 97 million francs worth of provisions for real estate compared with 136 million in the previous half-year period and a nine million franc recovery from provisions.</p>
<p>Richard called the financial results &quot;very satisfactory&quot; and said its commercial activities had been sustained during the first eight months of the year, especially internationally where growth had been strong.</p>
<p>Operating costs rose 15.7 percent mainly due to intergration of four new units, including CLF-Hypothekenbank Berlin and CLF-Suede. Corporate taxes rose 34 percent due to the jump in operating profit and consolidation of companies paying tax.</p>
<p>The bank had said last July it would pay a total exceptional dividend of 626 million francs to shareholders before the alliance went into effect. The payout is aimed at redressing the difference in size between the two banks.</p>
<p>It said on Wednesday the exceptional dividend would work out to a gross payment of 25.50 francs per share or 17 francs net to shareholders before the alliance with CCB. That was on top of a 20.85 franc gross dividend paid in June 1996.</p>
<p>Richard said the strength of the new group which would boast combined total asseets of 1,000 billion francs, &quot;will permit us to develop even more actively in Europe and soon throughout the world&quot;. ($ = 5.084 French Francs)</p>
