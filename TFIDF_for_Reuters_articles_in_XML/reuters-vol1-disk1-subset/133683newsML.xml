<headline>Stocks weighed down by profit-taking in high techs.</headline>

<p>Stock prices fell Tuesday as the market took its direction from the weakness in technology shares after Digital Equipment Corp. reported a bigger-than-expected loss.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 33.17 points at 6,057.70, extending its retreat after setting four record high closes last week.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 13-8 on active volume of 232 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index, a barometer of high-tech stocks, was off 18.15 points at 1,218.26. The American Stock Exchange index was off 2.03 at 574.84.</p>
<p>The selling was encouraged by a worse-than-expected loss by Digital, but analysts also said that technology stocks have had strong moves recently and were overextended.</p>
<p>&quot;The high techs are getting a much needed near term correction,&quot; said Roy Blumberg, chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been the leaders of the move higher over the last couple of months,&quot; he said. &quot;They've had a tremendous run and, as long as the market holds up well, they will have a correction of some 5 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Blumberg said, however, that were the market to embark on a more significant downward move, technology stocks would find themselves vulnerable in the ensuing sell-off.</p>
<p>&quot;Not that there is anything wrong with their fundamentals, but when people like stocks they take them too high,&quot; Blumberg said. &quot;The techs were taken to levels at which too much is discounted.&quot;</p>
<p>Digital Equipment posted a deeper-than-expected loss of $65.9 million for the last three months compared with a profit of $48.2 million a year ago. The company's stock was down 5 at 29-3/8.</p>
<p>Other high techs followed suit, with Microsoft off 2 at 132, Intel down 2-1/2 at 105-1/4, Iomega Corp. down 1-1/2 at 21-3/4 and Micron Technology down 1-1/8 at 29-1/2.</p>
<p>&quot;The market continues to consolidate last week's gains and the Nasdaq and the tech sector could continue to see considerable profit-taking,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.</p>
<p>In other earnings-related news, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 1-3/8 at 105-1/2 after the company reported higher-than-expected third quarter earnings. Eli Lilly, another drug maker, rose 1-1/4 to 70 on strong earnings.</p>
