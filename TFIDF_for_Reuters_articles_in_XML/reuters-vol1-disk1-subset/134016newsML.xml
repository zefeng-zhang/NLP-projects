<p>The European Parliament called on Tuesday for savings it made in the 1997 EU budget to be used for trans-European transport networks (TENS), the Northern Ireland peace programme and research projects.</p>
<p>The 626-member parliament, often derided as a talking shop, has the power to throw out the European Union budget and has twice done so in 1979 and 1984.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to redistribute savings of 300 million European currency units ($375 million) for the three priority areas,&quot; German Social Democrat Detlev Samland, head of the parliament's budgetary committee, told Reuters during a break in a first reading of the 1997 budget proposal.</p>
<p>The parliament is due to vote on Thursday on the executive European Commission's proposal for an 88-billion-Ecu budget, before a second and final reading in December.</p>
<p>EU leaders agreed three years ago to build trans-European networks -- 14 huge road and rail projects -- in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth.</p>
<p>But their finance ministers, worried about meeting the strict criteria for joining European monetary union (EMU) in 1999, last week rejected proposed new funding of one billion Ecus to get the projects up and running.</p>
<p>EU Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen said he greatly appreciated the parliament's support in trying to push through priority job-creating road, rail and research projects.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret the Council was not able to follow our proposal,&quot; he said, stressing that EMU and employment were compatible.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Irish EU Presidency, Hugh Coveney, said that budgetary difficulties in member states made it very difficult for them to consider increasing EU spending.</p>
<p>&quot;While it is not possible...for the Council to reach agreement...on a revision of the financial perspective (budgetary limit) for 1998 and 1999, ministers have noted funding (is) available from the EIB (European Investment Bank) and existing budgetary resources.&quot;</p>
<p>Laurens Brinkhorst, who is responsible for putting the budget through parliament, said during the debate that all political parties agreed on the need for a tight budget to meet the Maastricht Treaty EMU criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a symbolic value that Europe should not be seen as a spender when national parliaments want to be parsimonious,&quot; said Brinkhorst, a Dutch member of the liberal group.</p>
<p>The parliament would keep within the Commission's spending proposal, he stressed.</p>
<p>But Pauline Green, leader of the Socialist Euro MPs, the parliament's largest political group, called for a 500-million-Ecu increase in the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We were promised new money and it has not been forthcoming,&quot; Green told a news conference.</p>
