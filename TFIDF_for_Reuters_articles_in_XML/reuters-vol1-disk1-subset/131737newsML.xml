<p>Major industrial companies such as Norsk Hydro and Kvaerner fell on Monday to help depress the Norwegian stock exchange, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Oslo Total index dropped 0.51 percent to 878.56 points in healthy trade worth 740 million crowns, including 194 million crowns in Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest listed company.</p>
<p>Hydro slipped initially when the bourse opened after the industrial giant announced it's third-quarter result was down 45 percent because of lower prices for aluminium and petrochemicals. But the share recovered some lost ground to close 0.3 percent lower at 305 crowns.</p>
<p>The third-quarter announcement had been preceded by selling of Hydro shares last week.</p>
<p>Food-based conglomerate Orkla A shares were down 1.6 percent at 408.50 crowns in what a dealer attributed to profit-taking.</p>
<p>Kvaerner B shares fell 2.3 percent to 210 crowns to continue a downward spin from last Friday when shipping group Storli said it had cancelled an order for two chemical carriers from Kvaerner's Floroe yard.</p>
