<text>
<p>Mexico overnight Cetes rates closed at 28.25 percent on Tuesday, or 10 basis points below Monday's inflated closing rate, but trended upwards throughout the session due to expectations of primary interest rate rises, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;They tried to jack up rates, probably in order to boost primary rates, but the overnight rate did not change much during the session,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The overnight rate had opened at 27.80 percent.  </p>
<p>A Reuters survey of 11 money market traders showed they expected bellwether 28-day Cetes rates to rise by an average of 169 basis points to 27.59 percent at Tuesday evening's primary auction.</p>
<p>The traders meanwhile expected rates on 91-day Cetes to rise 11 basis points on average to 28.75 percent and to fall 48 basis points to 29.05 percent.</p>
<p>In the term market, 28-day Cetes closed at 28 percent, while 91-day and 182-day issues both closed at 28.50 percent. Banco de Mexico injected a more-than-average 6.058 billion pesos in the secondary market by auctioning four credit lines, which it assigned at between 30.39 and 30.53 percent.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed up 80 basis points at 30.40 percent.</p>
<p>Total credit maturities for Wednesday were estimated at 6.027 billion pesos.</p>
