<p>Avery Dennison Corp plans to report record third-quarter profit and sales as well as recommend a stock split and dividend increase on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the labeling company's chief financial officer, Gregory Jenkins, said in an interview that Avery will report a net income for the quarter totalling $46.6 million or $0.89 per share.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the company's quarterly operating profit was 7.5 percent higher than analyst expectations.</p>
<p>Operating profit totalled $0.86 per share against analyst estimates of $0.80 when excluding a one-time gain of $0.03 a share from the sale of a joint venture interest in Japan, he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the company's net income was 30 percent higher than the $35.8 million or $0.67 per share reported for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Profit before interest, taxes and one-time gains reached 9.7 percent in the latest quarter or a full percentage point higher than a year earlier, it said.</p>
<p>Avery's sales for the quarter were $819.3 million, 5.0 percent more than last year's $783.5 million, it added.</p>
<p>The newspaper cited Jenkins as saying the healthy quarterly results were due to the strongest operating margins in nearly 10 years.</p>
<p>&quot;The restructuring work that we have been doing for four years now is finally cutting in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said the company planned to recommend a stock split and an effective dividend increase to the company's board of directors, which is to meet on Thursday.</p>
<p>Avery made a two-for-one split in March 1987, it said, adding that its current quarterly dividend was $0.30 a share.</p>
