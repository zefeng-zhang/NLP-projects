<p>The European Commission called on Wednesday for negotiations on a new European Union treaty to be speeded up, saying the progress in the talks was too slow.</p>
<p>Chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said Commission President Jacques Santer had expressed concern at the EU executive's weekly meeting about the pace of the negotiations, formally called the inter-governmental conference (IGC).</p>
<p>He said the Commission would hold a special meeting to discuss ways of giving momentum to the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission is a little uneasy about the progress that is being made, or not being made,&quot; van der Pas told a news briefing.</p>
<p>The talks, which began in March, are designed to prepare the EU for an influx of new members from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>To date, negotiators have mainly offered wish-lists from their national capitals, avoiding the hard bargaining that will be needed to bring the talks to fruition some time in the middle of next year.</p>
<p>While a number of countries see this as normal at this stage of the debate, others, notably France, want the IGC wrapped up as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Paris wants to avoid having a drawn-out treaty ratification process run into its next election campaign.</p>
<p>EU leaders have called for a special summit in Ireland in October to discuss the IGC's progress, but have been unable to find a date that is convenient to leaders from all 15 countries.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers are to disuss the issue at a meeting in Tralee, Ireland, at the weekend.</p>
<p>Van der Pas said an example of the IGC's lack of movement was the fact that nothing had been agreed about incorporating trade in services into current EU treaty language about trade.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears this isn't progressing every well,&quot; he said.</p>
