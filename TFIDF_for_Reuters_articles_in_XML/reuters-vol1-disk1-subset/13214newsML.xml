<p>Indonesian kidnappers holding 12 forestry workers in remote Irian Jaya province are rebels following orders, the official Antara news agency said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Antara quoted the head of the local military district Colonel Frans de Wanna as saying documents were found in a bag of one kidnapper killed last week by soldiers which showed he had been given task of robbing the workers.</p>
<p>&quot;We can make the confirmation based on documents in a bag carried by one of the abuductors who was killed in clash with troops,&quot; de Wanna was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The 12 workers from forest concessionaire PT Kamundan Raya, a subsidiary of the privately-owned agribusiness Djajanti Group, were part of a larger group kidnapped on August 14.</p>
<p>They were taken after a raid by a group of lightly armed Irianese on their base camp 60 km (35 miles) east of the mining town of Timika, 4,000 km (2,500 miles) east of Jakarta.</p>
<p>While a number of hostages have escaped or been released, the report said the military had not yet managed to free any captives.</p>
<p>De Wanna said the captured documents showed that the dead man, identified as Tius Orop Yane Magae Yogi, aged in his 30s, was the leader of a &quot;security disturbing group&quot; (GPK).</p>
<p>The military in Irian Jaya uses the term GPK to describe the Free Papua Movement (OPM) whose lightly armed bands of rebels have roamed the countryside in their campaign against Indonesian rule in the former Dutch colony since 1963.</p>
<p>The military had earlier played down the links between the hostage takers and any political movement.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the OPM held 11 people, including five Europeans, in captivity for more than four months in what it said was an act aimed at publicising its fight for a free Irian Jaya.</p>
<p>In May, four British, two Dutch and three Indonesian hostages held by the OPM escaped after an army operation for their rescue was launched. Two Indonesian hostages were killed by their captors.</p>
