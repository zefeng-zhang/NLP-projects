<headline>IPE Brent closes higher on refinery outage.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-22</dateline>

<p>IPE Brent crude staged a strong recovery to end in positive territory after a Venezuelan refinery problem reversed early losses, brokers said.</p>
<p>December Brent closed at $24.63 per barrel, two cents above Monday's settlement, having touched a low of $24.17.</p>
<p>&quot;The refinery news was the main thing that brought prices back up,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Technical problems with a 108,000 barrel per day catalytic cracker at Venezuela's Amuay refinery caused an unscheduled shutdown, but a spokesman said international sales would not be affected.  </p>
<p>An Amuay spokesman said the problem would be fixed by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Earlier, Brent prices had fallen after Colonial pipeline reported a surge in shipping orders for sending heating oil from the Gulf coast to the Northeast.</p>
<p>A Colonial spokeman said a gasoline pipeline would be used for heating oil deliveries. But this prompted a rally in gasoline prices, which partially offset the weaker crude and heating oil.</p>
<p>However, Nov IPE gas oil failed to catch all of the late rally, closing $3.50 lower at $230.75 per tonne.  </p>
<p>Traders were waiting for the weekly stock data from the American Petroleum Institute after the close which are expected to show a one million barrel build in distillate stocks, according to a survey by Reuters. Crude stocks were expected to build by 200,000 barrels and gasoline was expected to fall by one million barrels.</p>
