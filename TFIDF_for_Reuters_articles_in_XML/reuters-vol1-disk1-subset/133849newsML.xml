<title>USA: Dollar sinks on late profit-taking.</title>
<headline>Dollar sinks on late profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar ended lower against major currencies Tuesday as a late afternoon nosedive wiped out modest early gains.</p>
<p>Investors sold the dollar and British pound against the mark to lock in profits after several days of rallying, while a wire service report triggered dollar sales for yen, currency dealers said.</p>
<p>Market News Service reported that an unidentified White House official predicted the persistent trade gap between the United States and Japan would soon begin to widen after months of shrinkage.</p>
<p>When U.S. imports from Japan exceed exports to Japan, Japanese firms are left with a steady supply of extra dollars that must be sold in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>&quot;That story is probably what got the ball rolling,&quot; said James Phoenix, director of foreign exchange sales at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York.</p>
<p>For most of the session the dollar had hovered just below Tuesday's 33-month high at 112.91 yen. But the late selloff left the dollar at 112.27 yen, down from 112.72 late Monday.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar fell nearly a pfennig to 1.5248 from 1.5343 late Monday. The dollar also fell to 1.2535 Swiss francs from 1.2630. The British pound ended higher at $1.5982 from $1.5926. The dollar fell to Canadian $1.3449 from C$1.3466.</p>
<p>Investors sold sterling when it failed to top key technical levels at 2.45 marks, a 22-month high, and $1.60. The mark and Swiss franc powered higher against the dollar as a result, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some pretty aggressive dollar selling by investment banks. Some people had (bought) the dollar in the morning, but when there was no follow-through buying, they got nervous,&quot; said Stephen Jury, chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed against the yen in early trading after Japan reported its index of leading economic indicators plunged to 33.3 in August from 77.8 in July -- well below the 50.0 level deemed the boundary between boom and bust.</p>
<p>That suggests the Bank of Japan will keep interest rates low in coming months, which would bolster the dollar by enhancing the relative value of assets priced in dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japanese economy is still struggling. The dollar should continue to move gradually higher against the yen over the next month or so,&quot; said Tadatoshi Taso, chief dealer at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.</p>
<p>The mark also got an early boost as Germany kicked off a campaign to sell its state-owned telephone company, Deutsche Telekom.</p>
<p>The proposed sale would raise about 18 billion marks and investors speculated the mark would rise as a result of the temporary increase in demand for the German unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's move was very much a move of the mark against sterling and the yen. That also touched off some sales of dollars for marks,&quot; said Chris Adair, currency trader at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.</p>
