<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it is looking into an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale from a post office box in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Police departments and FBI offices around the country have received numerous reports relating to the e-mail message,&quot; the bureau said in a statement. &quot;The message is a hoax and the matter is being investigated.&quot;</p>
<p>The messages appeared to come from two accounts at America Online Inc, R9ch and TipToe0001, and recipients around the world deluged the online service with complaints, the FBI said.</p>
<p>America Online responded with a message stating that the accounts had been disconnected on Monday morning and the service's legal department was investigating.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, the service discovered that the users at the two addresses were not involved in sending the messages.</p>
<p>&quot;We have determined that they were not the actual senders,&quot; said William Burrington, director of law and public policy. &quot;We're not sure yet how those AOL addresses were able to be used to send this material but we're confident that the subscribers were not the ones.&quot;</p>
<p>Burrington said the company's own computers containing subscriber data were not breached. AOL is cooperating with law enforcement agencies, he said. &quot;We still have our zero tolerance policy for child pornography.&quot;</p>
<p>Hackers have in the past established bogus America Online accounts using stolen credit card numbers and the signup disks the service widely distributes by mail and in magazines.</p>
<p>The e-mail message offered pictures, video and audio tapes, posters and games based on child pornography for sale with an address in the Jackson Heights section of New York City.</p>
