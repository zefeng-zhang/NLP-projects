<p>The fate of &quot;heirless&quot; Jewish artworks seized by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during World War Two will be laid to rest next week when thousands of artefacts go under the hammer in Vienna.</p>
<p>British auction house Christie's is to handle the sale of more than 8,000 items, including paintings by old masters, ancient busts, and tapestries, valued at some $3.5 million. Proceeds will go to victims of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The auction, to be held at the Vienna Museum of Applied Arts, ends years of controversy over Austria's delay in returning the works to their owners after the Allies handed them back to their countries of origin at the end of the war.</p>
<p>&quot;Austria has the possibility to free itself from this moral burden and set things right as well as can be after 50 years,&quot; said Paul Grosz, president of Vienna's Jewish community.</p>
<p>The original owners of the items, or their heirs, can still apply to recover their possessions before the auction on October 29 and 30. But most died in the Holocaust or fled into exile during the war, according to Grosz.</p>
<p>Much of the material was stored for the past 40 years in a monastery in Mauerbach, Austria, as the government never managed to trace the owners.</p>
<p>&quot;The government simply did not take the initiative to do any more than had already been done and the situation fell into immobility. Any initiatives to publicise the issue always came from abroad,&quot; Grosz said.</p>
<p>It was only last year that Austria finally handed over the works to the Federation of Austrian Jewish Communities after a vote in parliament.</p>
<p>Edgar Bronfman, chairman of the honorary committee set up to support the Mauerbach benefit sale of the artworks called it &quot;an injustice long overdue&quot;.</p>
<p>The collection includes a painting by Breughel, a bust of Alexander the Great from 3BC, Albanian guns, Flemish tapestries, Persian carpets and many watercolours of landscapes and society portraits from the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>For most of the post-war era Austria sought to present itself as the first victim of Hitler's aggression.</p>
<p>The position only changed in 1993 when Chancellor Franz Vranitzky acknowleded during a visit to Israel that Austrians were not only victims but also &quot;willing servants of Nazism&quot;.</p>
<p>Last year the Austrian parliament in a ground-breaking move voted to pay out compensation to an estimated 30,000 victims persecuted during Hitler's Nazi rule.</p>
<p>&quot;It can only be a very small attempt to redress a grievance but it's a step in the right direction. It may set a precedent for other items to be found and disposed of in this way,&quot; said Anke Adler Slottke, director of the sale at Christie's.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Swiss banks have come under renewed international pressure to release details of deposits believed to belong to Jews who were murdered by the Nazis.</p>
