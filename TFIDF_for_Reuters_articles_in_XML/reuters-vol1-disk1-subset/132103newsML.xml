<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel arrived in Beijing on Monday for a long-delayed visit to put bilateral ties back on track after a row over Tibet.</p>
<p>Kinkel had originally been scheduled to visit China earlier this year but the plans were postponed due to friction over Beijing's policies towards Tibet.  </p>
<p>Kinkel would meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen later on Monday, said a spokesman for the German embassy in Beijing.</p>
<p>During his five-day visit, Kinkel would also meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng and inaugurate a new German embassy building.</p>
<p>Kinkel had originally planed to visit China in July but Beijing withdrew its invitation after the German lower house of parliament passed a resolution accusing China of trying to eradicate Tibet's cultural identity.</p>
<p>After talks on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly meeting in New York in September, Kinkel and Qian said they had cleared up outstanding problems between China and its biggest European trade partner. Kinkel's invitation was then renewed.</p>
