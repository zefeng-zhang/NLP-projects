<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday the government was sticking to its forecast for unemployment in the year to June 1997 and that the government's decision to set up a Cabinet employment committee was not a concession that the jobs situation was worsening.</p>
<p>&quot;We actually forecast that unemployment would fall over the current year and by the year's end be about 8.25 percent,&quot; Costello told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We think there are very good growth prospects and we stand by all of the forecasts that we made,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We indicated in the budget we expect good employment growth over the course of the year, we think we will get that,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the important thing to remember is we have got to look two, three, four, five years down the track and that's what we are doing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if the establishment of the Cabinet committee was a concession that unemployment was about to get a lot worse, he said: &quot;Of course it's not.&quot;</p>
