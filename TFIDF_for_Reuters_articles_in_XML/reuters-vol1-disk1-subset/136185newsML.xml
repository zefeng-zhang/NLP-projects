<headline>AT&amp;T transition makes Walter CEO in Jan. '98.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp said on Wednesday its executive succession plan calls for John Walter to take over from Robert Allen as chief executive officer and chairman in separate steps in 1998.</p>
<p>An AT&amp;T spokesman said Walter would become CEO in January 1998, and take the reins as chairman at the company's annual meeting later that year.</p>
<p>The annual meeting typically occurs in April.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T announced today that it had selected Walter, chief of the printing company R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co, as Allen's successor.  </p>
<p>Walter was named president, chief operating officer and a member of the AT&amp;T board, effective November 1.</p>
<p>Allen, in a statement, said, &quot;The board and I have every expectation that John will become chairman and CEO of AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to split the CEO and chairman roles in January 1998, and I would expect John to succeed me as chairman at the AT&amp;T annual meeting later that year.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen's comment about splitting roles should not be taken to mean Allen and Walter will share the posts of chairman and CEO in the period between January 1998 and the annual meeting that year, the company spokesman said.</p>
