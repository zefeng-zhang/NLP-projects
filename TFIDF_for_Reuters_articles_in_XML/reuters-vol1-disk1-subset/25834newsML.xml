<title>UK: Thatcher denies she's to quit UK Conservatives.</title>
<headline>Thatcher denies she's to quit UK Conservatives.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The office of Margaret Thatcher on Saturday denied a report that the former British prime minister intended to quit the Conservative Party she led for 15 years.</p>
<p>&quot;We deny this whole-heartedly - 110 percent. It's absolute poppycock,&quot; a spokesman told reporters.</p>
<p>The report in Saturday's Guardian newspaper said Thatcher was ready to cut her ties with the Conservatives and lend her support to the recently-formed Referendum Party, which wants a referendum on closer British ties with the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;She's not joining the Referendum Party. She's not supporting it. She's going to the (Cosnervative) party conference in October as a loyal supporter of the prime minister,&quot; her spokesman added.</p>
<p>Thatcher, never a fan of the European Union, has spoken out strongly since leaving office against a single European currency and what some British MP's see as interference by Brussels in British affairs.</p>
<p>She has given donations to Conservative &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; groups and has also let it be known that she will not campaign for Conservatives who oppose the holding of a referendum on Europe during general elections to be held by May 1997.</p>
