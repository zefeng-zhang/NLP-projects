<p>Recently-listed shares stole the limelight in Singapore on Tuesday, fuelled by good performances of Delifrance Asia and Labroy Marine, the two latest additions, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the top actives are shares that had been listed this year,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;They have been boosted by the good sentiment in Delifrance and Labroy.&quot;</p>
<p>Delifrance, which was listed on Monday, ended up Singapore $0.06 at S$1.03 on 18 million shares. Labroy Marine, listed last Friday, ended up S$0.15 at S$1.10 on 25 million shares.  </p>
<p>SMB United firmed to S$0.32 against its IPO price of S$0.29. Advanced System Automation also ended up at S$0.95 against its IPO price of S$0.86. CM Telecom and Presscrete were also among the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index closed 5.39 points down at 2,038.84. Turnover improved to 154 million shares, with gainers leading losers by 206 to 102.</p>
<p>UOB Foreign and CityDev led the gainers, rising S$0.30 and S$0.20 respectively to S$13.20 and S$10.60.</p>
