<title>BELGIUM: EU Commission to report on taxation policy.</title>
<headline>EU Commission to report on taxation policy.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Commission will make a fresh call on Tuesday for greater coordination of national taxation policies in a bid to avoid tax arbitrage in the EU's single market and help create jobs, EU sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>In a report due to be adopted at its weekly meeting, the Commission will stress that different tax systems are distorting the rules of the game in a borderless Union.</p>
<p>More importantly, the report shows that the constant rise over the years of taxation on labour --  which is proportional to a decrease on fiscal revenues from capital -- considerably undermines the changes of reducing the bloc's huge unemployment.</p>
<p>The report addressed to EU finance ministers says that the average tax rate on salary income rose to 40.5 percent in 1994 from 34.7 percent in 1980.</p>
<p>In the same period, taxation on other producing factors -- chiefly capital and self-employment -- went from 44.1 percent to 35.2 percent.</p>
<p>But despite this shift of the taxation burden to labour and a curfrent EU unemployment rate of 10.8 percent, the report does not propose any concrete measures.</p>
<p>This is not because Mario Monti, the highly respected Italian economics academic in charge of the EU's single market, lacks ideas. Rather he is tired of preaching in the wilderness.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want the ECOFIN (Finance ministers council) to look at the report and throw it in the rubbish bin&quot;, a Commission official said.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers have so far systematically prevented any significant progress in the taxation area. This will continue until, if ever, the 15 EU states do away with the unanimous vote rule governing taxation and foreign and security matters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the report -- a working paper for a greater coordination of fiscal policies -- will assert a few principles.</p>
<p>One of the most controversial is that different tax systems, and in some cases no taxation at all, result in unfair competition.</p>
<p>This applies to the taxation of capital gains -- on securities or bank deposits -- an issue on which mainly Germany and Belgium have fought neighbouring tax-haven Luxembourg.</p>
<p>The report is expected to be discussed by finance ministers at their next meeting on November 11 before being forwarded to December's EU summit in Dublin.</p>
<p>At their last summit in Florence in June, EU leaders encouraged the Commission to develop a new approach to taxation. A high level group of finance ministers's representatives has since met several times.</p>
