<p>Robusta coffee futures seesawed to end tightly mixed after further advances in New York lifted prices that had been hammered by origin and fund selling.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was dragged up by New York,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It's a New York-led market at the moment and London will follow if New York displays exceptional strength.&quot;</p>
<p>London prices gapped marginally higher at the open but quickly moved into the minus column as origin and fund selling emerged to capitalise on Tuesday's sharp gains.</p>
<p>By the close, most-active January was $2 off at $1,425 a tonne after ranging from between $1,401 and $1,432.</p>
<p>March was also $2 lower at $1,378 while front-month November was $9 down at $1,538. The remaining months were up $2 to $8 up.</p>
<p>November's premium to January, an indicator of nearby supply tightness, remained at a hefty $113 at tbe close. Overall volume was 4,504 lots.</p>
<p>New York arabica coffee futures shot up toward midday but traders noted the market's strength centred on the spot December contract, reflecting persistent nearby supply woes.</p>
<p>Traders said with almost negligible U.S. certified stocks no longer seen as a major market influence, the attention is now turned to the situation in key grower Colombia as a truckers' strike entered its 10th day Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;People are looking now at the Colombian situation and arrivals from Mexico and Costa Rica,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The country's coffee chief Jorge Cardenas said on Tuesday the strike had paralysed the nation's coffee industry and forced delays in the shipment of about 250,000 60-kg bags of coffee promised for delivery in October, or a quarter of the month's total.</p>
