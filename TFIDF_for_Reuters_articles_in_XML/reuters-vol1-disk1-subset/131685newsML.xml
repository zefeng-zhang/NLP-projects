<p>Norway's largest listed company Norsk Hydro ASA on Monday blamed lower prices for aluminium and petrochemicals for a 45 percent slump in third-quarter net profits.</p>
<p>The diversified industrial group reported profits after tax of 909 million crowns ($139 million) for the three months to September 30 against 1.66 billion crowns in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>Apart from its aluminium and petrochemicals problems, Hydro said tax provisions also rose due to increased earnings from the group's offshore oil and gas activities.</p>
<p>For the first nine months, Hydro posted a net income of 4.19 billion crowns, 27 percent down from 5.77 billion crowns a year earlier. Pre-tax profits for the period amounted to 8.40 billion crowns against 9.02 billion.</p>
<p>The results fell slightly short of expectations and Hydro's share price slipped two crowns to 304 crowns in early trade.</p>
<p>Third-quarter operating income of 2.15 billion crowns was 21 percent down from 2.72 billion. It included a writedown of 400 million crowns from a downward revision of estimates for remaining oil and gas reserves in the North Sea Frigg area.</p>
<p>The writedown was in addition to a 755 million crown writedown for the Lille-Frigg field that the company took in the second quarter of 1995. Excluding the writedown, operating income was six percent down from last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline was due to significantly lower earnings for light metals and petrochemicals,&quot; a statement from the company said. &quot;Oil and gas showed a marked improvement in operating income, while results for agriculture showed a moderate reduction compared to the previous year.&quot;</p>
<p>Third-quarter operating income for light metals slumped more than 80 percent to 158 million crowns against 943 million. That was due to lower aluminium prices, weaker margins in general for semi-fabricated products and reduced electricity production.</p>
<p>Hydro spokesman Odd Gullberg said the company saw no valid fundamental reason for the market's weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand why the aluminium price is so low. There has been no fall in demand and stocks are not increasing. It could be that someone is manipulating the market,&quot; Gullberg told a news conference.</p>
<p>Income was also dented by unrealised losses of 119 million related to the group's aluminium trading activities. Hydro said it expected poor market conditions to persist, leading to a weak result for aluminium operations in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Operating income for oil and gas was 1.35 billion crowns in the third quarter, a rise of 57 percent from 859 million crowns a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the negative impact of the pre-notified writedown of 400 million crowns related to the Frigg area, operating income for oil and gas was nearly 500 million crowns above that in the third quarter of 1995. Improved margins both for refining and retail marketing helped,&quot; Hydro said.</p>
<p>Operating income from the agriculture division slid nine percent to 526 million, partly burdened by delays in the start up of an ammonia plant in Trinidad following an upgrade.</p>
<p>The outlook for the fertiliser market looked set to remain in good balance, the company said.</p>
<p>But the global market for vinylchloride monomer (VCM) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) continued to suffer from weak demand and low prices in the third quarter, although prices increased slightly towards the end of the period.</p>
<p>Petrochemicals operating income tumbled 66 percent to 118 million crowns from 348 million crowns in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The cyclical developments are still lagging in some parts of Europe. We don't expect any rapid increase in the growth rate,&quot; Leiv Nergaard, Hydro's executive vice president and chief financial officer, told the company's Profile newsletter.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a case of glorious oil and heavy metals,&quot; said an Oslo-based analyst. &quot;But there is little upside potential and in the short term I'm a little anxious. There's a higher likelihood of negative news than positive.</p>
<p>&quot;But the company has a good management and they appear to be trying to move downstream and add value. I'm positive in the longer term,&quot; he said. ($1=6.537 Norwegian Crown)</p>
