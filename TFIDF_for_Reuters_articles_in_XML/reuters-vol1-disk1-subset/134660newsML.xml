<headline>TV growth fuels competition in Indonesia ad market.</headline>

<p>Indonesia's advertising market has becoming increasingly competitive with an exploding growth in the amount of available television airtime, according to a report released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Zenith Media said that, while Indonesia's advertising market was restricted by low average disposable income, it had grown rapidly since the dissolution of the state broadcasting monopoly in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;After the subsequent launch of five commercial terrestrial broadcasters, and the explosion of available airtime, the market has become highly competitive,&quot; the report, Television in Asia Pacific to 2001&quot;, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Broadcasters have introduced more flexible airtime pricing arrangements to gain an edge over their competition,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Zenith said broadcasters were hindered by poor television infrastructure.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) the pool of advertisers and consumers should widen as the economy grows to encompass one of the largest television advertising markets in the region,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>About $668 million was spent on television advertising in Indonesia in 1995, which represented a 29 percent growth over 1994.</p>
<p>The figure was forecast to rise to $770 million this year and $1.5 billion by the year 2001, at constant 1995 prices.</p>
<p>While Indonesia has the fourth biggest population in the world, only about 40 percent of all homes have television, said Zenith, which is the media-planning and -buying arm of Cordiant Plc, which also owns Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising.</p>
