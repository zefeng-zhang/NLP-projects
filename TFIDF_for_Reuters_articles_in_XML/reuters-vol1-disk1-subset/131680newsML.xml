<headline>German coffee physicals ruled by nearby tightness.</headline>

<p>Firm prices are expected to hold in Germany's physical coffee market as nearby tightness begins to extend into early 1997, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Roasters expecting to fill gaps in their cover for this year find differentials (over futures) prohibitive, if the material is at all available,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Central Americans and Colombians attract high premiums for 1996 and levels have also hardened for early next year.&quot;</p>
<p>But traders added there were sufficient Brazils on offer at reasonable prices and good quality to avoid a panic among consumers.</p>
<p>Another factor offsetting the tightness was only average consumption, which was unlikely to change unless the winter got to be extremely harsh.</p>
<p>&quot;If a cold winter lifted coffee consumption above current levels, the supply situation in early 1997 could become quite difficult,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally, all eyes are on the pace of the new crop arrivals.&quot;</p>
<p>The physical scenario was in contrast to sharp futures losses in New York arabicas as a result of speculative and producer selling last Friday.</p>
<p>Benchmark December closed at 109.10 cents/lb, off 0.80.</p>
<p>But traders here believed the market may move sideways this week, based on its ability to hold key support at 108.50.</p>
<p>In the Bremen import market, Brazils were offered at $106 per 50 kg fob, down $9 on the week, and Colombia Excelso was at $128, down $6.</p>
<p>Kenyan price fell less sharply to $150 from $156 a week earlier and Indonesian robustas were off $3 at $62.</p>
<p>Roasters bought arabicas for the first half of 1996 but interest in robustas was limited because of the prospect of large Asian crops.</p>
