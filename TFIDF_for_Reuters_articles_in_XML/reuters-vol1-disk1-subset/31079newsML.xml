<p>Shares in international engineering company BBA Group Plc moved ahead on Wednesday after a 19 percent rise in first half profits, the top end of market expectations, analysts said.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits rose to 72.1 million stg before exceptionals. The dividend was raised 17 percent to 2.1 pence.</p>
<p>The shares moved 8-1/2p higher to 331-1/2p.</p>
<p>&quot;The results were at the upper end of forecasts. Cash flow was also very strong in the first half -- much stronger than most people had anticipated,&quot; said SG Strauss Turnbull analyst Andy Chambers.  </p>
<p>Ongoing cash flows plus the ability to gear up would be used for bolt-on acquistions, BBA said.</p>
<p>&quot;If an opportunity arises they'll look for another leg but the bolt-ons are the priority in the short-term,&quot; said Chambers.</p>
<p>The company said transportation's friction unit had enjoyed a good period in the face of tough market conditions in Germany and an investment programme is expected to result in reduced costs and improved productivity later in the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany is going to be pretty slow second half for friction materials primarily because the heavy commercial vehicle market there is still fairly flat,&quot; said Chambers.  </p>
<p>&quot;They do, however, have the benefit of the investment programme, which should improve efficiency,&quot; said Chambers.</p>
<p>Strong growth was coming through from the industrial businesses, mainly the non-woven business and Ajax, the induction heating business, and the electrical distributions and aerospace component businesses had not performed badly, he said.</p>
<p>Non-woven products performed in line with forecasts, with operating margins and market shares improving.</p>
<p>The filtration business is seen affording more growth potential this year and sound sales and easing of raw material costs pointed to encouraging prospects ahead, said BBA.</p>
