<p>Major Czech shares regained ground in the continuous trading on Wednesday after earlier losses, to help push the Prague Stock Exchange's PX50 index up to a new 1996 high.</p>
<p>Most major issues fell at the Prague Stock Exchange daily fixing, but Komercni Banka, Ceska Sporitelna, SPT Telecom and Komercni Investment Fund managed to bounced back in late trading to recover at least some of the early losses.</p>
<p>Broader issues helped to boost the official PX50 up 0.6 points, or 0.1 percent to 580.8 points on turnover of 886.7 million crowns.</p>
<p>Overall on the market, 1.1 million shares changed hands while 183 issues rose, outpacing the 152 decliners, and 82 stocks remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Market leaders SPT Telecom and CEZ closed two and nine crowns lower at 3,404 and 1,041 respectively.</p>
<p>Komernci Banka's investment fund lost in the morning but came back, closing five crowns higher at 723. Chemical concern Chemopetrol gained three crowns to 1,323.</p>
<p>Pulp and paper companies Biocel and Sepap continued in their recent growth, but dealers said their tight shareholder structure with majority owners was not a good factor and that there were very low volumes of those issues available.</p>
<p>Jan Sykora of the Prague brokerage Wood and Company said the current declines of the most capitalised stocks were not significant as the volumes traded were low.</p>
<p>He added that foreign investors, who were slightly cutting their positions here, could come back later this fall, but warned of the prevailing problems of the Czech market including lack of regulation and transparency.</p>
