<p>Former military ruler Gen. Augusto Pinochet hinted on Tuesday that Chile's armed forces could someday carry out another coup like the one in 1973 that brought them to power for 17 years.</p>
<p>Speaking to rightist supporters in a Santiago social club, Pinochet recounted his role in the violent coup in which troops overthrew elected Marxist President Salvador Allende and instituted military rule.</p>
<p>&quot;We arrived in the year 1973, when a socialist president had left. And take care -- we could do it again,&quot; Pinochet said.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether he meant that Chile could elect a socialist government again or that the military might stage another coup. But his audience burst into applause, suggesting they understood him to mean the latter.</p>
<p>The 80-year-old Pinochet is still commander-in-chief of the army and the undisputed ideological leader of Chile's powerful armed forces.</p>
<p>The statement may have been a reference to popular Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos, a socialist and Pinochet opponent during military rule who holds a wide lead in public opinion polls for the 1999 presidential elections.</p>
