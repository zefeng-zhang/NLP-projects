<p>Shenzhen Konka Electronic Group Co Ltd said it is due to make a three-for-10 rights offer to B shareholders following the completion of a rights issue to holders of A shares and legal person shares in July.</p>
<p>The offer to its B shareholders has been priced at HK$5.85 per rights share, Konka said in a prospectus published in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times.</p>
<p>On Friday, Konka's B shares closed at HK$6.80 per share.</p>
<p>The deadline to register for the offer has been set at October 29 and Konka's B shares will go ex-rights the following day, the prospectus said.</p>
<p>China Southern Securities has been appointed the chief domestic underwriter for the rights offer, with W.I. Carr Indosuez Capital Asia Ltd the international coordinator, Konka said.</p>
<p>Konka said it expected the B rights offer to be fully taken up and to raise about 218 million yuan in net proceeds.</p>
<p>The colour television maker said it plans to use the proceeds to expand its core operations and supplement working capital.  </p>
<p>Konka currently has total share capital of 330.11 million shares, including 213.56 million founder shares, 79.28 million A shares, 37.18 million B shares and 86,266 staff shares, according to the prospectus.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Konka told the Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin that Konka's rights offer to A shareholders was successful and Konka had racked up net proceeds of 329.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the B rights offer will be mostly channeled into the same projects being financed by its A rights proceeds, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said those included the ongoing construction of a 210,000-sq-metre electronics product production complex in the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province.</p>
<p>Some proceeds would also be used to expand the sales of its televisions abroad by setting up outlets in Hong Kong and Russia, the official added.</p>
