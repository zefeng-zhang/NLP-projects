<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will meet for the first time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting between President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu will be held today at 5:30 (1430 GMT),&quot; PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters in Palestinian-ruled Gaza.</p>
<p>Israel's Government Press Office confirmed the meeting would take place at the Erez border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had been struggling over the past week to find a formula that would enable the leaders to meet and for fully fledged peace talks to resume.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May on a vow to take a hard line in peace talks with the Palestinians, had said originally he preferred not to meet Arafat but softened his position in recent days.</p>
<p>Palestinians had been pressing for a summit and resumed talks to tackle the issue of Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>The sides had been tussling over the wording of a document that would commit Israel's current government to the groundbreaking interim peace deal which late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sealed with Arafat when they shook hands on the White House lawn in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;In this meeting we hope we can put the mechanism by which we will be able to proceed with all our negotiations in order for us to carry out the implementation of the interim agreement,&quot; Erekat said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope we can put the peace process back on track. Putting the peace process back on track means only the implementation of the interim agreement on the ground,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we need deeds and not words.&quot;</p>
<p>The announcement followed four days of round-the-clock talks to fix a summit seen as vital to reviving peace talks suspended since Islamic suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
<p>Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said Netanyahu had resisted making a commitment to implementing the 1993 self-rule deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said the agreement on Hebron, where Israeli troops are to remain in parts of the city to ensure the safety of 400 Jewish settlers living in enclaves among more than 100,000 Arabs, must be re-examined due to security concerns.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's communications director David Bar-Illan said on Tuesday: &quot;The thrust of the meeting between the prime minister and Arafat is to confirm that an agreement has been reached on the agenda of the negotiations and to seal it with a handshake.&quot;</p>
<p>In the May election, Netanyahu ousted Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres who in November succeeded Rabin, assassinated by a Jew opposed to peace moves with the Palestinians.</p>
