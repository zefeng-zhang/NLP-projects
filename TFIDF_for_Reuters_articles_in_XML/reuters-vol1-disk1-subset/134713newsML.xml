<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that French President Jacques Chirac had delivered a positive report from Syria and he hoped to revive peace talks with Damascus.</p>
<p>&quot;The message was a positive message but it seems to me that on these things it's better to say little,&quot; Netanyahu told a news conference after they met. Chirac met Syrian President Hafez al-Assad for 14 hours before arriving in Israel, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we very much value the readiness of France to try to help us in the effort we are making in order to reach a discussion obviously -- obviously in the end to renew the bilateral negotaitons between us and Syria,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>About talks with Palestinians on a long promised Israeli troop pullback from Hebron, the Israeli leader said: &quot;It's close to an end, it's not yet finished. I hope it will end quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May, said he expected that when agreement was reached, he and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat would meet to announce the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that the moment we reach the finish line there could be -- and it's even desirable for there to be -- a meeting between me and Arafat in order to close all the loose ends and enable of course the official announcement on the end of the negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
