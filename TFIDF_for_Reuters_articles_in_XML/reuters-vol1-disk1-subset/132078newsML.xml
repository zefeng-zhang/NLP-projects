<p>China is banking on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to resurrect communist puritanism with the publication of a collection of the ailing former revolutionary's writings on socialist ethics.</p>
<p>The release on Sunday of the 73,000-Chinese character book &quot;Deng Xiaoping on the Promotion of Socialist Ethical and Cultural Progress&quot; was a major event in China's political life, the military mouthpiece People's Liberation Army Daily said on Monday.</p>
<p>China's communist leadership this month launched a wide-ranging propaganda campaign to &quot;build spiritual civilisation&quot; -- official code for boosting Marxist values weakened in the rush from socialism to the market economy.</p>
<p>Deng, 92, was the architect of China's economic reforms and is believed to remain highly influential, although he no longer holds any official position. He has not been seen in public since early 1994 and is reported to be in fragile health.</p>
<p>The eight-part book, compiled by the Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party from the first three volumes of Deng's selected works, was being distributed across China, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the theoretical foundation for the mansion of our nation's socialist spiritual civilisation,&quot; the People's Liberation Army Daily said in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an important educational material for the widening of spiritual civilisation education and a scientific guidebook for progress in the construction of spiritual civilisation,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Communist Party officials should study the book together with the writings of current party chief Jiang Zemin, it said.</p>
<p>Analysts say Jiang, seen by many as a transitional figure unlikely to retain power after Deng's death, is anxious to use ideological campaigns to bolster his position.</p>
