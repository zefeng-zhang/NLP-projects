<p>A Hong Kong pro-democracy politician on Sunday called for the establishment of an appeals body to deal with complaints over the selection of Hong Kong's first chief executive after the 1997 handover to China.</p>
<p>A different group should administer, monitor and handle complaints related to the selection of the chief executive, Frederick Fung, chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, said on government radio.</p>
<p>&quot;There's an inclination to have a secretariat take care of the operational details,&quot; Fung said.</p>
<p>&quot;While we support the idea of having the board of directors to be the referee of the important event, we would like to see an independent body appointed by the Preparatory Committee to be their appeal committee,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After more than 150 years as a British colony, Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight on June 30, 1997. The territory's first post-handover chief executive is expected to be chosen in November.</p>
<p>Fung is a member of the China-handpicked Preparatory Committee overseeing the formation of a 400-member selection committee which will choose the chief executive and form a provisional legislature that replaces the elected chamber.</p>
<p>The crucial months ahead hold promise of drama, and some outspoken politicians have charged that Beijing has already decided who the future chief executive would be.</p>
<p>Shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa has been widely tipped as the favoured candidate, with even his colleages in the Preparatory Committee endorsing him publicly.</p>
<p>But a senior China official denied that the matter had been already decided.</p>
<p>&quot;The chief executive must be selected by the Selection Committee, just like the make-up of the provisional legislature ...there is no possibility of it being internally decided,&quot; said Zhang Junsheng, vice-director of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua, China's de facto embassy, at a public function.</p>
<p>The nomination process for the Selection Committee, which will be formed in October, has thrown Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp into a quandary, especially after Beijing's unexpected gesture last week of inviting democrats on board.</p>
<p>The populist Democratic Party has long rejected the idea of joining the committee as it would amount to recognising the provisional legislature which the party regards as illegal.</p>
<p>The party argues China's plan to scrap the present elected legislature and appoint a new &quot;provisional&quot; one for the handover has no basis in law or in handover treaties with London.</p>
<p>Pressure mounted when a poll conducted by the party revealed that more than half the respondents wanted the party to have representation on the transition body.</p>
<p>The party's posture has drawn criticism from a rival party.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unacceptable for these people to want to continue to play the game of confrontation, which is to the detriment of Hong Kong,&quot; Allen Lee, leader of pro-business Liberal Party and member on the Preparatory Committee, said.</p>
