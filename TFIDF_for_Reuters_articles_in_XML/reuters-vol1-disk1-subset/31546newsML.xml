<title>BURUNDI: Tanzania delays U.S. plane in Burundi.</title>

<p>Tanzania's refusal to allow a U.S. airforce C-141 Starlifter to overfly its territory has delayed the plane's departure from Burundi, airport security officers and diplomats said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than five hours after landing, the transport plane was still parked at Bujumbura airport because of an argument over whether it was affected by regional sanctions against Burundi.</p>
<p>Fighting between government troops and Hutu rebels flared up a few miles to the east of the capital on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that Tanzania hasn't given clearance for the plane to take off,&quot; a senior airport security official told Reuters.</p>
<p>African states banned all air links with Burundi as part of sanctions imposed after a military coup on July 25.</p>
<p>A U.S. embassy spokesman in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, denied the Starlifter was sent to war-torn Burundi to evacuate the few remaining U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an evacuation. It is a routine embassy support flight,&quot; Louis Segesvary said.</p>
<p>But a Reuters correspondent at Bujumbura airport said 31 foreigners, including Americans, were in the departure lounge waiting to board the plane. Several said they were leaving Burundi because stepped-up fighting between the army and rebels had made it impossible to carry on their work.</p>
<p>U.S. diplomats in Burundi said negotiations to seek clearance from Tanzania to overfly the country en route to Nairobi were continuing.</p>
