<p>Wicketkeeper Rashid Latif kept his head while wickets tumbled to steer Pakistan to a two-wicket victory over England in the third and final one-day international at Trent Bridge on Sunday.</p>
<p>England won the series 2-1 after losing the three-test series 2-0.</p>
<p>Rashid calmly square cut Adam Hollioake for four from the second ball of the final over then chipped the Surrey all-rounder into vacant territory for the winning run with two balls to spare.</p>
<p>He finished on 31 not out after Hollioake had threatened to steal the match for England by taking four quick wickets as Pakistan chased England's 246 all out from their 50 overs.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to pay tribute to Rashid,&quot; said Pakistan captain Wasim Akram. &quot;He played very well.&quot;  </p>
<p>Hollioake took four for 23 from 6.5 overs for England in Saturday's 107-run win at Edgbaston and was on course to repeat his match-winning performance on Sunday before Rashid took control.</p>
<p>&quot;He bowled well in two pressure situations,&quot; said England captain Mike Atherton. &quot;He dragged us back into the game today.&quot;</p>
<p>Warwickshire opener Nick Knight hit his second hundred in two days to provide the backbone for the England innings.</p>
<p>Knight, who scored his maiden test century in the recent series against the Pakistanis, hit a fine 113 in the second one-day match on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Sunday he capped that and completed a superb weekend by carrying his bat for 125 not out from 145 balls.</p>
<p>Knight played with brisk assurance despite seeing wickets fall regularly at the other end and in the 42nd over he pushed occasional left-arm spinner Asif Mujtaba through midwicket for two and punched the air in celebration. His century came from 120 balls and included nine fours.</p>
<p>Pakistan made a brisk start in reply with Saeed Anwar and Shahid Anwar putting on 93 runs for the first wicket and singling out left-arm paceman Allan Mullally for particular punishment.</p>
<p>Saeed was eventually out for the top score of 61 and it was then left to Ijaz Ahmed (59) to keep the runs coming as the remainder of the Pakistan middle order lost their way against Hollioake's medium pace.</p>
