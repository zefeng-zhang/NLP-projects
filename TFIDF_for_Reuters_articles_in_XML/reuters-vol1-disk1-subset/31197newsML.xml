<headline>VLSI names former National Semi COO as president, COO.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE, Calif</dateline>
<text>
<p>VLSI Technology Inc. Wednesday named Richard Beyer, formerly of National Semiconductor Corp., to the post of president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Beyer, 47, will also join VLSI's board of directors.</p>
<p>Beyer resigned from National Semiconductor in June, following several other executives who left after former chief executive officer Gilbert Amelio was recruited by Apple Computer Inc. to run that company.</p>
<p>Beyer resigned as chief operating officer after being passed over for the top job at National Semiconductor. Instead, Brian Halla was named to replace Amelio.</p>
<p>At custom-designed chipmaker VLSI, Beyer will assume key management responsibilities previously held by Alfred Stein, who continues in his role as chief executive officer and chairman of the board.</p>
<p>Beyer assumes the title of president from Stein. The chief operating officer title is a newly-created position.</p>
<p>VLSI Technology had 1995 revenues of $720 million, and approximately 3,000 employees worldwide.</p>
