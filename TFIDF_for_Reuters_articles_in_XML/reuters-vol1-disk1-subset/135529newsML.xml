<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch short-dated money rates nudge up.</title>
<headline>Dutch short-dated money rates nudge up.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch short-dated money rates were edging up on Tuesday with dealers noting that investors were clinging to their liquidity while the Dutch state needed money to pay out salaries and other monthly payments.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is not really short of liquidity as the money the state takes in will be returned to the market straight away as salaries need to be paid,&quot; said one dealer, who added however that this was temporarily pushing up the call rate.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the increase in call money rates also had a slight knock-on effect on other short-dated deposits.</p>
<p>Call money was bid at 2.75 and 2.81 percent, but one dealer said he had also settled some business at 2.87 percent bid.</p>
<p>Two-month deposits rose two basis points to 2.82 percent bid and three-month paper also gained two basis points to 2.84 percent bid.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were some trades done in Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs) by the Dutch government and one said the price had gained one basis point since yesterday.</p>
<p>The dealer said it was too early to say whether the current rise in rates amounted to a trend.</p>
<p>&quot;To me it seems we are in a consolidation phrase, with little upward pressure as some investors are not willing to do business,&quot; said the dealer, adding that the market was still hoping for an easing of rates in Germany.</p>
<p>Dealers do not generally foresee any such move in Germany in the short term, but said they were still hoping for a repo rate cut before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The guilder was virtually unchanged at 112.170 per 100 marks from 112.175 on Monday.</p>
