<p>Masked gunmen in black boots roamed the woods and the sound of gunfire split the afternoon air. An old man with a walking stick called out the names of his children as loud bangs echoed nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you seen my little boy? Where is my boy?&quot; a woman cried plaintively from amidst a crowd huddled under pine trees.</p>
<p>Rather than war-torn Bosnia or Rwanda, the backdrop to this latest &quot;crisis&quot; was the otherwise tranquil, sunlit lawns of the classical Palais des Nations in Geneva, the United Nations headquarters in Europe.</p>
<p>The goal was not survival but education, and the &quot;victims&quot; were some 50 people including children who participated in a simulation game organised by the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR on Sunday on what it feels like to be displaced by war.</p>
<p>The game, first launched in August 1995, is part of a new campaign by the Geneva-based UNHCR -- with some 26 million refugees and displaced people around the world under its wing -- to educate the public on the problems faced by refugees.</p>
<p>It has been played so far in Kenya, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Africa's Great Lakes region, scene of the world's biggest refugee crisis, could be next.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave all your bags behind, for this will be a journey not like any other journey,&quot; UNHCR official Sylvie Daillot, who led the simulation game, told volunteers drawn from members of the public visiting the Palais on United Nations day.</p>
<p>&quot;Without trivialising what they go through, we are going to try to understand what it feels like to be a refugee,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a quiet day. You're with your family. Suddenly, without warning, bombs start falling,&quot; she said after the volunteers were blindfolded and taken to different points of the grounds to the sound of recorded explosions.</p>
<p>The participants started shouting and screaming, hands outstretched, calling out the names of relatives, mirroring the all too real terror that refugees often have to face.</p>
<p>Apart from the amateur dramatics by UNHCR staff and the recorded hubbub of the simulation game, the only other sounds in the elegant gardens of the Palais were the twittering of birds enjoying the late autumn sunshine and the peaceful murmuring of car engines in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Jostled and harassed by role players, the groups stumbled through a wooded slope, the ground covered by autumn leaves, and came to a mock holding area and huddled under plastic sheeting.</p>
<p>Moments later, two menacing men in black masks rushed from behind the bushes firing imitation handguns at the volunteers.</p>
<p>Children screamed and dived for cover. On the horizon, the snow-capped peak of Mont Blanc and the blue-green waters of Lake Leman made for a surreal background.</p>
<p>At a make believe frontier marked by a string roadblock, border guards with sticks hit the refugees, albeit lightly, and pushed them around. They even staged a mock execution.</p>
<p>A border official, playing his part, walked around, speaking Polish and handing out registration forms in Cyrillic. When asked for help, he rubbed his fingers, asking for bribes.</p>
<p>For at least one little boy, expecting perhaps a more leisurely celebration of U.N. day, the role playing seemed a little too good as he gingerly shook hands with one of the unmasked &quot;gunmen&quot;.</p>
<p>Many participants said they could now perhaps go some way to understanding some of the fear and panic felt by refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;The soldiers were frightening. I felt helpless,&quot; said eight-year-old Fanny Duhr, participating with her parents.</p>
<p>Yacouba Konate, an anthropologist visiting from Mali, said: &quot;It was an eye-opener for me. Now I'm better prepared to understand what it feels like to be a refugee.&quot;</p>
<p>Daillot told Reuters on Monday: &quot;We need to change attitudes towards refugees and we need to educate the public. We're thinking of playing the game with diplomats, too.&quot;</p>
