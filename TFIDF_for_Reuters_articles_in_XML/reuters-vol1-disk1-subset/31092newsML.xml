<p>British government bonds look set to benefit in the short term from the troubles dogging other European bond markets, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>International investors have been wary of the British gilt market, fearing that political concerns -- with an election due by May 1997 -- made it too risky. But that situation may be changing.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of Europe is suffering from budget uncertainty, currency jitters and now the rising oil price,&quot; said Kirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa International. &quot;But the U.K. is shielded from that and will perform better on a relative basis.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said gilts were unlikely to rally in view of the current weakness in U.S. Treasuries and the consolidation in German Bunds but they offered scope for a narrowing of the interest rate spread.</p>
<p>Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said gilts would narrow the spread over Bunds back below 160 basis points (1.60 percentage point), although probably not much further. It stood at 166 basis points on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts are out of the fray. EMU is not really in focus, politics are in the background and we have a good inflation picture,&quot; he said, referring to European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>As a net exporter of oil, Britain would be unlikely to face the same inflationary pressures from a higher oil price as countries dependent on imports. Oil prices have been boosted after Iraqi incursions into Kurdish areas and retaliatory U.S. missile attacks.</p>
<p>Analysts said the fundamental backdrop for gilts contrasted with other European countries.</p>
<p>Investors have recently been wary of French assets as the government there is currently embroiled in a dispute with unions over plans to cut fiscal spending. Pressure on the French franc revived after news that second quarter gross domestic product shrank 0.4 percent, more than the market had expected.</p>
<p>Italian bonds are also struggling as the 1997 budget is under discussion amid squabbles over public spending.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts have a chance to outperform many of the non- deutschemark holdings,&quot; said Shah. He said the spread between Italian BTPs and Bunds would widen back to 350 basis points. It was at 317 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Richardson said there would be some benefit to gilts if Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke did not press for a cut in interest rates at Wednesday's meeting of the British monetary authorities.</p>
<p>Some analysts have expressed concern that the Chancellor might be prepared to sacrifice economic prudence in order to boost the ruling Conservative Party's chances of re-election.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Chancellor doesn't cut, it would demonstrate a more rigorous approach to monetary policy,&quot; said Richardson.</p>
<p>Shah said he expected the spread to come in as far as 150 points and recommended investors to go overweight in gilts.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling is undervalued compared to the franc and the lira,&quot; he said. &quot;That's an added reason to go long.&quot;</p>
<p>Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London, said the pound sterling would benefit from a period of stability on interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts should outperform core Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;The short end is too pessimistic in factoring in that the next move in rates will be up.&quot; He added there was room for a 25 basis point cut.</p>
<p>Shah said scope for British rates to fall would be scuppered once U.S. rates were raised, commenting: &quot;The door will close when the Fed (Federal Reserve) raises rates. The U.S. will lead the markets.&quot;</p>
