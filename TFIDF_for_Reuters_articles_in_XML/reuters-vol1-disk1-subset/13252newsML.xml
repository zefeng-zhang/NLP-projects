<p>Israeli shares closed higher in light trading despite declining activity, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 2.65 points, or 1.53 percent, to 175.93 on an all-share turnover of only 43 million shekels against 51 million on Thursday, the last day of trading before the Israeli weekend.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 index gained 1.68 percent to 187.26.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing to do in the market today. The market is rising but activity is minimal. Overall the market is simply boring,&quot; said Danni Scharia at Capital Investments.</p>
<p>Another trader echoed Scharia's remarks: &quot;Activity is so low that there is simply nothing to do. Such a low turnover is realy disgraceful,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Koor Industries, the second most active share, rose 2.0 percent to 28,359 on volume of 2.7 million shekels after the company announced it had signed an agreement to sell its 66 percent stake in Sefen to Etz Lavud Ltd for $12 million.</p>
<p>Makhteshim Chemical Works rose 3.0 percent to 1,638 after Salomon Brothers issued a strong buy recommendation for the company's share. Salomon has also increased its estimate on Makhteshim's earnings per share from $0.46 to $0.53 for 1996 and from $0.51 to $0.61 for 1997.</p>
<p>The most active share was Africa Israel Investments, which rose 3.0 percent to 394,908 on volume of only 3.0 million shekels. Traders said that trading in the share had been suspended after the company said it would make an important announcement. No announcement was given by the end of the trading day.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries rose 3.25 percent to 115,503 following the rise of its shares on NASDAQ.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.16 shekels)</p>
