<p>About 50 Africans seized in a raid on a Paris church, including hunger strikers, were released on Sunday after a string of court victories over detention orders and a police about-turn.</p>
<p>The releases meant only a fraction of the 210 people arrested in the Saint-Bernard church on Friday, when the 10 hunger strikers were in the 50th day of a fast against French expulsion orders and strict immigration laws, were still in detention.</p>
<p>Despite the releases, many of the Africans still face the threat of expulsion. Most of the Africans are from Mali, Senegal and Zaire.</p>
<p>Six hunger strikers, looking drawn and tired but smiling and able to walk unaided, were released from the Vincennes detention centre east of Paris on Sunday after police decided not to seek an extension of their custody in a change of policy.</p>
<p>Supporters cheered as they walked free.</p>
<p>Another three of the hunger strikers were released from hospital and a 10th had been quietly released on Saturday night, police said. Police said they planned to grant just one of the 10 a residence permit and expel the rest.</p>
<p>Earlier, about 40 Africans were freed from the Vincennes detention centre on the eastern edge of Paris after a civil court ruled police had made errors in custody orders, including unauthorised signatures on documents.</p>
<p>They embraced friends and relatives as they left, celebrating rulings that were an embarrassment to the centre-right government.</p>
<p>The court that freed the 40 agreed to extend detention for only 13 other Africans. A separate court sentenced three people to jail for up to three months, with another four people getting suspended prison terms.</p>
<p>Four of the Africans were deported on Saturday night on a plane that flew to Mali, Senegal and Zaire as Prime Minister Alain Juppe sought to balance a crackdown on illegal immigration with a promise of greater humanity.</p>
<p>Airport staff in Mali dubbed the French military plane carrying the deportees, who included another 53 facing previous expulsion orders, a &quot;flight of shame&quot; and refused to handle it.</p>
<p>Paris police headquarters said it would appeal against the freeing of the 40 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Leon Schwartzenberg, a human rights activist and cancer specialist, hailed the decision to release the hunger strikers. &quot;We are very pleased about the situation for the hunger strikers, who are very tired,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry said on Saturday that more than 40 of those seized in the church would be granted residence permits in coming days &quot;due to family or health situations&quot;.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers said police headquarters had formally decided to scrap 45 expulsion orders on Sunday.</p>
<p>The church raid triggered protests against the centre-right government and clashes between stone-throwing protesters and riot police in Paris on Friday night and again around a military airbase when the first Africans were deported.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe was meeting President Jacques Chirac in the president's Riviera retreat on Sunday for a weekend of informal talks about government policy, ranging from immigration to unemployment.</p>
<p>The 1993 immigration laws, named after former interior minister Charles Pasqua, are a tangle partly because some immigrants, such as parents of children born in France since 1993, can now neither be expelled nor obtain residence permits.</p>
